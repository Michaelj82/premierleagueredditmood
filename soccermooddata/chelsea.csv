1,"this was probably the most painful performance we've had this season, and that is saying a lot. im convinced we would lose to a league 2 side at this point. we are just laughably bad. waiting 85 minutes to bring on mudryk is so awful.",KAAI HAVERTZ IS THE BEST ON EARTH,We won a game 🥲,We lost to the bottom team of Premier League. At home.,At least Arsenal lost,I was actually excited for this match. Looking forward to it all week.,Cucurella has one play and it’s dribble forward till someone steps and then quick stop and pass backwards to Enzo. Think he played the ball forward to Mudryk 2 times all game,Badiashile looks good,We.fucking.suck.,Very good game ... zero injuries,Won’t be the most depressing game of the year at least,£250m spent in the summer and our best signing is Zakaria who came on a free.,Our best December in years... of course it helps when you only play one game,"That was a very, very rough watch. 

Midfield was non-existent throughout.",I don't think I've ever been more happy at the prospect of not having to watch Chelsea play for an extended period of time... it's an absolutely miserable experience watching them at the moment,Kovacic basically had to hold an entire midfield together by himself.,We can’t even really complain tbh. A draw was deserved from this performance,I captained Toney on fpl by accident. You're welcome.,Ortega motm for sure but hall was a bright spot for Chelsea,Benfica won 6-1 and took top from PSG...so now we could end up with PSG in the last 16?,Shambolic. Awful. Shameful. Take your pick.,"I'm already a big fan of Potter simply because he doesn't stubbornly stick with formations, systems or players that aren't working. He actually manages games in real time.",Conor. Fucking. Gallagher.,Conor was immense today. Glad for Broja to finally bag his first at Chelsea.,The Broja counter attack following that corner near the end feels like the first counter Chelsea have pushed on in like 20 matches.,Man did we need that. Great response after a sloppy first few minutes,"Ordinarily a player walking off the pitch would give me solace that their injury isn't too awful. However, I am of the belief Reece James would walk off with two broken legs.",Not sure how we’re so uncreative with that lineup. Something needs to change quickly but god knows what.,What a shitshow.,"Three things: 

- Start Chilwell

- Mendy with the acting job of a lifetime

- VAR giving us one finally!","Happy with potter, saw the problems, quickly made subs to sort it out, auba for Gallagher was a great sub to sort the midfield out too",Great fucking response from going down to 10 men. Fucking love Thiago Silva. Thought Raheem wasn’t great in the first half but was fantastic in the second.,Pathetic from Taylor and the VAR ref,"we were looking so good with the intensity and control until mendy fucked it up, then it all went downhill"
2,"Zero plan, no patterns of play or distinct style, two wins in sixteen games with only one goal in our last six games. No clear improvement from any players.","Unironically, the lads gave it everything tonight. 
P.S FUCK EMRE CAN",Hey we won a game! All the new players that came in during the summer almost made you forget that fofana was a massive signing for us in the summer. He was easily our best player.,Disgusting. Boring. Waste of time. Fuck off.,"Someone please, for the love of god, just put the ball in the back of the net. Fuck me.",That fulham defense really bossed the game today..,Why doesn’t Cucurella ever pass the damn ball to Mudryk… drives me insane.,Mudryk is that dude,Felix looked like the player we hoped he would be. That red couldn’t have come at a worse time,At least we can’t lose another fa cup final.,"We are incapable of killing off a game. I can’t remember the last time I felt confident in a 1 or even 2 goal lead… I’m fine with not scoring loads of goals, but you can’t just mentally switch off at 1-0","Probably Zakaria's best game for us yet. 

We're tenth with a goal difference of +1 LMAO.",Sterling and Havertz work very well together. On the other side Mount and Pulisic work well together. Really like that group in attack.,That was on par with that Man City match under Conte. Turgid,"What was up with playing from the back, play it around get pressed then someone lumps it forward. Made no tactical sense. Either you play broja to try and hit him as a main man or start someone else.

Also what game was the ref watching Gallagher was getting kicked up and down all game and never got a sniff of a foul all day. Completely ridiculous",You’d normally expect to win after scoring 3 goals. But in all seriousness mentally I don’t think our players ever thought they were down by two goals. Somewhere around the 70th minute we checked out.,I feel that the subs were about 10-15 minutes too late.,Kepa with another strong performance...might've lost if it wasn't for him,"Look at the positives lads:

Hall looks really tidy, good minutes for him.

We created good chances with a half strength side.

Less fixture congestion.

No-one got injured.","How many injuries have we had now? Ridiculously unlucky this season, good thing we signed Cucurella though",Austrian David Luiz had our number the entire match. Can't keep making excuses for this terrible side...,"Broja = elite time waster, held the ball on his own in the corner for like 45 seconds in the last 6 minutes 😂",Tons of respect to Conor. Wordlie goal and the self control to not celebrate your FIRST Chelsea goal against your old team,"Goals by Kai, CP, and Broja.

Great performances all around by Azpi, Kepa, Mason, Conor, etc.

Got to rest Thiago, Mateo, Pierre, Raheem, and Reece a bit for CL.

Nothing to really bitch about today.

Top 4 for the time being with the possibility of Spurs dropping points to Brighton.

Enjoy the day and weekend for once, Blues!","Seems like Ziyech wasn't sabotaging Tuchel, he is just shit","Genuinely feels like this game might have kickstarted our season

Brilliant performance from everyone but special mention to Reece James...best fullback in the world and its not even close","Nice game, enjoyable evening.

Props to mount for being the mount we know and love again. Kova with them risky passes is just chefs kiss, love it when he gets more daring. Chalobah needs some props man, got players coming in to his position yet still keeps his focus and delivers on the pitch(except that one botched attempt at a header?) really liking this.

Overall it was a bitter sweet win, only downside I can think of is this ref being to easy to give cards and fouls. Otherwise we move on to the top baby.","In all my time watching this season, I don't think I've seen a more blatant penalty turned down. Absolute joke.",Sterling must hate this attack with a passion,"CHILLY HIVE WE BACK UP

Fofana faultless. Amazing player. 

Broja deserves a start 100%. 

Let’s string some fucking results from here for fucks sake.","Kepa MOTM for me, what a showing today. Ganna be tough* for Mendy to get his way back into the XI as of now",Thiago fucking Silva. I will never get tired of praising this man.,"Gave up 2 goals because of 2 refereeing mistakes. Fucking embarrassing sport. Absolutely pathetic.

How the fuck do you watch that VAR with Cucu and not think that’s a foul? You can swing players around by their hair in the box? 

I can’t believe that I continue to get emotionally invested in this stupid crooked shit","3 games in, still zero goal from the front 3. Should we stick with Sterling-Havertz-Mount again next game?"
3,"The cheek to say “I’ve just come out a crisis meeting” 

Perform like that, have a lethargic warm up bench and staff interaction. 

Is he not just obviously wanting to get paid off here 😂","I’m so fucking proud of this team for responding to adversity, finally. Everybody deserves flowers for not putting a wrong forward all match. Including the fans at The Bridge.

Everybody did their fucking job and then some. Chilwell, Marc, and Kai ran their god damn hearts out.

Let’s keep pressing on!",Holy shit 3 points feels good,"Fun fact: Southampton had kept one clean sheet in their last 28 matches

Not so fun fact: Graham Potter is managing my club",xG: Dortmund 1.41 v 2.14 Chelsea,Mudryk was getting overloaded and Fulham were letting Ziyech run. That's why he had like 13 touches.,Willian doing better at 34 than any of our attackers this season lol,Encouraging. At the very least.,I could really go for a spring World Cup this year,"0 expectations and I was still let down, senior players and coaching staff need to hang their heads in shame and get it together quickly.","Can’t even beat the worst goddamn team in the league. 

New year, same shit","personal takeaways from this game:

- zakaria can be immense for us
- hall is a baller 
- carney is really good in the advanced midfield role and shows a lot of commitment on the pitch 
- omari i feel isn’t ready to play yet, he was wasteful 
-  thiago silva cannot be allowed to leave 
-  aubameyang is useless 
- cucurella is a lot better than this sub makes him out to be, but unfortunately lacks important commitment in making challenges 
- if we weren’t fucked before, we are well and truly mudded with injuries now
- we actually didn’t play too badly against man city with a line up and performance like this, and would probably beat most teams 
- gallagher has a brilliant mentality and some could learn from it",Really liked every aspect of Havertz's game today,"I just don't get why he doesn't change the damn lineup.  Zakaria and Pulisic play well, nope let's stick with the same 11 that have done fuck all for the past couple of games.",This is why you don’t start a new project with a new manager after the season has started. Especially when the club was already experiencing chaos with the sanctions and change in ownership. Got to have some kind of constant to steady the ship,Sterling was woeful today. Never saw him beat anyone in a 1v1,Worrying how inevitable that United goal was.,"Some big lineup issues in this game. Not enough creativity in the final third. We really need to consider starting Pulisic, Sterling, and Auba. Pulisic and Sterling are pacey and play direct, while Auba is a killer finisher. Full 90 Kai ain’t it. I’d rather we use him as a super sub with fresh legs against tired opponents. On a bright note, looks like Kepa has really turned things around, and Azpi has been covering well in James’ absence","Disappointing but not unexpected. Our lack of finishing was on full display again and it could’ve been a totally different game otherwise. RLC isn’t an out-and-out defender and today we barely saw his skills in progressing play since he was pinned back most of the match.

Despite the two missed chances, Hall was by far our best player on the pitch  and he really deserves some starts/rotation after a confident performance like that. Zakaria was slow tracking back but had some decent moments otherwise, at least he was quick to attempt progressive passes from deep. 

All that in mind city’s keeper was motm and they won this game deservedly. Arsenal lost as well so not the worst day in the world

edit: I reckon the result will be a net-positive in the long run with less fixtures. Our attitude visibly improved from the Arsenal defeat, but we need defensive depth for the right side","Glad for both Sterling and Zakaria.Both of them needed the goals.Sterling to boost his confidence & Zakaria to prove that he can help the team.

Unfortunately the victory became bittersweet as we might lose another player to injury.",The second Ziyech attempt tells me everything about the mental state of his and the rest of the team’s,"Silva, Chalobah, Gallagher, Kova masterclass of a game good fucking lord",Let's appreciate how James took Zaha out of the game completely,Gallagher's energy on the pitch is wonderful to see. I think he can be a big part of Chelsea's future.,"That was early Tuchel-esque. The chances are there, the finishing isn’t, and a mistake costs a goal. Could have been worse imo",Good win. Praying for the health of Fofana,that the real Milan Fik?,"I don't want to hear about Havertz being offside or Cucurella. A competent manager could easily get this team to the top 4. Or at least win a few games against the bottom of the league. Attackers looked really solid in the first half, midfield did well and one defensive mistake is something we will never get 100% rid off. But we where worse after half time and even worse after substitutions. So the more Potter gets involved the worse we play. I know I will get downvoted but 2 wins in 13 is absolutely unacceptable. He does not earn any ""trust"" in his ""process"".",August is the new december.,Need a relaxing day against Zagreb,"Kepa with probably his best individual game for us, maybe ever.          

Otherwise, largely unspectacular game but we move with 3 points. Mase is picking up steam, love to see it",Reece James.,"These commentators can do one. How is such a shambolic performance from the referees a ""great spectacle for the league"". It's a joke.","Sterling - Broja - Pulisic

Mount as attacking midfielder.

Please. For the love of God. Just one half."
4,"Congratulations to our February Goal of the month winner, Joao Felix!","The main thing I’ve taken from tonight is that the team looked like they cared again, and hopefully getting the result after all that effort can drive them forwards from now. Immense performance from every single one of them on the pitch tonight.",THREE FUCKING POINTS LADS,This season is actually more cursed than 15/16. Unbelievable.,"Remember when the ref started the game out by giving the softest yellows to Reece and Thiago then promptly forgot his cards once Dortmund started playing dirty? 

Shocking that they end the game with 11 men.",Feel like there were actually some decent individual performances in there. Just need more cohesion and everyone fully fit.,"![gif](giphy|L333C0OuANUA9v9UPn)

Lessgo",SHOOOOT,Just fuck off,Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,It’s crazy how much money we spend to be so shit lol. Outplayed by relegation fodder,Worse than I hoped. Better than expected,"""Gary O'Neil, who lost all but one of his games as a player against Chelsea, even the exception being a loss when he came off""

lmao","Sterling, Kai, and Auba are the worst starting attack in the Prem. 0 creativity, no chances created, can't even string passes together ever. It's a joke. 

Every game we wait for the subs to spark the attack. Maybe start some of the subs instead of the absolute wank we start every fucking game. Just awful all around. Potter must be blind","We don’t defend, we don’t create. What the fuck does this team do during the week besides run around and do cardio",Brighton playing out of pure hatred worked wonders for them.,People going after Kepa are being ridiculous,"Kepa with another great performance.

Pulisic needs to start over Havertz.","This might be the only game of the year where I legitimately don't care about the result. We played well, kept fighting, created, and it easily could have ended in a different result. In the end we're out of the energy drink cup and I couldn't care less, if anything it'll be nice to have some rest. I basically never feel positive after a loss, but genuinely feel we can take positives from that game and feel better after it than before.",One of the things I loved about Zakaria’s debut was that Jorgi looked more willing to move in to some smart pockets of space and play quicker forward balls. Seemed like he felt comfortable taking risks knowing he wasn’t the last man this time.,The left back of Dinamo with the Cucurella hair had every single player in his pocket today.,Fuck Simic,I like how Fofana is always the most eager to celebrate any Chelsea goals.,"Never seen such an ovation for the opposition as Costa got - what a player.


Blues played well, too.",Does anyone remember when we used to score goals?,Best they've looked since like January,"2011-12 / Fire coach, win champions league

2022-23 / Fire coach...","We looked like shit, oh wait. Are we still kissing ass to Potter? He's great, team looks good, give him 10 more years. What a joke of a manager we have.....anyone watched the post game, what was the excuse, too many days off? Not enough money spent? Did he actually take responsibility....",Petition for Broja to start on Saturday against West Ham. Lad looked good when he was on.,Mendy needs to hold the bench. Broja needs to start. That’s the main things I see,"Take a bow, Kepa. What a performance.","Today's my birthday.

They don't want to disappoint me.","What a performance we outclassed our opponent in every manner, Kai and Sterling chances should have wrapped this away but nevertheless the corruption has to stop dragging down by the hair is unacceptable",If I was Puli/Ziyech/Cho I'd be feeling pretty alienated by TT. Won't play them when the front 3 aren't clicking and when he does it way out of position. Who can blame them wanting to leave?
5,"Chelsea - no goals in 344 minutes.

Boehly has announced he is keeping Potter. He also announced we are ditching Three as our sponsor and changing to Zero next season.",Kai Havertz had an absolute blinder. Definition of a big game player,Fofana is so fucking good man.,First time Southampton have kept a CS since October.,"If we keep improving, I can see us maybe scoring a goal next leg.",Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,"We are fucked until 🌶 can play an entire 90. Cucurella can’t play the ball forward and doesn’t want to. He sure as hell can’t play defense either. The moment his boot touches the ball, any semblance of an attack dies. He can’t even play with his body in a position to be positive, his back is ALWAYS facing the opponents goal and he is always looking for his next move back towards ours.",New signings looked good,It took Felix 5 minutes to establish himself as our best attacker...,"this team is so hopeless, just depressing",Benfica telling Enzo that he wont play Champions football if he joins us is incorrect. He also wont play Europa football at this point,Zakaria needs to start every game full stop,I haven’t seen anyone say anything about Havertz yet. I thought he really shined this game!,Brighton laughing all the way to the fucking bank with that Cucurella deal,The most baffling thing is we can’t beat the press anymore period. Teams wait until we pass to our wide cb or wb and then we either turn it over or hoof it up field to their defenders. What the hell are we trying to do?,Potter got it terribly wrong. No idea why he didn’t make a change after the early goals like he did when his system clearly wasn’t working against United. Humiliating defeat for him,"Such a heartbreaking tie. Game changed with our subs though. The Kova sub was massive, and Pulisic and Broja played great.",Kepa Arrizabalaga.,We either create absolutely nothing during the game or create plenty and end up taking none of them. There's no in-between with this squad.,Champions League games and injuries man…,"Recall lukaku. At least make him miserable, too",Trevor immortal again,"What's this? A No.9 scoring an instinctive goal without even looking, and a midfielder scoring from outside the box? What a treat. Palace really stifled us, and our general play is improving, but we really got to pick up the pace.",3 goals but none from defenders? Wtf is this??,And they score on their only chance as per usual. With 5 subs I think LWB should be a sub we make every match,"Kepa and RLC deserve to keep their place moving forward.

Good to see Potter was able to make changes that affected the game. The Pulisic and Gallagher change in particular was really good. Think it would be good to see some more of those two.

I think people will say Havertz had a bad game, but his hold up was pretty good, considering he's not a striker. Thought he did well to bring others into play, for the most part.

Felix was electric again, just needs to be more clinical.

The difference between having Reece and Chilly and not.. Absolutely night and day. It's incredible, and something that needs addressing - we can't expect them to play every minute.

Enzo was quite good - the goal really showed how badly we need a true dm playing with him, someone who will cut that run down before it happens.

Koulibaly was shaky for the first 5 minutes, but really impressed me today. Pleasant surprise.

Mudryk wasn't so good. He's incredibly quick, and direct, but I think he actually needs to slow down a half step.

Already badly weakened by injuries and then further depleted by injuries to Sterling and Pulisic, the team gave an excellent account of itself against elite opposition.

We still look incapable of that final pass, but generally, I thought we looked more creative, organised, and hungry.

From there, we can build.",Please be ok Reece,"Said it in the game thread we’ve spent close to a billion on players in the last couple of years and our best player is a 38 year old man. Says everything about where this club is.

I miss this team having characters and leaders. Arsenal used to be our pets. We are out there pussyfooting around, nobody fighting.

Come give me a kiss,Potter wingardium leviosa’d us to the top of the group,do you guys think potter will be able to guide us to our third championship title?,This is gonna be a long season.,"Some thoughts:

Mendy is having a hell of a tough time out there, while I'm not the biggest believer in Kepa he needs a game to provide some much needed competition against Mendy.

Pulisic and Sterling were doing everything they could to make some plays down the center (dropping down for the ball, making runs into spaces in the center) but we have no one looking to make those passes. Since we are a non threat down the center, we become so much easier to defend. However, another plus is that both Pulisic and Sterling were getting passed their man but they have no outlets and in Pulisics case he reacts slowly to good goal scoring opportunities.

Broja still need some polishing but my god what a difference his presence makes on the pitch. I hope he and PEA can keep threatening/occupying the oppositions defense. Also, Kai seems to have better positioning (and dare I say confidence) when there is a proper striker on.

I love our wingbacks James, Cucurella, and Chilwell and I support playing through them but they are carrying entirely too much of our offensive load. Which again makes us predictable and defendable. So happy for Chilwell and elated to see him come on to make a difference, TT needs to give him a a few starts.

I'm most dissapointed in our midfield, Kovacic doesn't seem to be fit enough (he's still battling through some lingering injuries), Gallagher is still trying to find his place in the system but appears to be working hard, and while RLC has had some decent moments this season (not so much this game) he is just a huge momentum killer, maybe even more so than Jorginho.

Our defence looked fine. Thiago Silva is IMMENSE, Fofana had a good debut, and while KK hasn't been at his best he still does enough to do his job. 

We got lucky to get a favorable VAR call but this team needs to drastically improve to get a top position in order to secure some European football next season.","I like that Potter tried some new things with the formation and was equally quick to change it throughout the game. Sterling’s RWB foray to start the game incredibly brief, when it looked shaky. Cucerella looked super uncomfortable at LCB so Koulibaly came on in his place and helped sure up the defense. 

I mean you don’t often see double changes at half time for teams in the lead, espcially not one’s that involve defenders. But the team needed them, Potter made them and we were the better for it.",This game is not good for my health,whats the point of watching football? like whats the point? so i can watch blatant corrupt bastard refs decide every game?,"Above all else, it seemed our players were surprised that Leeds would press like they did.

Today was a collective failure from everyone involved."

EDIT: Cup game",Chilwell and Cucurella were insane,"Badi was a steal, what a player he is","Posted this in the lineup thread 

“We can’t rest anyone, Southampton have won more games than us in the last 20 games.

We are fucking bad! 4 wins in 20 games, looking like a relegation club. A loss here puts us in shambles, so no one is rested. The best 11 has to play and we have to win. Potter doesn’t last the summer if we lose or even draw this game.”","I thought everyone played fairly well, 2 posts and 2 amazing saves by Korbel. Super unlucky result, could have been 4-1.","Fair to say we looked like a team of players who have never played together. Shame Fofana didn’t spot Havertz as that should’ve/would’ve won it for us but good to see some of our injured players coming back. 

Reece was clearly taking it easy in the first half and understandably so but he needs to be careful he isn’t too cautious and inadvertently hurts himself again doing so",I’m just happy Enzo looks amazing and we don’t have another expensive flop stinking it up out there.

Mudryk looked electric for his cameo

Jorghino and silva with a experienced performance 


Looking forward for Felix and Mudryk to link up","Chukwuemeka has to start next game. 

Not going to bother commenting on anything else.","There won't be a single positive comment in here for weeks. Warranted, to be honest. Shit decisions lead to shit results","I can't believe how poor Koulibaly is. Before he joined us he was considered one of the best defenders in Serie A.

I keep saying Mount and Puli have our best link up play and they keep proving it. All in all very nice, kind of fizzled out toward the end though","The very, very, VERY fucking least you can do when you’re playing absolutely fucking shit is show some fucking desire, passion, some fight and grit and don’t go down without a fight. We did none of that. Just laid down and took the beating like good little boys.  Absolutely lucky to only lose 1-0. 

These players should be fucking ashamed of themselves. No they won’t learn their lesson. If they didn’t fucking wake up after the Brighton result, nothing will wake them up.","It feels like the managers have been so set on playing ""their"" system that the players never get to play to their strengths. So many players out of position and tend to play poorly there. 

It just ends up being a mishmash of players with no chemistry and no direction.

Maybe I'm just talking out of my ass but that's how I feel watching the team play.",At times i wish i was someone who didnt like sports.,Why was Chilwell marking 2 players alone at the far post?

But lets be honest they scored two terrible goals and their keeper was on fire. Hall looked good. Disappointed not to see Hutchinson come on.",Good performance ruined by another injury. Good debut from Zakaria - needs to work on his positioning. Chilly probably out for a couple of weeks. On the bright side this might be the first time we have Reece and Chilly playing in January but gutted if they can’t go to the World Cup which looks likely. Finishing has to improve. Puli could have had 2 assist to Conor at the end and probably should have had one. Broja has to pick up his head and be able to play a pass in order to ever play consistently. Would be amazing speed to have in attack.,"On the bright side, Real Madrid lost to Sheriff Tiraspol, who are worse than Zagreb, last season and won the UCL.","A much improved performance!! Delighted with it.

Something needs to change quickly but god knows what.,Biggest improvement was the quality of handshake Tuchel gave at the end,kai broja sterling front 3 next game please,Kepa MOTM for me. Don't go into the half with a lead without his heroics,"
Poor first half from sterling, Second half exactly why we signed him. Love it. 

Havertz might not be doing well in Terms of attacking but he’s turning into a proper shithouse",Anthony Taylor is dumber than I tell people,"A few thoughts. 

Attack: As many others have rightfully pointed out, our attack is extremely toothless. Don't quite understand how Havertz keeps getting a pass but I hope after these last 3 games we see some rotations. Same goes for Mount who imo is not playing his best position. 

Midfield: I believe our biggest problems are here. With Kante and/or Kovacic out our midfield is quite terrible. Jorginho isn't the player he once was and his defensive capabilities are hard to watch. 

Defense: Surprisingly enough, our defence isn't necessarily that bad. Admittedly Koulibaly had a bad game (some real bone-headed plays) but our biggest problem here is compromising Reece James potential by not using him as a proper RWB. Not sure if Fofana would fix our problems but he wouldn't hurt it. 

Leeds: Credit to Leeds who played with a lot of energy. They really disturbed the calm our team tends to have when distributing the ball. I'll be genuinely surprised if they can keep that type of energy and pressure all season. 

Was a hard game to watch and there definitely needs to be some discussion about TT's choices after a poor start to this season. Also, while the ref had some questionable calls (or lack thereof) I don't believe theres much blame there. Our players had a bad outing and didn't put in the performance they should have."
9,The worst is that I don’t feel anything watching us anymore. Like I’ve emotionally detached myself from how shit we are.,"Graham Potter has still a long way to go to prove he’s the right man for Chelsea but today has been a step in the right direction. Aside from that, today he was seen giving instructions to his players, hyping up the crowd and the players were all hugging and celebrating with him at FT. I don’t think there’s any merit in claims his personality is not good enough for Chelsea.

Cucurella, Havertz outstanding. You can see why Pep wanted Cucu","Wes Fofana is fucking immense. Him and Badi together for the next 10 years wow

Proper 6 pointer game right there. Gotta beat the other relegation candidates around us","Pathetic performance.

If we're to trust a process, we should see a process. All I've seen is a process of regression.

Wasn't Potter out before but he just isn't cut out for a team like Chelsea. I'd be happy seeing him gone in the morning tbh. 

Genuinely not sure how anyone can justify that performance or put it all on the players.","How tf did we lose that match 1-0???? Haven’t seen our offense flow that well in ages, but goal line clearances, two posts, and some crazy saves, and some weird reffing.. in another world we blow out Dortmund with the same performance", Obligatory “squad needs to gel”,Palace was a lucky win let's be honest. We can't win matches. It can't be that difficult especially against a pretty bad West Ham.....,"Mudryk looked good. Badiashile looked good again. Things starting to look positive under Potter

Hall and Carney showed plenty of the bench and Zakaria was a wall in midfield.",Simon Hooper could be a great bloke but he's a twat of a ref,I prefer really not to speak,"Absolutely soulless. Not even toxic, soulless","The only brightside today is that it proved we are right to poach Brighton's higher ups, even if it it's unfair on them.

They have the best recruitment in the league. Bar none. They sign unknown players for cheap who have clearly been scouted down the minute details, and they *know* these players are going to fit the system. Bissouma, Trossard, MacAllister, Mitoma... the list goes on a lot longer than that. Theyre just the players off the top of my head who have/had looked world class for Brighton, despite being relatively unknown before joining.

It's exactly the opposite of what we've done for the last 7 or 8 years. Signing players based off their name as opposed to how they play. Not just us, but if you go through the list of the top 20 highest transfer fees of all time, 75% of them were flops or underwhelming. These people in charge of Brighton's transfers are absolutely outstanding at what they do, and, if we can get him in, I'm excited to see what structure Winstanley can put in over the next few years.

Also, I guess Kai scoring was nice too.

Other than that, it was obviously pretty shit. But I'll cut Potter and the squad some slack. It's an insane season with the number of games, and the end of the day, they're all only human. We were in Salzburg on Tuesday, they had a week off. Results like this are going to happen throughout the season for every team.

Edit: I even keep an eye on Brightons U23 side cause there's a young lad in their team from my hometown in Ireland, he's only 17 and banging the goals in for them. They're U23 side is incredibly talented too.","
Those of you calling that on Kepa at the end, shame on you.

If it had deflected at any angle further outside of the post you’d be noshing him off.","As frustrating as it was, they were really well organized. We put them in quite a few bad spots over the last 20 but they always had cover and didn't make a mistake until the very end.",We had the better chances.,"First it was James and now Chilwell...just like last season, FML!

Every Chelsea attacker",It had to be Gallagher,"I am really enjoying the performances under Potter so far. There's definitely going to be tougher matches, I mean we've played Salzburg, a half injured Milan and a Wolves who look in real trouble. BUT, these have been games we've struggled with before so being able to take 3-0 back to back is excellent.

Mason and Gallagher are pressing machines but more than that I saw they were much more confident today. The touches, the lay offs, passing, crossing everything was much more crisp than in the last couple of weeks/months.

Big shout out for Koulibaly. He's been rocky at the start of the season but seems to be settling. Some lovely crunchy tackles today as well.

I'm happy we are starting to move away from defenders FC. While it was fun, I prefer to see our attackers actually do their jobs!

Finally, being able to rotate as much as we did and still pick up a 3-0 win is phenomenal. If this is a sign of things to come well bring me aboard the Potter train!

![gif](giphy|ZKy1xVpbQNjRH6NsBU|downsized)","Ends with a bad taste in our mouth, but I’m a lot more positive about that game than most. That was the best I’ve seen us play all year outside of the Tottenham game. Not the flashiest first game for Potter, but a great step forward.

Sterling is our best non-defender. He was fantastic. Mount looked good most of the time. Probably his best performance all year. Havertz has made no improvement from his other starts, unimpressive, lost the ball too much, killed a lot of our chances. Broja brought a ton of energy in the final 3rd, that one miss is going to haunt him. Gallagher was okay, if uninspiring.

Can’t comment on Pulisic, he was fine, just subbed on too late to make an impact. Ziyech however, despite being subbed in just as late, actively worsened every aspect of the team. His last two performances have been just horrific. I’m not giving up on him yet, but he really needs to step it up immediately.

This game after we scored: 💀","Three things: 

1. Chilwell HAS to start! Game changed completely when he came on.

Really solid performance from Ruben, if he can keep those up I can't see him being dropped often. Mason however needs to shape up. He's been awful this entire season, completely invisible today.

Reece James continuing to show he's our best attacker. Silva continuing to show that despite being ancient, he is out best defender. 

I hope people can see why we are bringin in Fofana though. Chalobah is far too hot and cold. For everything great he does, he does something stupid. Also the fact that we are relying on Azpi if we get 1 CB injury (without Fofana). 

Considering we had 10 men, I will absolutely be taking that.",[removed],"I know people get upset when this is brought up,  but if 5+ different attackers haven't been performing over 2+ seasons, at some point it's on the manager.

Despite that, I tried to give Potter a chance and give him the benefit of the doubt. 

I made excuses for the results with injuries etc. Not any more. I've been watching Chelsea for over thirty years and this all just feels wrong. The results and performances are just too bad. Since we lost to Fulham away it's gone from bad to worse.

I can't warm to Potter or his staff. It's clear to everyone that something is not right.

Hall, Kovacic, Ziyech, and Cucurella all played well. 
Pulsic had a decent game too but he needs to convert those chances to cement his place. 

Again, do not bother about this game. 

But Potter should see the difference when he doesn't play RLC in midfield and also at RWB Azpi in 15 minutes cameo looks more energetic.",So many times in recent years can’t even think about the win after a serious injury. This one is a dead rubber too so extra sting,"I know everyone was atrocious, but just leave Ziyech in Zagreb, man…","Very good win

Should have taken easier chances

But good to see Kai and Puli gaining some confidence back",Fuck me I aged by about 97 years watching this,"One man who goes unnoticed is Kepa. Doesn't have a lot to do because of our good defence. But when he is needed, he steps up!!

Kepa redemption underway!!","Last 10 minutes we decided to go exclusively down the right side, that had Zyiech on it…..","Great win, brilliant performance but my god AC Milan fans made us sound like the away side","Mount and Jorginho were head and shoulders above the rest today. Silva of course is always good, that's his default.",,"Lavia with his first senior goal for Southampton.

Adam Armstrong with his first goal in almost a year.

Southampton with only 1 home win in 8 prior to this game.

CHARITY FC ARE BACK!",The formation in the first half really suited Pulisic. But like Sterling with no striker he had no real passing options except out wide.,Kepa MOTM,"Great fight and spirit after the red, and great performance from Vardy for us today - MOTM in my mind.",State of the fucking refereeing in that match,"I was at the game today, never seen Chelsea play so bad in my life. They looked clueless playing tippy tappy balls that lead to nothing while Leeds play a through ball and cause havoc against a 3 man defence. Gallagher looked out of his depth and Jorginho was nowhere to be seen. Id have at least kept one of them on instead he goes all out fifa style and swaps them for wingers. Crazy game"
11,"How much do we need to see before they admit they made a mistake?

Say what you want about a long term project, a process, but I do not want someone leading a long term project who can not set this team up to score a goal in 3 games. We've lost to the worst team in the league, we're not showing up against one of our biggest rivals, the players look disinterested, we're never threatening. We've scored 1 fucking goal this month. Not a single player has shown any sign of improvement under this staff.

We came out of the tunnel at half and immediately conceded.

Do we literally have to wait until we're actually fighting for relegation before we acknowledge this? Laugh all you want, but we are playing at a relegation pace right now and are closer to that than the top 4. We have 2 wins in the last 16. I don’t want to hear shit about giving him time, the clown has been here for 6 months and we’re getting worse with time and squad reinforcements. 

We can’t score goals and we have a veteran with 300 on the bench who can only get 10 minutes of game time when we’re down 2? I’m not saying he is the solution but that train of thought shows some glaring issues doesn’t it? The only chances we create is Felix sending a bullet to the keeper's chest. Somehow we have managed to make one of the best defenders in the world in Reece James invisible.

He has to do better with this squad, we have world class players in this club. I'm not expecting perfection but there has to be SOME positive signs. We could be heading into a stretch without Thiago Silva. That is the worst player this club can afford to lose right now. He was like having flex tape on a leaky water pipe doing everything he could to hold this together.

The man we sacked for this clown had more passion than this entire club from top to bottom the last time we played Spurs. Cannot wait to hear his post game comments delivered with the passion of a retired librarian talking about fortnite. Fuck this shit.

Todd you have gloriously fucked up and you are too ashamed to admit you’ve made a mistake and it will continuously drive this club to be worse. The money you’re throwing around doesn’t do shit if you have no idea what you’re doing with it.

TLDR: I am pissed and rambling nonsense. I miss Tuchel.",So many fantastic individual performances!!,Unbeaten in March 😤,I’m steaming mad. Potter looked bewildered.,We were not shit. We showed fight and promise. The match was exciting and the players gave everything. We will murder them in the second leg,"Someone called Badhiashile, ""The Shield"" on the match thread and I absolutely loved that name. We got good player on him.",This subreddit being a dumpster fire every week except on UCL nights reminds me of Lampard days 😂,"Lots of positives to take from this game:         
-Badiashile has solidified himself as a starter in this side.          
-Mudryk was formidable for someone who hasn’t played in months.         
-Ziyech is on form.         
-Havertz was somewhat better today playing with ziyech. Let’s see how he plays with ziyech, mudryk and felix next to him.","Havertz getting all the hate, but goddamnit where are the hates toward Azpi, Kova,  Chalobah and even Mount?

Compared to them he was miles better tbh. Azpi and Kova were casually giving the ball away. I genuinely forgot Mount was playing until the got the yellow 

As for Chalobah, the less we say the better..",We’ll get them in the 2nd leg.,Disappointed in Potter after this result. It was clear 5 mins into the second half that something needed to change and he waited another 15 minutes. Upsetting because the first half looked promising.,"Considering how much the 2 early injuries must have changed our approach, Think we played relatively alright tonight, just wish we had a finisher with consistent goals in them.

Props to Zakaria too.",Simon Hooper doing his best Anthony Taylor impression,The most passion all game was chasing after a ball that went out of bounds,Gotten to the point where losses don’t even ruin my day. We are firmly midtable.,"The defeat was long coming if we are being honest, we have been terrible in the PL for all games except for wolves.. something needs to change, the structure,  play style something","We didn’t looked like we deserved a win anyway. Without Kepa, we could be 0-3 by half time. 1-1 is a fair result.","Starting lineup was wrong from Potter today imo. Puli should have started ahead of Kai. There was no one to really try and break the lines against and resolute Brentford defence today, except Puli when he came on who looked very sharp.

Ultimately it seemed like no team deserved the 3 points today but I do hope we start Puli against United with Auba up front and Sterling/Mason.

Broja looked ok today, but he needs to show more, especially during these spells of high confidence.",I for one am not upset at all. Less matches is a good thing at this point. Just focus on Champions League and top 4.,"People need to stfu about Potter not resting a particular player, or blaming him for Chilwells injury. He made 7 changes from last game, that's a fuckload.  
Chilwell has been playing fuck all lately and he needed the 90 minutes to improve his fitness and sharpness. That's not on Potter whatsoever, regardless of how supposedly unimportant this game was.",No point looking at Individual players when it's all of them.,"Thiago Silva giving everyone a series of heart attacks for various reasons... Falling on his neck, giving the ball away for the first time of his match... Never stops being class regardless!",Shoutout to Fofana for recovering from a couple early mistakes to put in a strong performance. Shoutout to Pulisic and Gallagher for their impact in the midst of all the incessant hate from so many Chelsea “supporters”,"If I had to sum that up. I would just say, what a great fun match to watch.

Also. People comparing Trent to Reece.

They might have to compare him to Azpi after today. My god he was great going forward today!","1 point from two games from the easiest opponents of our group.

Now it's back to back games against Milan and we may be out of the group stage by the time we play Salzburg again.","I run out of words for Reece James. Special, special player",One more win seals the group for us ya?,,"Fuck. Just dire, absolutely dire.",Think Pulisic + Sterling could create a lot playing off an actual striker. Genuinely not sure what Gallagher’s role was supposed to be today,"Kepa MOTM imo

Without his heroics (or if they’d been more lethal) that could’ve been an ugly score line. Got very lucky that their players made two crucial errors for our goals cause outside of those we were pretty impotent

Important part is we got the 3 points.",Absolute top tier shit housery from Havertz,"Positives: we absolutely bossed them the whole game. RLC looked really tidy at RWB. Feels a bit like a loss because of the late equaliser, but anyone with eyeballs can see we were the better team. Kante had a blinder and I hope his injury isn't too serious. 

Negatives: Refereeing. Anthony Taylor and Mike Dean are legitimately corrupt and/or dangerously incompetent. If I fucked up that bad at work, I'd get the sack. Useless cunts.","Hopefully today is the day it changes.

Sit down with your coaches Tommy, decide what you want to do going forward, then take that information to the people upstairs and lay out the plans.

We either play a back 3 or a back 4, no back 4, back 3, front 4, front 2, front 6 mid games and different every week, lets build a base again. 

Then get people into fit that system. Build from there. 

Lets start fixing problems instead of papering over them. Too much of that seems to have been happening, if players can't play the system the coach wants, they are benched or moved on, simple.

Personally i hope we get Fofana in and Tuchel continues the back 3. Cucuerlla LCB, Kalid CB, Fofana RCB and Chilly and James flying outwide should give us very good control. 

Upfront we just need a striker someone to fit the system we want, Kai aint it and you waste Sterling when you play him through the middle."
12,"It’s not even that Spurs played well. We just played awful. Progressively getting worse by the week. Can’t even identify what the plan is right now. Joao wins goal of the month since it was the only goal that we scored this month. 

If you asked the Spurs players, this was probably the easiest game they have played all season. Conte not even on the touch line and a backup keeper.",kai played so well,I SLEPT THROUGH OUR FIRST GOAL IN YEARS NOOOOOOOO,Anyone know a twitter discussion or after match podcast I can listen to? Got a drive ahead of me,"Such an unfortunate result, and their goal was a bit suspect considering the sideline official had his offside flag raised which caused slight hesitation in our players decision making.

Just bullshit for us to not to pop them for 2 or 3. The second Joao chance that rang the crossbar hurt me so bad. He deserved a goal for the wonderful performance he put in. Koulibaly had a major redemption game. I thought Enzo was phenomenal and that strike at the end was emphatic.

At first I wasn't liking the Ziyech/RLC defensive positioning in the first 15-20 minutes and felt like Dortmund were walking into our attacking third on a whim, but they settled down and bossed the second half. Ziyech especially played like a man possessed.

I just can't find it in me to feel too upset, we deserved this one. We played so well. We're only 1 goal down. I am so excited to see where we're at in 3 weeks time when we see them again. 

Kante possibly back? Kovacic back fully fit? Possibly Sterling or Pulisic as more wide options? 

We're taking this second leg, I trust in Potter.",2 goals in our last 6 matches 😂,"Terrible penalty decision aside, that's now 2 wins from our last 14 PL games. 

The excuses are running dry. Potter is lucky to be in a job with this kinda run.","Recap:

I’m on the verge of a breakdown.,"If we win against Fulham, we're equal on points with them.  
I cannot believe I had to type that...",I won’t talk about any negatives today. I loved watching us today and that’s enough for me. And we won too.,Buckle up - this is going to be a long rebuild. Not once did I think we’d score in that game.,Newcastle are dirty bastards but we deserved to lose. Have to wonder what we work on in training as we look absolutely clueless with and without the ball.,Forcing a back 3 will continue to do this. Why not just sacrifice one position on the back four instead of sacrificing 4/5 positions in the rest of the team??,"Need to see more love for Chalobah. He’s not the big name everyone wants, but he’s been immense so far this season, just gets better every game he plays. Give me him over Gvardiol any day.",How was there not a single card in that match? Blows my mind,"I’m either seeing Pulisic was good outside of his finishing, or Pulisic should be put to death at the first light. No in between.",[deleted],You know you are in trouble when an out of form Havertz looks like your best attack. Mount and Ziyech are absolutely shocking.,"We’re guaranteed through, right?",Almost got that boring 2-0 game that the guy was hoping for. Maybe next week.,What a rise from Conor Gallagher. He literally bossed that flank all game. Never absent in defense either. Finally starting to see his quality on the pitch.,At least we played progressive football the entire game. The players look excited again,I don’t wanna hear no RLC slander tonight!!!!,I thought they 4 lines of coke the ref took first half ran it course. But it looked like he took another quick bump by the ending of the second half,,"Honestly pay Frenkie what ever he wants. Jorginho has been figured out. 

Please start Broja , Kai needs to sit down a bit. 

Ziyech looked so good for 10 minutes then went offline for the other 80 why was he still on the pitch. 

Our defense is individually great but so many damn blunders with positioning. No one covering for both goals we conceded. 

Honestly too many issues to fix. I can't see us in 4th if Tuchel doesn't figure out how to bring the best out of these players. It will be a tough season to watch.",Benjamin James Chilwell.,"We got incredibly lucky there. Had no real control of the game and very few good chances. Really need to do better because results like this are rare in game where we perform like that. 

On a positive note, though, Kepa was absolutely monstrous. I've been hyper-critical of Kepa, but god damn, I don't think I've ever seen him pull off a game like that. The Ben Roberts effect and marriage buff combo is doing Kepa a world of good.",Never the easy way,How the fuck is that hair pull not a foul,Disastrous performance. A system/style change is immediately required. We pose absolutely no goal threat at all and we haven't for quite a while.
13,"Chillwell and James went from being the most threatening dynamic wing back duo in the world, to having zero involvement as fullbacks. Potter has to take the blame there for that.

The front line has to be Mudryk Havertz Sterling and Felix moving forward. The team needs to be more decisive in their attack. They have a skill advantage, but dony use it with the back passes and slowing down of the game. Whenever the team plays quick passes and varies the ball from outside and inside you see good opportunities created.

Mount first off the bench as he still provides a spark. Substitutions also need to be made at a time they can still impact the game.

RLC and Ziyech do not do enough for the team. Those two and Auba should not be getting any meaningful minutes.",bellingham is just 6 foot andros townsend,"As a long time lurker posting for the first time, I'm talking about both my post and the result when I say it had to start somewhere. We may have scraped a win over a relegation bound Leeds shutting up shop to protect a 1-0 lead with some strange substitutions, but we had to stop the rot in whatever way we could. The manager situation is up to the owners, as a team I hope we build on this to hopefully bring a bit of respectability to our season. Fofana has been excellent since he's come back and it was great to see Chilwell play the full 90 with legs to sprint back right at the end. 3atb with him and Reece is the way forward. Let's rattle Dortmund on Wednesday!","Said it in my prediction Southampton were guaranteed at least a point today after that lineup leaked and my god how far we've fallen. There's absolutely no excuse for losing here, none. Drop your excuses and admit we're  fucked under Potter. Things could improve but this manager has a ceiling and it's not managing a world class team. We're just wasting our own time here.",Best performance for ages by a fucking mile. And it was still a loss. Hope they take enough from that performance for this to be a turning point.,Gallagher should absolutely not give corners anymore.,"Potter is lucky that Tuchel got us 10 points at the start of the season, because we would be in a relegation fight if he hadn't.",Still a work in progress but plenty of signs to be optimistic.,"Hé came, he peaked, hè stagnated, and then he got taken out of the game.

Game was actually pretty good, we were unlucky not to score and the city goal was an unfortunate mistake.
Looking forward to seing more of the young players, they are rekindling my hope for the future (not this season tho hahaa this season is donzo).","Structure was much better with Zakaria. I don’t think he’s a world beater, but he is what we need deep in midfield at the moment.

Night and day difference once James came off. I hope it’s very minor. Wouldn’t mind a new RB in Jan.","The lack of chances created after going 1-0 down is concerning. 

I know it's early days for Potter, and the decision's irreversible obviously but... I feel like we're hardly any better than we were under Tuchel towards the end of his time in charge.","I wanna know why Kova's footballing abilities gets reduced by 75% as soon as he is in the final third.. sometimes he is like Hazard driving the team up, then as soon as he steps into the final third he turns into Elneny...","One of the most pathetic first halves I've ever witnessed.

No idea what Potter will have to say that can excuse that, it was entirely predictable that Brighton would fly out of the gates.

Not all terrible, as the game went on, but wastefulness with chances is going to really cost us as the season goes on.","RLC spacial awareness is so poor. Absolute liability in midfield in tight games like this. Let his runners go all game too down that side. Credit to Jorginho and Kova for covering his workload.

Draw a fair result but missed opportunity.",Weird how that Mee first half tackle and that handball were just barely looked at,"We created 1.93 xG compared to 1.63 for City. Overall a fine performance, where we just couldn't finish. Should have played Omari Hutchinson in this. With the insane schedule we will have post-WC, I'm fine with an exit here.",Me watching Zakaria is like the scene in Avengers Infinity War when Okoye sees Scarlett Witch and is like “Why was she up there all this time?”,The beauty of this post match thread is that it could’ve been made at halftime. This team is beyond inept at attacking,"We have to have the most frustrating attackers ever. They all show their quality in bursts, but never at the same time, and never for long lol Also, the undercutting shit needs to be punished with a yellow. Kane does that shit all the time and gets away with it, but it can seriously mess someone up if they land wrong.","Thank you Conor!!!!!!!!

We played ""ok"" no where near amazing, but not as bad as we have been playing is the only positives i can take personally as an overall take.

Reece James though fuck me, guy is best player on the planet!! Man handled Zaha so much he forced him to go to the left hand side where he hates playing lol.","I was sad to see tuchel go but this team is looking night and day. It felt like a matter of time until we scored from very early on. Intensity and directness being noticeable differences.The fact we can rest half our first team and still play like this is encouraging. 

Azpi massive improvements on his early season form. Mase back on it, puli and havertz getting much needed goals. Broja debut goal. Gallagher's confidence from the goal last week was evident. No injuries. Another clean sheet.

A dream game all round really.",ziyech came on and played another 1/10,"Such an amazing feeling knowing your team is just cruising to victory. Missed that. 

Great performances all around tonight but of course Thiago Silva being motm again for the umpteenth time. The man oozes class.","Didn’t believe a few weeks ago we’d do the double over Milan. Incredible.

Also a lot of people showing they don’t know the laws of the game with that Tomori red",,Man City trail 2-0 they come back and score 4 in the second half. We are level 1-1 with 60 minutes and these players lose it,"It’s not a victory I’m proud of, but it is much needed. We need results but fuck me we need to change our playing style, because it’s horrid","Havertz is such an annoying player. He never seems to take a step forward after a good game, the next game is almost always poor. I think if Nkunku does come in it's game over for Havertz. I don't see how we could possibly continue with him, especially when you see someone like Gallagher come in and play so well.

On more positive note, thoroughly enjoying the Kepa redemption, long may it continue. Finally Mason up to speed as well, love watching those turns, guy has such excellent poise and balance.",Unclenching in 3.2. 1 and ahhhhh,"Happy with how we played. Tottenham scored both goals after clear and obvious fouls. At what point does the officiating staff get fined, penalized, dropped? Why do we have VAR? PL is going the way of the NBA, absolute horseshit officiating making the game impossible to watch.","I don't really know why anyone is surprised this is just a continuation of last seasons form. This team's key problem is we cannot score period. We only score if our pressing causes a mistake or through set pieces. 


We got away with it last season because our defenders almost always kept a clean sheet or conceded very few goals so we could get away with draws. Our defenders also consistently provided our attacking input as well. 


The problem now is our best midfielders are out, Reece James isn't playing his best position and Mendy is not the same. So now our backline has matched the ineptitude of our forwards. It was only a matter of time until we were exposed."
14,This can’t go on. Utterly insipid football,"So so many great performances!!

Instead of passing forward or throwing a long ball we play it to the side where our players are pressured and then have to pass it to the keeper. It’s the same thing EVERY SINGLE MATCH. Whether it’s kepa or Mendy, the ball always ends up at the keeper and our keeper is always under pressure. Clearly this doesn’t work so why do we keep doing it every single match?","We're just not very good.

Win, lose, Tuchel, Potter, first pre-season match or 12th game in the league, up 3-0 or down 3-1, we don't dominate opponents like we did many a time in seasons past, we create very little causing us to believe the players can't finish when we're just relying on scraps.

When we came 4th in 2019-20, we blamed Kepa for us not achieving more. This season, the only reason we're still in the top 4 race is because of Kepa. Sums it up really.",Sterlings spot has to be questioned. So sick of watching attacks waste chance after chance.,"Slightly under the radar but Kai Havertz has been awful recently, he loses the ball 90% of the time and just commits a load of pointless fouls high up the pitch",I'm just here to overreact.,"Nice to see this through. Standout performances for me today were from Mount, Havertz, Chilwell, Zakaria and J5. Kai link up was really good today, could've had 2 assists + 1 goal. Mount was super cool to watch with his quick turns and box to box presence. Same goes for Zakaria too, physically really dominant....with better positioning I think he can be really good. J5 was really great in trying to attempt progressive passes and breaking up play. Hope nothing serious going on with Chilwell man, will feel so fucking bad for him if it's something serious. Seemed like he was really getting back to his feet with today's performance, was a constant threat on the left.","Well it's obvious that:
- the 3-4-3 does not work anymore
- Ziech should leave
- Kova and Mount as a double pivot is a disaster
- Mount is not good enough defensively to play as a CM
- taking James from WB and putting him as CB is straight murder for our team
- Pulisic is the type of player who is only good on the RW/LW making runs behind the line (and on the counter, if we look at the type of players we had it seems that the team was going for this type of play in the past)
- Fofana and KK need more time
- Auba needs to shoot more often, Sterling faster and Mount less
- some players are very tired(and a lot of the blame is on Tuchel who insists that the players need to give 100% every game while nothing is working)
- some players don't want to be at Chelsea anymore
- the group morale during games falls very fast
- Tuchel is tired and uninspired","We cant lose with Chalobah man, guy is 100% guaranteed starter now","For a change our goals did not come for defense. That is progress, I guess.","Perfect outing today, players well, won, kept a clean sheet, Kai and Pulisic scored, mason assisted, broja debut goal, carney chukwuemeka debut and we've rested all the important players before Milan away game.

Fuck we needed that. Season looked like it might start spiraling after we went down 0-1.

Mendy has been consistently wank the past 6 months.",I hope that Thiago isn't injured..,"Thiago Silva is a fucking beast but feels like he is gonna get injured any moment due to age, especially towards the end of games.

Havertz still very disappointing as a goal threat but at least he did some defensive work today.","Look, disappointing at the end. Second corner shouldn't have stood after very clear foul on Cucurella by Romero - shouldn't even be a debate. But make no mistake, that is a very positive result and the way we played even better. I was seriously worried going into this game but I've come out very positive about this season and if we can add a couple more players in key areas then hopefully we can have a solid season. If anyone doubts Tuchel after this they need their head checked. The man is an elite manager and got it absolutely right today and his passion for the club is clear. Let's not let the last few minutes overshadow all the positives we had in that match. Onto the next one.","Disappointing is a small word for today.

We were embarrassed out of all teams Leeds?
They kept a clean sheet and score 3.

This is Tuchel's 2nd full season and yet I am not seeing any changes to the team.
We have already spent 175M and going to spend close to 300M and still, we are nowhere near to getting the 80 points Mark let alone winning the PL.

You look at City their recruitment is top-notch.
And our embarrassing we need rebuilding every 2nd years.

And for the match whoever is in charge of defending set pieces should be sacked.

And we need a DM for a long time yet we still play Jorginho who is more of a DLP than DM.

I am not Tuchel out I will see him go through a full season but he needs to change the system or gameplay.

We keep playing on the wings and leave the centre of the pitch empty one of the reasons we struggle to score goals and also the same reason other teams get spaced in the centre of the area.

Arsenal was very similar to us last season and before in terms of style but they get players who suit them and now so far they look good in every area on the pitch."
15,"Every player we’ve signed was fantastic in the first 1-2 games, then after being coached by Potter, they all look terrible.

Already can see the impact Mudryk will have. Getting some important players back and a favorable run of fixtures. Nice to see a sense of calmness in defense. Other than Jorgi the rest of the midfield was poor.

I’m sorry but Mounts contract negotiations will continue to drag on with these performances.","The only positive I see is we will not have a congested schedule next season which will help the manager (don’t know if that’s Potter) apply his football philosophy.

It’s a shame we are performing as poorly as we are. Yes, Potter deserves some blame but so do the players who play with no intensity, fluidity or passion. And so does the ownership for not really knowing how to approach this season with the sacking of Tuchel after signing the players he wanted. Add injuries to all that and it’s a recipe for disaster. 
I can only hope that Potter starts to figure things out towards the end so we at least have something to look forward to next season.","Misplacing easy passes, jogging on the pitch, not giving a fuck. Embarrassing",If you want to be like Arsenal take by their example and pay Auba to leave,Start Zakaria from now on.,Ref probably has Øverbø and Anthony Taylor posters on his house’s walls,Sterling and auba have been awful.

We've just been a ragtag of expensive players and promising youths for a while now, but never a good, solid squad.

Hopefully this new assembly of a technical director team can build our squad in the right direction with the right transfers.",Trevor MOTM i think not that anyone particularly stands out,"Pulisic, sterling, and mount need to play together - not be competing for the same spots. They all move off the ball well and create space that the other 2 can exploit, and they do well finding each other on the field (even if it doesn't come off, I'll take progressive intent over backwards passing).",I like the B Team more than the A Team .,"Poor Chilly. That’s his World Cup too. Bullshit

All I got from that game is that I pray we are once and for all done with shoehorning players into a back 3.

Didn’t like the line up from the start and I don’t like it even more now. Chilly picks up an injury that will surely put him out through the World Cup, Kouli and Azpi picked up knocks. Mase plays another full 90. 

Just terrible load management in such a tight schedule. Would have been a perfect game to send some youth out there not for the sake of having youth out there but to rest senior players. 

Who gives a shit if you drop points. Just stupid","They set a trap and we walked right into it. 

Fair play to Dinamo. We are fucking woeful. 

This is getting really really bad now.","Some of you people need to learn to control your emotions, imagine if I kicked the door down and abused you everytime you fucked up at work. Just be nice to at least our own players.",Kepa made us feel safe again.,A job well done. Biggest surprise of the evening is azpi without a doubt. Looks like he’s found his engine again. Such a sight to behold.,Well that was a sad goal to concede,You guys reckon Mendy will instantly comeback once he is fully recovered to starting 11? Kepa has been very solid and some good saves today. His ball distribution for me is better than Mendy,Great 1st half from Mount. Reminded us of the player he can be.,,"We would've lost 4-1 had it not been for Cucu and Silva today. Really take that in, losing 3-0 to Leeds and then this. We'll be lucky to end in the Europa League playing like this","We need to table any talk of contract extensions for Mendy. He's been pretty bad and looked very shaky for most of the year.

He got extremely lucky today, didn't feel like a foul to me.","Our worst performance under Potter

And we win 2-0.

I wasn’t sure about him at first but he’s doing everything right so far.","Crazy fucking match, glad the team showed spirit to push on and hold for the win. Can’t wait to see Kova and jorgi back together","Spurs and their fans celebrating a draw they didn’t deserve like they’ve won the World Cup lol they’ll always have the same small time mentality and they’ll win nothing this year like they do every year.

On to the next one, KTBFFH","Well that, was fucking dreadful. Not one positive to take from that. 0/10 performances from like most of the squad. Kai needs to be benched. Conor is not a solution in the double pivot.

Zakaria, Pulisic, Mount, Kai & Jorginho were great.

James was amazing. Hope he isn’t out for too long

Auba looked lost when he came on.","Someone smarter than me needs to explain why a midfield of Zakaria-Jorginho-Mount would've been worse than whatever the fuck we saw today, at some points Jorgi looked like our ONLY midfielder.

So many people were saying ""it was only Zagreb"" but we've literally seen this exact midfield not be enough all season, you know what we call this? Insanity.

More than that, we just lack SO much fight at the moment. It feels like we don't have a single player who will step up and be the impetus of the club.",All my homies want a 10th place finish,"Cucurella makes me miss Marcos Alonso and Emerson.

62M pissed down the drain.","Game of millimeters, both literally and figuratively",Not good enough for havertz. Don’t like him as one of those 10s. Rather have pulisic or Sterling there,"Good first half, rocky second. If KK could jump we'd only lost 1-0. Overall not a terrible performance. Lewis Hall is a baller. We can't even finish a sentence let alone a chance. Same old story. We are knackered, need the WC break, badly",Boehly needs to look at the medical/fitness/physio team at Chelsea something is terribly wrong with these amount of injuries.,"Have to admit, I do not see us reviving anything till after the World Cup (best case scenario), and the crazy schedule till then means we are likely to have done a lot of irreparable damage to the season by then. Also don't see Tuchel surviving this. Feels like half the team is just not playing for him and he himself seems out of ideas.","Havertz slander. Havertz banger to win it. I'm very happy about that. I thought he was good tonight. People need to realise his relaxed style =/= not caring or not doing well. If you actually *watch* him, you can see just how good he is. Had an unbelievable dribble at the end of the first half. However, he does need to do it more often to get to the next level. Same could be said about 95% of this team.

Qualified. Could be cemented top by the end of today. Amazing considering the start we had to the group.

Gallagher, Chalobah and Pulisic (for about 50 minutes) were great. Think Broja deserves to start more.

Tough game, great game to watch, and an outstanding win.",Substitutes came on and did what substitutes should do. Contribute. Let’s take the win and keep rolling.,"That goal between Mount and Puli was a fkn beauty. All you people that hate on that starting front 4 need to relax. Our starters can't play every game with this crazy schedule and if those guys can go out and get 3 points against bottom of the table teams they are doing their jobs.

B) Bald refs suck balls 

C) how good is having chelsea back","
Not Sterlings fault he’s played at wingback, or asked to play deep, but he is utterly useless outside of the final third. Can’t beat a man, can’t pick a pass, holds the ball forever in dangerous positions.  I’m sure it sucks coming from city and trying to play through our dysfunction, but he adds very little for us right now

Our midfield is nonexistent. RLC a complete passenger. Potter has to ration out Kovacic’s minutes like water on a lifeboat because he’s half-crocked. 

We need to spend serious money in January 

Also I know it didn’t lead to anything but that yellow for Azpilicueta is such a woeful decision I’m still incensed over it",Chalobah cannot pass a ball forward and neither can Mendy. Just a joke of a performance,"Long season ahead for all teams, keep faith in the Blues. On to the next one",Fucking joke they had 2 on1 for that header in the 94th. Where was the defence?

Potterball stock on the rise","Ziyech was bad, but it's wild that everyone talks only about him, when we whole first half and second half after our goal and before theirs we were completely uninspiring.

If anything I find it funny just how much has been thrown upon the club this season- the sale, the manager change, the massive injury list, the mid-season tournament, the divided fan base and so on. The thing is that even now I cannot say that I am pro or against Graham Potter as he doesn't have the players he wants, is missing half a squad and also came in at the drop of a hat and has had no time to fully implement his ideas... but fuck me we are turgid right now. Joao Felix was the only bright spark tonight. Oh and the only other possible positive over the last month or so? Well it looks like he's going to be out for some time now too. Football eh! FFS",We conceded 4 goals and I feel like the defence was the least problematic thing on the field. Insanely bad,Brighton lose Potter and they look better than us now. amazing,"Man City are just plain better than us so this result was expected.

That being said we looked so much better today than we did against Nottingham. We look to have a potentially good couple players in Chukwuemeka and Hall.

Some of the link up play and directness was something I haven't seen in a long time. 

Puli obviously had the bad flub at the end, but overall I thought he was a great spark and contributed a lot today. Would love to see him and Broja both start this weekend. 

Chalobah has been so solid and underrated this season so far. He had another excellent game.",That midfield triangle formed by the 10 and two in the pivot was terrible. I was hoping to see Pulisic start on the wing today.,"Everyone was great. Shoutout Azpi turning back the clock!

Potterball makes my balls tingle!","Kepa tax. I feel for the guy, has a good game but still concedes for no fault of his own.","This is exactly what we fucking needed.

Absolutely dominated the champs of Italy. Complete control, great chemistry, great fluid passing.

We have to carry this on into the Wolves game!

KTBFFH 💙",༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ REECE TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ,,"Yes Havertz and Mount are underperforming, but the biggest gulf in the world right now is just how shit Jorginho has become. Kovacic played better, more accurate, and longer passes in 45 minutes (after a month out) than he did all game and we're expected to attack freely and openly through the middle of the pitch? Ruben may be a significant downgrade on Kova, but he actually carries the ball forward and comes back to defend, what the fuck does Jorginho do? Tactically, leaving Jorginho isolated but with no ability to foul someone on a counter is not smart and it cost us today, vs Leeds, and it'll continue to cost us going forward.",Get the fuck in Kai. Nothing against Cucarella but I can’t wait for a fully fit Ben Chilwell. So I’m biased and I think we all are but I think the reason they brought the WHU goal back was because Bowan is straight up dragging his leg to make contact with Mendy. That’s at least how it looking for that one angle. Still harsh on west ham but honestly I don’t give a fuuuuuu,Thanks Villa. Very generous and very cool. Kepa MOTM and great changes by Potter.,"Very good win considering we were a man down. Same issues look like they’re still there though. Unless it’s Reece putting it on a plate we don’t create anything.

Also should be keeping Leicester at the table and be putting a bid in for Tielemans tomorrow","This has happened too many times to be coincidence, or Taylor's incompetence. There is a clear anti-Chelsea agenda every time Taylor officiates a match.","I thought today could be a problem for us when I saw Jorginho on the team sheet. He is a great player but he needs time on the ball and, if there's one thing Leeds are good at, it's aggressive pressing. Between his slowness and Connor's lack of chemistry with the rest of the team, most of our problems came from that part of the pitch.  That said, nobody played well today. Hard to say who was worse between koulibaly and Mendy. Shockingly poor performances from the both of them

The only bright spot for me was that RLC stopped it being 4. On a day where we looked lazy and the game was already gone, he kept the effort up and saved us further humiliation. I like to see that effort, especially from a player who often gets criticized for not putting in a shift

Aside from that I'm just glad that it's early in the season. Part of the problem is that we signed a ton of new players near the end of the window and you can tell they don't quite click together yet. Let's give it some time to work"
19,"Sack this fraud because he's going to get us relegated.

Erik ten Hag beat Barcelona which is the 1st team in La Liga, he's also 3rd in the league, nearly the same points as Man City. And he had3 months more than Harry Potter, but his club didn't spend 600mln on this season and look at the results.

Our coach Harry Potter should be sacked no matter what, because he's simply not good enough for a top club. He reminds me Nuno Santos when Spurs hired him and then sacked him because he's not a world-class manager.

I have no fucking idea, how can we play so fucking bad when you have a 600mln spent in 1 season, and you're in the 11th place.",Okay seeing how happy Graham was hugging all the players at the end made me smile,"10/10 for Wesley Fofana. Huge performance.

That’s how you get a result at home.","Has to be the end for Potter, surely","Positives: Felix + Ziyech, they both gave 100% and were unfortunate not to score, they also had good chemistry between them and Havertz. Chilwell clearly the best LB we have.  
Negatives: Mudryk was not good at all but i'm sure he'll improve. I also cannot believe we have zero natural striker registered for this competition.","kepa: nervy moments but no major complaints

silva/badiashile: absolute class, deserve better

reece: looked slow and off the pace, understand he’s just easing in so just glad to see him come off without any recurrence

cucu: very very bad

enzo: really good, needs to clean up a bit and should be paired with a real dm but looked our best creative player instantly

gallagher: atrocious for 70% of the game, instantly better once mount went off but is just running around doing nothing a lot of the time, the patrick beverly of football. can at least shoot from range

mount: i have been harsh on him for weeks now but holy shit, excepting that cross to kai which enzo put on a plate for him to deliver, actually one of his worst games of all time. whatever magic dust he had during the cl run is exhausted, he’s not even ineffective he’s actively harmful at this point. i don’t think his pressing was good at all today either

mudryk: looked off it from the start, mount was in his space but not nearly as dynamic as his debut, played it way safer for some fucking reason. i hope we don’t coach the aggression out of him

ziyech: is going blameless for coming back into the team without much complaint, coped with the physicality of fulham about as well as expected, put in a few nice balls but reece underlaps him instead of overlapping him these days and i don’t think that suits reece much at all

havertz: some positives in his work rate from the beginning and his dropping deep to receive but my god he needs to finish. he needs to play at the 10 spot whenever felix is out of the team because he’s just not a striker. worse than everyone bar cucu, gallagher, and mount.

chilly: looked uncertain and is definitely not 100% but instantly better than cucu

ddf: i don’t want to be harsh but that gilt edged chance when he should have squared to kai was a brutal rookie moment. he looks raw but there’s a real player there, a year on loan and he should be ready for the first team

azpi: better than his usual fare these days but i have nightmares of willian putting him in a pretzel. i love him though

madueke: really bright debut, not on the same page with anyone yet but i like him a lot

sterling: was taking a fucking beating, not much of note but glad he’s back in the team

overall we looked disjointed and fragmented, nobody knows how to play together. clearly great raw materials but they need coaching ffs. potter needs a preseason so bad. 2 weeks midseason with 40% of the squad injured is not enough to get them playing together.","**Next PL game :)**

What a pathetic performance against a team that has been shockingly bad all year. Did NOTHING after the Sterling goal. Not a single shot on target.

I’ve been saying this shit for 2 years now, every game that you start Azpilicueta at right back you are playing a man down. He needs to do what Jose did and play a player out of position at right back because we will be looking exactly like this every game Azpilicueta plays.",I don’t know how many more times I can take watching us play pretty well against this ridiculous City side and still end up losing.,"Excellent first half. Managed it well enough second half. Happily, happily take that.

Front 4 were brilliant first half with their decisiveness and their press. Thiago Silva is majestic. Jorgi and Zakaria were class. Hope Reece James is okay.",Game should be a lesson for those who thought getting rid of TT would solve all our problems. Huge issues in the squad that will take a long time to fix. Really need to back Potter now,"This is the result that kills the idea of Jorginho 'controlling the game'. He is a really poor ball playing midfielder, his best traits are all off the ball and defensive. Since Tuchel has gone his mythical 'tempo' ability has disappeared with it. It was always in the tactics and now it's clear to see.   


Once we move on to a superior ball player in the midfield we'll get back on track without doubt. Jorginho is too slow, lacks the vision and technique to play at this level. All the Jovacic nonsense has disappeared too. The truth was that Kante is a phenomenal player and improved the team by heaps by covering the entire midfield load himself, winning the ball, starting counters high on the pitch, dribbling the ball further, and playing progressive. We are now lost as a team.  


Hopefully Jorginho goes India and has a spiritual retreat too.",Can we please play wingbacks at wingback? Can’t keep putting attackers who can’t defend and wonder why they concede,"5 years since we last beat these cunts in the league, fucking sick of it.",RLC giving me real Willian ‘stop think pass’ vibes. Killed the attacking momentum every time he got it near the box.,"Yep, I expect the reaction to this defeat to be completely rational. 3 defeats in 4 doesn't look good, but isolating this game it's nowhere near as bad as that.

7 changes and you could tell but we were still decently in the game in the first half. Their keeper was on fire, poor Lewis Hall could've had two on another day. Great positive performance from him! Countered well in the first half I thought, looked to play out and play it forward quickly, often to our detriment but you can't deny it wasn't a more positive approach. Shame we're crap at taking our chances, but that's not a Potter problem - that's an ingrained problem.

Kova was off the boil and Zakaria was poor (no wonder he hasn't had a sniff) so midfield was very open. Defence was shaky aswell - though I thought Cucerella was very good. Start of the second half they turned it up a gear and got 2 ahead and it was game set from there.","Gonna get bombarded, but Pulisic >> Sterling rn IMO.",Why would ziyech take that second one again??

Tuchel is stubborn with his tactics/player selection and when they go wrong he makes ridiculous substitutions to deflect blame. 

He doesn’t trust Trev at RCB but trust Conor in a double pivot? He doesn’t trust Puli or Ziyech who have actually had good runs of form but trust Havertz every game when if you take away the UCL Final goal, what has he done? Out coached today.

On a lighter note - watching Ziyech and Sterling try to take a touch and/or shot with their opposite foot is absolutely fucking hilarious. I laughed multiple times.","Bloody hell that post match interview with Potter was predictably dull and still managed to disappoint me. “Nothing to complain about” with VAR, lol.

Shame about James but I'd be lying if I said it isn't starting to look worrying.","This is one of the worst performances I've witnessed in recent times. We had problems with Tuchel and Lampard; I've seen our attack be toothless, wasteful, dominate possession with no end product. But we were a mix of nothing today. We could barely string a few passes together, we could barely get out of our own half, we didn't even attempt shots. As a Chelsea fan, maybe I've been spoilt, but I have always seen my team compete. This was one of the worst Chelsea performances vs a team not named Man City. I'm hurting.","We're a mess of a team right now, almost no positives at all. We have a lot of injuries, so that's one thing we can point too. Even so, with the teams we've been putting out, we should be getting better results. 

We can be grateful that the World Cup break is now because we need a reset.",It’s like he set us up to lose 3 points. Sterling and Pulisic at wingback? You’re just begging to be exposed defensively.,Pain.,"I've said it in the last three postmatch threads but we really need to abandon 3atb without Reece. It just doesn't suit us without him opening the entire right flank up himself. We were bailed out last match with two gifts of goals and were lucky to already be up a man and two goals against milan. Potter has to give it up.  
Also, theres no excuse for Pulisic not to get a run anymore. Havertz needs an extended stay on the bench too and Broja has earned some more time. ","Our last 2 losses have been horrible; compare that to this game and it wasn't bad at all obviously we cant score but we had a good game and lost to a better team.

The tactics are obviously lacking and I'm the biggest critic of the system we play. But dear lord, we have some of the worst quality on the ball. Horrible first touches, horrible passes, inability to beat a single player and to top it all the worst kind of decision making I've ever seen.

Everybody including Tuchel needs to hang their heads in shame after this one. Go back to the drawing board. Work out a proper system to play with the limited quality on offer and somehow finish top4.

21,"Again a lot of question marks after this game...

\- Why the fuck did we start wasting time from the very first minute? How many PR posts, interviews etc. did we have to see before the game how excited the team is for this game, how many good talks they all had and how positive everything is? So our gameplan is wasting time trying get a 0-0 over the line?

\- I don't get his team selection again. You start D. Fofana against Saints, sub him off at ht and leave him out of the sqaud for todays game. Instead you put Auba on the bench who wasn't in the squad since the Liverpool game. Brings him on with 7 mins to go to take the absolute piss. How on earth is any player let alone a striker supposed to gain confidence that way?

\- You start Ziyech again even though he was about to leave in January and everyone knows he is off in the summer. Why is he allowed to drag down our game week in week out? You don't even bring him off at HT when he just escaped a red card? Is he that good or does he contribute that much? Clearly not.

It just hurts man. I am not even asking for wins. All I want is an exciting performance so watching the game does not feel like torture for a change.",Cucurella and Koulibaly turned up big time when we needed them. Elite performance from Cucurella especially,Fofana and Badiashile are a great pair 💙,If it wasn’t for the ten points from Tuchel’s six games I wouldn’t have ruled us out from being dragged in to the relegation fight.

Start games with this attitude and maybe we can get something from a game. ?,"Lost the game with the starting line up, no structure or discipline",Save of the season if Kepa made that,"Immediate thoughts:

1. I don’t see where Havertz fits in this team or the PL in general. Dude will kill it back in the Bunda like Timo.

2. I wish RLC didn’t play afraid. I always feel like he hesitates a second or two long and misses some golden opportunities. Dude could be a world beater if he was more aggressive. 

3. Havertz + Mount is a no. Need wingers who can beat their man. 

4. Per everyone in the match thread, I liked what I saw from Broja (raw but good), Auba, and Pulisic. 

5. Brentford bodied us the last time we played them. So not the worst draw?","Its clear the players need some time to train under the manager. Not an excuse, but having to play a match every few days while traveling definitely hasn’t helped this team gel together. 

Bright spots, but holy shit these players are allergic to scoring. Hall should have scored twice, pulisic should have scored a tap in early on, azpi’s cross to sterling was awful.

This is gonna take a little time to gel folks... Relax a bit.

Couple of immediate observations right now....

Azpi should only ever be a sub anymore.  I get you want his leadership, but he just doesn't have the legs anymore.  Fofana should've been starting there.

Broja needs to get a good run with the starters.  I think he's gonna be a stud.  Give him some time together with the preferred 11 and I think he'll take off.

Something else has to be tried up front.  Havertz again did very little this game.  I'm not sure what the solution is, but he was not good again.  Maybe Auba/Broja up top?  Maybe try Pulisic up top behind Auba or Broja?  No idea, but something has to be tried there.",Maybe the miserable people on this sub will shut up for a while.  Just an amazing performance today.,Mount played really well. I just feel we won't know our level because the game became really weird after the red.

You don’t buy a Ferrari and let a toddler drive it, do something Todd",Bellingham Is a cunt ...He Has liverpool tag over his ass,Feel bad for Enzo coming in and immediately having to carry our midfield. Gallagher and Mount are awful,"First half was great except the ball watching from the right side that led to the goal. JF and Enzo were outstanding. Havertz, Mudryk, Madueke were decent.

The second half subs killed off the game. I feel like we were better defensively when Ziyech came on. Mostly safe passes to retain the ball. I didn't see any runs towards the defenders and just one or two crosses into the box from him. It was just the ""old Chelsea"" game plan under Tuchel and end of Lampard.

Mount not passing to Ziyech right before the penalty shout was just tragic but we are just holding on to the embers of a fire that went out in the first half.

Chilwell decent. Maybe in the next game he can start over Cucurella.

Gallagher poor.

Dropped points against Liverpool, Fulham and West Ham. Depressing stuff.","Why are our players afraid to shoot the ball? Also, our attack looked much, much better as soon as Mudryk came on. Almost like he gave the entire attack a confidence boost. He’s going to be so fun to watch. Mudryk, Joao, Reece…going to be electric.","I hate this fucking squad. Worst part is Potter will get the blame despite Kepa being a Sunday League goalkeeper, Felix getting himself sent of idiotically, the first goal coming from a deflection and Havertz/Mount being as effective as a ventilated condom","I hope someone's in the dressing room calming Fofana down because I know I'd be absolutely fucking raging if I made 10,000 forward runs on my debut and no one even attempted to pass me the ball",GAR.

A new goal keeper is needed in the near future(have you noticed we have two back up keepers and not a one good one?). Gallagher cannot play in the pivot. Havertz needs Werner or someone to help him out. If the signings don’t go right in the next few days Tuchel is in trouble.
23,"I don't see how the club can keep Potter in the job for much longer. He's lost the players, he's lost the fans. The team has gone backwards since he's taken over with no signs of improvement.

Kovačić absolutely dominated, a truly towering presence in the midfield. Enzo was nowhere to be seen the whole match, though

how pathetic of us","Don't care for the negative takes on this one, we played well and were the better team just once again not clinical at all. Felix played very good but should have had at least 1 goal. Havertz not threatening enough up top at all, some nice link up but slow in other times. Really would have liked to have Sterling for this game..","The issue this game was the midfield. Mount and Gallagher cannot just leave the DM whether it’s Enzo or Jorginho by themselves. We need Kovacic or Zakaria back asap.

Enzo, Madueke, Badiashile, Silva, David Fofana and Azpi were class. Reece, Ziyech and Gallagher showed sparks of brilliance but were shaky. Mount was pretty bad (needs to be rested or benched to regain his form from last season). Kai was very unlucky, so was Fofana. Mudryk was isolated since he had to constantly drop into help Cucurella - who had a howler. Btw, he was subbed off since he still doesn’t have match fitness. Sterling showed sparks but made many bad decisions and Chilwell wasn’t on to do much but whip in a nice corner, which apparently our players have lost the ability to do.","Fuck Pawson.

Fuck VAR.

Buy Felix.

That is all.",Mudryk showed flashes. Excited to see the squad at full strength with him,Cucurella really proving why an out of position youth player who can't defend or shoot still starts ahead of him,This ship is sinking fast,"That was horrible.

We know we leak goals so 1:0 is never safe, push on and get another.","Fantastic performance, even if Milan had quite a few injuries they still had a massively dangerous player in Leao up front. Think we did well to stifle the amount of time and space he had for the most part.

Thiago Silva with another performance that makes you question how old he may actually be.

Think Koulibaly looked much better today, and Chalobah slotted in really well considering who he was against. I hope to god that Fofana isn't a big injury, he looked REALLY dissapointed. Will be gutted if he plays what like 4 games for us and then picks up a massive injury.

Mason with a very hot and cold performance today. An improvement on his last couple games, but still some mistakes that he needs to iron out.

Our front 4 bossed the first half.  Could've had 4 or 5 in the first(and would've with a competent ref).

Seemed to lose our legs in the last 30, which is concerning, but hopefully we'll get back into game shape quick.","Unsurprisingly 5 years of horrific transfer activity has left our squad in a pretty dire situation. No creative players, no goal threats and most of our best players are injury prone (Kante, Kova, James and Chilwell). When everyone is fully fit we can still field a great XI and challenge for cups but we just have no chance in the league. For me Chelsea finishing 2nd should be seen as a poor season and yet here I am praying for 4th, it's not good enough.

Hundreds of millions have been pumped into this current squad and the only player we can rely on to play consistently at a good level is 38 year old Thiago Silva.",Imagine spending all that money to get rid of a manager barely a few games into the season only to end up in a worse position.

Subbing Jorginho on to chase the game seems daft. We're lucky we didn't concede after yet another stupid loss of possession in our own half.

Conceded right after substitutions, which smells like a lack of focus. Team also lost their heads against Leeds. Some mental work to be done.

Lucky to win this one.",Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,Gallagher just needs a few more games to settle in. Tuchel shouldn’t drop him just for these past matches,At least this game showed the hype about spurs was misguided,"This is the same story as last year. With Kova and Kante out we regularly got outplayed by relegation fodder. Yet we didn’t fix it during the summer. This will continue to bite us throughout the season. Gallagher may be the answer but it will take him years to reach Kova levels. 

I am kind of done with Mendy. He has done this so many times. The impact of a goal like this cannot be underestimated. It demoralizes the team, fires up the home crowd, and energizes an already high energy Leeds team.

What has happened to Mount ? He just looks so average this season. I almost know that he will no longer finish his chances or put a threatening ball in anymore. And his corners are shit. 

Havertz - I have no idea what he does. Just needs to be offloaded from the team. 

KK was awful today, but this is almost his PL christening. Rudiger was pretty bad when he joined Chelsea. I am sure he will learn."

Mount you have it in your right to demand an improved contract, but if we actually give him something near or above 200k I'll actually get sick. He's good all round, not great at anything really.

Get the fuck outta here... 

Kai Havertz - there's your wonderkid right there,  third season of absolutely nothing.

They were always forced to choose between one of two choices (both choices being mistakes) as they were out-manned. Looked a lot better in the second half with a back 4.

I'm ok with RLC being a utility player and covering a few positions but we might need to break the bank for a Kante replacement.

Havertz, Kovacic looked good.","Bit late but Sterling should be dropped he's been woeful since the Salzburg game and wastes so many opportunities with weak passes/shots or hesitating until a defender can get a block in.

Pulisic should be starting, Aubameyang is hardly getting any service and I'd like to see Chukwuemeka start a game with Kovačić nursing a knee injury (how amazing is he btw bossing a game with a bad knew).

Without Reece James the right hand side is really rough going forward and the left hand side isn't great either now that Sterling's dropped off. Chilwell doesn't offer much when he's not in the opposition box either we play a winger there or start a 4atb with Cucurella playing deeper where his passing shines. 

Jorginho was great after the formation change, at the base of a midfield 3 there are few better than him.",We tried. On to utd.,"Seems like we had our best attacking play with Ziyech on the field. While he was on, Pulisic was also playing better then. Our youngest player probably had the best game, just too inexperienced in front of goal.

Absolutely shambolic performance from all involved. 

Tuchel needs to start coming up with solutions and not just excuse after excuse. Being completely outplayed by Leeds and Southampton is shocking.

Very lucky not to have conceded 4 or 5 where we barely even took a shot in the second half.

Completely out of ideas, and if we’re being perfectly honest we have regressed the longer Tuchel has been here. Zero improvement to our attack in over a year and a half. We wouldn’t have scored again if we had another hour to play

Also it's time to drop Mendy. We really need to give Kepa a chance.","A lucky but hard earned 3 points. Full credit to Kepa, Mason, and Connor (for when he came on).

Also Silva mate you need a fucking shield you absolute mad warrior.

Great game from azpi since he came on as well.

Gallagher fucked up his chance to do something when Kante and kova were out","Positives: We really dominated the game. RLC on the wing looks good, and James at RB works well as he still gets up to help the attack a lot. His defensive work on Son was perfect. Cucurella and KK on the left too really positive. Great work ethic and pressing from the forwards. Kante and Jorgi were positive with their passing and the passing overall was good and slick and opened up space for the movement of players.
 
Negatives: Our attack lacks a focal point. Same problem for years. And I cant believe we let Hojberg score.

Overall, way more positive than negative. On another day we would have won that 2-0. Im optimistic about the season, but these type of performances are common against the bigger teams for us. We need to play with same intensity against lower teams too.",Broja please be healthy to start next week. Perhaps give Pulisic or CHO starts too.

The guy is just not ready for this level.,"The worst thing on Potter is that I know we will never go up a level after the half. It’s always worse and lethargic. Tuchel always had us cooking coming out of the half.

The fact that a player can train with us for a couple of days and slot in our starting 11 is an indictment to our players and staff. We can claim all the players are terrible but can we name one player that improved under Potter? Gallagher was on fire at Crystal Palace. Koulibaly was great at Napoli. Kova helped Croatia secure bronze in the World Cup. Ziyech delivered for a historic Morocco World Cup run. Cucarella was scouted by Man City. Auba can work in Barcelona but not here? And the list goes on and on.

The problem isn’t just bad players, it is the complete lack of a team system and identity on the field. How does a world class club end up with 11 injuries, can’t all be bad luck. How about our man management? Are we playing to our players’ strengths? Seeing Gallagher and Sterling at wingback is normal and expected? How about our game management? Everybody in the game thread was screaming for Potter to take off Chalobah long time before we conceded the goal. There’s no improvement in any aspect of our game. None.

Honestly, I am just venting. I don’t know if sacking Potter is the answer but I don’t want to wake up in a relegation fight either. I don’t know if bringing Tuchel or Zidane will magically make things better. I don’t know what to think and I don’t know what I want. All I know is whatever I am watching right now isn’t the level expected from a Champions League winning team.",Only positive i can take from this game is that the team only has to worry about the prem and champions league now.

You can pick out like 8 players who didn't manage a single good play.","As shit as it was to lose, we played so much better today given two subs had to be made within the first half. Carney looked very good, Zakaria did a very good job in his role. Disappointed but nowhere near as bad as we were expecting it to be.","Just got back to my hotel room from the match. Absolutely amazing experience! I was in the lower west stand block 1 row 6 so both goals happened right in front of me. Incredible! Also as an American, was an honor to see Pulisic play as much as he did. I was afraid I wouldn't see him play at all. Now, on to celebrate!","Disgraceful. It actually looked like Arsenal were playing in second gear, against a lower table team. Utter Disgrace.  

There's so much to unpack that's not even worth commenting on, like a midfield as slow as Jorginho and RLC pairing, Azpilicueta being finished etc. 

But I'll mention 2 players, where the fuck was Mason Mount??? Moving forward I know he's a very good player, but he should not be invincible,  he was anonymous. 

Kai Havertz - well, where to begin? Honestly we're deluding ourselves if he's going to turn good. I've seen enough, we have all seen enough of him to know he's not going to be good enough. Sell him in Januray I don't even care anymore. He was fucking woeful.

I know it will take time but think he should be dropped for a bit, play cucurella back out in his natural position (even though he's also been shaky).",Our decision making in the final third is fucking horrific. There was easily multiple tap ins if our players just pick their heads up.,Left the shooting boots at home today. Could care less about the cup since less games probably benefits us at this point.

To be expected, it won't all be rosy! Credit to Kepa, you ensured we got all points here today!","So proud of the boys today. Scoring 2 with a man down is such an achievement.

The dude isn’t getting any minutes and then when he does, he’s positioned so badly that you really gotta start questioning what Tuchel is doing."
27,Dont think Arteta did this bad...,Anyone who was wishing for a loss just so the club might fire Potter can get the fuck out.,"Outstanding displays: Bada, Kouli, Fofana, Chilly, Kova, Enzo. Kepa marshalled well. 

However, Ruben struggled against the tricky wingers of Leeds. Also, our front line is still a mess. I really like it when Kai comes back and gets involved, but he loses way too many aerial duels, and doesn't win fouls like Drogba did, which would help massively.

Sterling continues to try his luck and sometimes does something good, but in my opinion he dribbles way too close to opponents. He should entice players out, rather than try repeatedly lose the ball because aren't shit in this league and in Europe.

Felix was nowhere this game, though he didn't have too much space to operate in.

Still not happy with the performance but I liked how the formation functioned defensively and even the midfield, but we easily could have drawn that game",Karma for firing Tuchel.,I mean it’s the best we’ve looked all season. January signings looked great. Defense was good. Ziyech electric. Unbelievable we lost off of one tremendous adeyamj run,"DD Fofana and Mandueke both showed potential even if a little raw at times.  Fofana more raw.

Badiashile was fantastic on both sides of the ball. He's a player.

Enzo was very good the whole game, he's living up to the hype for me. Will likely shine even more with a better midfield partner.

Everyone else outside of silva and kepa, who were great, were poor to mid. I'll give mudryk a pass cuz I guess he's not fit. The rest of guys were playing how they usually play... which is not good.","Outplayed by 17th West Ham, made them look positively exhilarating compared to the boring dross we play.

Moyes 2.0 starting to look like a compliment.  My lord.","Props to Ziyech too, he was whipping passes into that box, unlucky no one was able to bang one in. Might be in the minority but I think he should stay, he provides something different. We saw a bit of it today but I can see Ziyech whipping passes to the far side with Mudryk coming in on it as a dangerous weapon",no wonder we are ass attacking wise if our RWB is Mr backpass Azpi. He is a Legend but this should be his last season for us,"Season done, I’m excited for the summer friendlies!",I have been saying this for a long time. Remove fucking Jorginho from the midfield. Dude is slow as fuck and is easily manhandled. Recycling the possession is not enough.,"Positives: youngsters + Zakaria looked great
Negatives: Paul Tierney, Auba",Team looked pretty solid and I'd say that aside from Reece's injury it was a good day over all.,"What’s frustrating to me lately is just that we keep seeing the same team when player performances are consistently sub par. Yeah we have a lot of defender injuries but not in our attack. Why not switch it up? I’d rather see different players on the pitch than the same team yielding the same results match after match. 

Sterling, Aubamayang, and Kai have consistently been poor and have offered nothing in attack in recent games. They’ve all had an occasional goal to paper over the cracks but I don’t understand how they constantly start. If I were Broja, Gallagher, or Pulisic I’d feel so deflated and would have no idea how I’d ever break into the starting lineup and string together a few starts. Like they come on with good energy and direct play and it’s like “why haven’t they started?”

Potter needs to start taking responsibility for his choice of attack. One of the journalists needs to straight up ask “the attacking trio of sterling Havertz and aubamayang has been quite poor. What’s it going to take for your other attacking players to get a start and run of games?”",No Kante + No James = No Party,Fuck whatever the fuck that was.,"By far the highlight of this fixture was Kovacic running off the pitch with just his pants on and the look the woman at the tunnel gave , and this didn't even happen during the game.","Felt Potter got the subs wrong tonight. Havertz should have been off at HT. He was atrocious tonight. Pulisic should have been on way sooner.

Broja should not have come off and neither should Cucurella. We lost balance without a natural wingback on the pitch.

Not sure why it took so long to bring Auba on though. Strange decision that. On the plus side, Kepa looks extremely confident at the moment and made some more good saves.

Chukwuemeka also looked a bright spark when he came on. On to the next one I suppose.","City wasn't even taking it seriously, they took it serious for some time scored two then dropped the gear again. Pep wants us to keep Potter. Lewis Hall was the only positive.  I don't want to say same things again and again, but I hope whatever we plan to do is not just blind faith.

Edit- Also feels a bit for Omari, should have gotten some mins. Hall was brilliant, how good it would have been if he scored even one of the two chances, man.","Alright, bring on PSG I guess. Written in the stars",I'm scared of Mitrovic on Saturday,Pulisic deserves a start over Sterling after this game. Great job all around!,The players we need to score start scoring? League fucked.,I'm loving this 5 sub rule,"There are people really drawing conclusions about Tuchel vs. Potter or if its the squad or Tuchel after Potter hasn't even had a full week with the team lol. Unbelievable.

I liked the progressive play I saw, players are actually looking for runs. Not gonna draw much more, this is a squad in transition, could have been better in the final third as usual but I'm excited to see how we develop under Potter.",Hope Fofana is ok,"Boom, last in the group to first, bitches.",,"Havertz and Mount cannot start next game surely? Broja looked a lot better once he came on. I'd start Pulisic on the left, Sterling on the right, and Broja in the middle against West Ham, but if Tuchel continues benching Pulisic, then play Havertz behind Broja and Sterling up front. Another issue is also our midfield. Kovacic still not fully fit, RLC now injured. Gallagher returns. Great... but he cannot do anything in a pivot. What's Tuchel's issue with Gilmour? Surely he deserves a start. Because I don't trust a midfield of Jorgi and Gallagher.","Don’t let this victory distract you from the fact that we did not look good at all. 

Still take the 3 points all day any day though",Well first game without Reece and it was shaky. Kepa redemption arc in full swing,"Superb game from Cucu today, I'm very pleased with his performance",What the fuck is the point of  var when they look at a blatant foul and don't do anything about it,"Absolutely shameful performance. Outrun and out-battled everywhere you look.

Being dead serious here. At what point do questions need to be asked of what Tuchel is intending on doing here? 

This summer he’s had complete control to get who he wants in and yet we’ve still persisted with this system which stifles us in attacking sense whilst also seemingly not making us stronger defensively.

When I look back a year ago, I’m struggling to see what has changed and improved. The same problems that existed then still exist now."
28,Honestly don't know how anybody is still Potter in,"Never doubted potter for a second, great win (don’t look at my comment history)","Three points is three points! Thought Fofana, Kepa, and Chilly were great, and that the Enzo/Kova pivot showed some good moments.","Goodness, even Lampard would be better than whatever this is. At least we will get goals",I thought we played well but it is glaringly obvious we need a striker.,desperately need our midfielders to return and for reece and chillwell to be 100%.,"What a shit triple substitution by Potter that killed the game. Mudryk played good but was isolated because of cucurella. Then Potter brings on Chilwell who can involve him but also decides to sub him out at the same time....

Meanwhile, he brings on Ziyech and mount, both of whom I don't have much issue with. But we went from 3 attackers who can dribble to just 1. From there, we lost all attacking threat. The balance wasn't there anymore because all West ham needed was to mark out felix.

The right sub was Chilwell and mount for cucu and madu. We focus the attacks on the left with James in space to deliver balls on the right.

Overall I'm not upset because we drew. The equaliser was shit defending, but I can accept that it happens. I'm really pissed because this was clear poor managerial decisions by Potter. I've been backing him and giving him the benefit of the doubt, but my tolerance for incompetence has its limits. Today's squad was just too good to fail","A little nervous, some awkward touches, but mudryk looks GOOD","I'll say it again - 
Essential players to the system in Chilly/Reece injured.
Crazy amount of covid cases & the FA not giving us any match delays or help, meaning we got overwhelmed on matches, which lead to more injuries.
Lukaku betrays everybody with stupid interview, destroying morale for a while.
We lose the Carabao Cup and any hope of Lukaku redemption by an incorrect ref offside call that VAR doesn't correct + an incident where Chalabahs balls get ripped open and Liverpool don't even get a yellow - let alone a red card for it.
We also lose the FA Cup on pens with badluck.


Somehow we WIN THE CLUB WORLD CUP and officially WIN EVERYTHING POSSIBLE EVER. Beautiful moment between Abramovic, Tuchel and Azpilicueta and everything seems great.

Russia invades Ukraine and Chelsea Football Club gets blamed by the UK media and I'm not even joking.
Then, an inept UK Government unjustly ripped our owner from us and places the club in sanctions.
The sanctions means we lose Rudiger aka the passion of our backline.


The club nearly ceases to exist but we get a American owner and go on a tour of the USA which burns out all the players and pisses off Tuchel.
We look like we should get a big, heroic, morale increasing win vs Tottenham but they outright pull Cucurella down by the hair for an equaliser, which they celebrate like a victory. (Of course shoutout to Anthony Taylor for being a biased, bald, criminal).

This leads to a downturn and our new owner makes imo an idiotic decision and fires our Champions League winning Manager Thomas Tuchel and replaces with a mid table team Manager Graham Potter.

Mount & Mendy & Jorgi, all of whom have been great for two years and won us the UCL/Super Cup/Club World Cup - form dips.

Then, every single important player gets injured again - specifically Reece James AND Chilwell again. Even worse we lose N'Golo Kante aka the best player on the team/arguably in the world on his day.
+ a revolving door of everybody else getting injured including Mendy (who's form self imploded), Pulisic & Sterling in the same game, Broja for 9 months, + more every game, like Zakaria today. 

Suddenly, we are losing every game.

Kepa briefly has an up-turn in form but is slowly going back to his old ways of standing still and watching the ball be shot at the net, hoping it doesn't go in, forgetting he's the only person in the stadium who's supposed to use his movement & arms to stop the shots or grab the ball in front of him. 

Long story short- Chelsea Football Club has gone through one of THE most traumatic experiences in modern football and we shouldn't act surprised that as a result, the shadow of all the bullshit is now clouding our performances and we are doing badly. 

We need a reset season next year to recover and bounce back. 

Never forget the T.Silva lining - that we have T.Silva playing at Chelsea.","City don't give players 500 chances to perform. City don't bother with ""cheap alternative"". They don't bother with ""decent squad option"". They don't bother with ""upgrades"" on wank players. 

This game is why. Large amount of our ""starters"" simply aren't good enough. And it has nothing to do with pashun. Has nothing to do with ""preffered position"". Has nothing to do with the World Cup. They are simply not Chelsea level

We won't solve this by getting a manger to ""get the best out of them"". We won't solve this by giving them chances. We won't solve this by giving motivational speeches. Only way to get out of this mess is selling off these bums for peanuts and ripping up the contract of everyone else, then actually paying up for the right players the first time instead of dillydallying.",I wanted to tear hair off my bald head when they were just back-passing with no aggression whatsoever in the last 5.,"Don't really want to shit on Potter here but just a few thoughts;

Zakaria - he looked amazing this game, looks better and better every game because he is getting fitter and sharper and used to this league. Today he was absolutely sensational, literally Kovacic levels of brilliance and we know what he has done for us. Yet Potter, didn't play him at all, didn't give him run outs, didn't do anything with him until he had no choice because all the CMs got injured, that is awful management.

Hall - This kid looks like the Reece James of left backs in terms of potential, every time he has played, which is twice against man city by the way, has looked at home like he plays against top sides every week, crazy, he needs to play more.

Kai - Kai in number 10 looks like that is where he needs to play, Broja getting injured is going to hurt this ""project"" because Potter won't play anyone other than Kai as 9 now as he doesn't trust or like Aubemeyang.

Connor - If he plays Kai as striker which i think he does in our next league game, Connor has to play behind him, because Connor gives the energy, Mount used to do this but i feel he is over thinking the game now which causes problems if those two start 10 and 9.

Carney - This kid is going places, wow, when we signed him i was confused as he wasn't playing much for Villa....but that just shows how shite Gerrard must been as a coach because wow, he looks so strong for his age already and every decision he made today was perfect, another one who has to start more games for us, probably will now due to the injuries but he should again been getting more sub appearances. 

Overall, this game tonight was great, we played well, if anything unlucky to lose as i thought we were a few decision making passes up front away from scoring and we hit the post. Potter needs to build on this with the players in the positions and really needs to stop picking people based on who they are over clearly the better talented players. Hopefully Potter is realising this now though and we move on and use this as the turning point in the season.","The miserable people in this thread have to be trolls and are actual fans of other clubs, right?

I thought he played well,God help us against Newcastle,"Is it unfair to say Pulisic has been our most consistently dangerous attacker over the last few weeks? Every time he touches the pitch he makes an impact. I’m hoping his brief appearance today was Potter saving him for Arsenal/World Cup.

Sterling, despite his nice goal, was more often a liability than an asset today. Havertz had a nice day but we need a lot more than that from him. Don’t see why Pulisic shouldn’t be a regular starter going forward

edit: Chilly just broke my heart. So unlucky","I know James/Chilwell are really good, but we just play so... Wide. Like, I can't remember the last time we tried to play through the middle. Every single chance we make relies on someone coming in from the side edges of the box",Love seeing Billy at the end of the game there getting love from all the players.,Big sigh of relief...,Lowkey RLC has been top notch for while. The man is faultless and honestly been our most reliable midfielder so far this season.,"Apart from the result, Chelsea looked pretty positive this game. Tried to get forward more and played quicker passes around the opponents leading to breaks. A bit more cutting edge in the final third and we could have won easy. Broja when he came on was great. 

Still need to figure out how to get the best of Havertz, he looked pretty aimless all game, the rest of the team looked alright for Potter's first game. 

And yeah Ziyech needs to be put in the reserves immediately.",Reece James is godlike. Somehow he just gets better and better.,"Jorginho the unsung hero tonight. Absolutely ran the game from start to finish. Worked his fucking bollocks off in that midfield.

Milan couldn't get near him. He was always available for a pass and kept the whole thing ticking over.",,"I don't know if it's the formation or what, but no one played well, and were dominated both by Leeds and Southampton. There was defensive stability once there was the switch to 5 in the back, but some of my notes:

- Kai Havertz, if he continues to start, should not be the main attacking forward. Borja came in and light up a fire for chelsea. 
- Sterling, outside of his goal, was awful. Just seemed to consistently make the wrong decision, passing when he should take the shot, and shooting when he should be taking the pass.
- I don't think I've seen Pulisic play more out of position than anyone on this team. I get that with james out, pulisic was the backup RWB but he's just plain ineffective at the spot. An actual RWB should be considered going forward in the case James is out.
- Once Kovacic and Kante are fully fit and Gallagher serves his suspension, Jorginho should no longer be considered the top choice midfield, especially against physical teams that press.","Chilwell came on and saved the match. Kai looked pretty good in the midfield behind Broja. The midfield the first 60 was not it. I want to like RLC but he turned every attack back.

Edit: Fofana looked great in his debut as well.",Not the prettiest but a win is a win. Thank you Mount thank you Kepa.,Please just stop putting mason as part of the front 3,They are acting like it’s a win over in their sub. Such a massive club.,"Three games in and collectively our forwards have 0 goals and 1 assist. That's absolutely abysmal especially since two of those games were against teams with shocking defensive records last season.

Chelsea in champions league is different gravy,"3 points is 3 points.

Set that negativity aside for a minute and just enjoy the W.",Over/Under 12.5 hours before Potter sacked?,"Really entertaining game tonight, best we've looked for a while. It's a positive that we were even getting those goal scoring chances in those positions, at one point we didn't even look close to scoring.

Instead he spent 660 million & all I feel is nothing.","Joao  Felix did things in that game I haven't seen someone in blue do for a  very long time, an excellent addition to the squad and will only get  better. Reminds me a bit of Wilshire at Bournemouth where you can just  see he's a cut above his teamates with his touch,  Felix's gliding  acceleration is a joy to watch.

Enzo  made our midfield look the best its been in months but he's still got  errors in him in terms of defensive covering and the odd lazy pass. He  has an excellent demand for the ball and a comfortability that I've  missed since the Ballack/Essien/Lamps trio. I'd like him to learn  English fast as we need a loud voice in the middle, and he looks like he  can bark.

Mudryk seems held back  by the service of Cucu and doesn't have faith that the overlap is going  to be there. When he did make runs the pass was deemed too difficult to  execute by Cucu so he mostly received the ball with his back to goal and  under pressure.

Noni was timid  and in my opinion at 20 isn't quite ready enough to be starting against  premier league defenders yet, he can do some great stuff but needs  polishing.

Our big issue is this  deluded idea that Havertz and Ziyech are just going through bad form and  that somehow they will one day click into gear and become the players  we all hoped they'd be 3 years ago when we signed them. Potter is naieve  in repeatedly starting him, wishing he'll be the one to unlock Kai's  magic change in fortune, it's hurting the team. Ziyech has been terrible  his entire footballing career at Chelsea and for Potter to take over  and give him the minutes he has is criminal.

As  for Cucurella I find it difficult to believe that an entire scouting  team sat and watched his performances for Brighton last season and  deemed him Champions League quality. We are playing at his exact level  at the moment which is mid table. It is painfully clear he is simply  nowhere near world class and I see no room for improvement as it is his  physical properties that limit him, aside from his height it seems like  he has to power up his leg before he crosses it takes so long, then once  he's hit the cross it's clearly taken so much energy if it gets  intercepted he's always off balance and in a bad position to then  recover and chase back.",[deleted],[removed],"I think we are in a state now where it’s not just the technical level or the tactics.

This is the squad that should be starting based on form. Mount in front of the two mids/behind forwards. Maybe Koulibaly can hop in for Chalobah depending on what you're looking for. Gallagher the first midfielder off the bench and Broja the ONLY forward who should be subbed in. 

Kai Havertz needs to sit for the remainder of the month of October. No end product, no hustle to compensate for it, bad attitude and body language.

On a positive note, Fofana was top class. I actually thought RLC played well in midfield. 

I think Havertz was more of a threat and a handful because Broja was up front and had to be marked giving Havertz that bit more freedom he needed.

Just cardio sessions.

10 days left of the window and we need a center back, midfielder and a striker. We have left it way too late.

Mendys form has been terrible for a while now too. That first goal completely killed any kind of momentum we had to win that game. 25 yards to get the ball out of your feet and you do that. If it’s a one off thing you excuse that but he consistently puts us into shit with his ball playing. 

I said in the game thread soon as he did that it was a wrap cause they and their crowd would be all over us from that point. Inexcusable"

Even after the world cup break with a supposedly mini pre season it's still the same old shit show.",Zakaria was excellent. Has to start.,"Comfortable win but definitely worried how we completely disappeared from the game in the last 30 minutes. We won't get away with letting most teams in the league have spells like we allowed Bournemouth to have today.

Gutted about Reece and trying to be optimistic but we might have to realise this could be what the rest of his career here looks like.

Been a pleasure to watch so far!","Gallagher is gonna get the front page news for that goal, but let's not overlook Kepa today.

Kepa kept us in that game.  He also looked very good playing the type of sweeper keeper that Potter wants with his distribution.  I think he's earned a few more starts and if he keeps playing like this it's gonna be hard for Mendy to retake the job IMO.",Can we just appreciate Potter for rotating the team well & bringing in the result.,One day this sub will stop blaming 10 minute substitutes and focus on the play of the other 85% of the match.,"Pleasantly surprised with how professional and composed we were. A lot better game management and organization compared to last two games. Bit of a timid start to the game but managed it well and showed our class in the end. 

James is obviously the GOAT but pretty much solid from everyone except maybe Chilwell and Sterling who looked a bit off their best. Would like to shout out Ruben, that kind of performance should earn him some more starts. Also not sure why Mount got so much hate in the match thread. Thought he was good.",*Fikayo Tomori says Chelsea will face the ‘real’ AC Milan at San Siro*,,People talk of teams being mentality monsters. We are mentality mice. Embarrassing. Absolutely embarrassing.,Tuchel looks clueless ngl. If it weren't from individual brilliance from chilli we wouldn't have won this match. What were we even trying to do in the first half attacking wise? Puli and sterling had no options to play up front.

We look so clueless it's actually insane, that's not our players","If Chelsea can create chances like this in the Prem, then that’s good. I don’t think this game is on Potter tbh. It’s also not on the players because in another timeline, the score could have been 3-1",Mudryk was quiet but didn’t anyone else feel like the ball just wasn’t going his way?,"1. Chilly > Cucu (but not fully fit for 90 yet, sad)
2. Mudryk was NOT the problem
3. Enzo + Kante is going to be electric
4. Havertz getting chances from this midfield will soon show whether he is quality or not
5. Potter's gotta have some urgency. Can't keep using the excuse that the team is new. CL is coming up...","Personally happy w the showing. Ziyech, Havertz, Jorgi, our entire back line showed life today which isn’t hasn’t been a given. Mudryk brings something completely different — looks like he brings a type of quality we haven’t seen in a very long time. Think if that’s a more experienced winger instead of Carney on the end of mudryk passes we just might have come away with a win.",I have no world. I have some but they are all curses and swearing.,The worst part of this for me is how poor our off the ball organisation looks. The players don’t seem to have an idea where they’re supposed to be and it’s just a mess…,"Why do we shit the bed so hard in 2nd halves?

Where is the mentality?","We showed fight and grit but it wasn't quite enough. Still, I expected much worse and I wasn't hiding behind the sofa or boiling over from watching the game. Zakaria really impressed me and I'm sad to say, maybe Mount needs some more time out of the team to refocus and come back stronger. Zakaria was able to play through the press confidently multiple times. I feel bad for thinking he was a bit of a nothing signing. He deserves to keep his place.


Zakaria, Kova and a creative mid seems pretty strong in the midfield. Chuk played well after coming on so maybe he could play more but he's not ready to be a world beater so I hope we sign one this window.","Great bounce back win. Think there’s an argument that Zakaria is not only an improvement, he might even be essential — broke up a lot of their developing play and provided complete protection for Jorginho who could be more ambitious with his passes. Gallagher with Jorginho looked a lot worse and necessitated the 3atb at the end.","Even with some mediocre games, pulisic and broja have looked by far the most impactful of any of the attackers, at least forcing the issue a bit. Sterling and Auba it’s just a bad first touch before falling over or just giving the ball directly to the other side.",I’d rather watch my grandma bathe than watch this team,"This is unsurprising, could just feel it with the way the game was being hyped up cause Potter was going back to Brighton","Starting lineup was questionable from the beginning. The Kova sub immediately turned the game around and then Potter waited way too long to take off Auba and Sterling. 

Pulisic should be starting against RBSalzburg, I wouldn’t hate more time for Broja too. Those two and Mount play really well together","Chuk played how I'd expect Havertz to play, him and Pulisic need more minutes",Why in the fuck did we let Tuchel go!!! Should have given him time to sort things out. I like potter but I don’t think he’s going to last very long.,"Sad for Chilly but if him and Reece can get some proper rest over the WC then it will be great for us

~~Plus England are doing nothing in that tournament~~","We just lost to a team whose starting 11 probably cost less than Fofana lmao. 

&#x200B;

The only real issue I had with Tuchel was why he didn't play Zakaria at all when we need to bully the opposition in the midfield more","Good to see Havertz on the scoresheet with a great goal.  
  
Could've scored 5 in this one. All of our attackers made mistakes, but they were also all very good at points.  
  
Really fun watch, but we really gotta get a feel for controlling a game again. Too much giving the ball away and too easy to counter. Maybe thats the trade off Potter is making to get us some chances to score.",What are we thinking of Gallagher starting more often he livened up the midfield when he came on,These last two games have been fun. I like this feeling.,So many attempts but none connect,Are there any superlatives left for Reece James. What a player!,All I care about is Reece... why him,,"Hot take but that was bad

Is this our team without Kante and James?

Still crying out for a good DM since Matic was sold

Tuchel has quite a bit to answer for as well. Team is inconsistent, still clueless attacking and we've been regressing massively in 2022 in defense.",I'd play Cucurella LCB with either Silva or Koulibaly on the bench. Chilwell is that guy and absolutely deserves to play,Good result from a game where luck and Kepa masterclass kept us on top somehow. 3 points is 3 points.,"Favourite matchday hot takes:


Sterling is a flop on game day4.

Mendy should be sold before the window ends.

I'm gonna go watch the Palace game.

Additional:

Mount needs to be sold",Unbelievable botch job by the entire reffing crew top to bottom today.  I have no words for how poor that was.  Good performance overall,"I don't agree with 90% of the garbage I've read in this thread, but you be honest, I couldn't get through all of it. 

Leeds played absolutely amazing. That team has an identity. They played like a hungry team and they out ran us. Absolutely world-class work rate. 

Cucurella was the worst player on the pitch. Awful heavy first touches and several off target passes. 

A pressing team exposes Mendy - he is awful on the ball and can't distribute. 

Sterling looked good again, Kai can't play offense.  Mount was very pedestrian as well. 

I think Gallagher looked like a beast. One of the only players on our team that matches their intensity. A couple of mistakes but he looks really good, imo.

Koulibaly. Wtf. The VERY poor decision to take that yellow so early in the match. He looked bad the whole game. Intimidating defensively but poor passing and outplay. 

Kai and Mount are better-suited as attacking midfielders, imo. But so is Gallagher. 

I actually think ziyech and pulisic liked good. If they aren't going to get more minutes, sell them. But FFS they are both going to crush it elsewhere - even in PL."
32,"I am 100% Potter out now.

He has got enough sympathy.

I can accept bad results bad problem is even after getting so much time and so much support we don't look like a team who can score one single goal .

Don't know what our style of play is.

First he had excuse of no midfielders then injuries and now he has almost fully fit squad yet we still don't look like a team that has any direction.

I actually feel bad for some of our players they are giving all and backing the Manger but his poor tactics are costing Chelsea a lot.",We're winning the Champions League.,Absolute haram ball in the last half hour,"Potter Out, no ifs or excuses if Boehly has any shame","Not scoring against Dortmund is shocking. Incredible atmosphere, glad we finally got to play them.

Mudryk does not look like a €100m player. People got excited because he put a 37 year old James Milner and Trent on roast. He clearly has talent but looks like he’s still playing at youth level. Hopefully he can be coached to have better movement.","The more we are adding quality players the more we see how bang average MM, Gallagher and Kai are. I've got nothing against them, apart from MM because he is turning into a right prick (maybe he doesn't like the fact that he isn't the poster boy anymore) , but it is clear they ain't good enough for this football club. Can't believe we have rejected 45million (!!!) from Everton for Gallagher. As for Potter, he will get the remainder of this season, but Boehley will not put up with performances like this next season.","I think I hve finally lost patience with Potter. He just doesn't seem to have ""IT"". Whether that be tactics, in game adjustments, shit even some fucking fire in press conferences for one of the most egregious VAR calls this season. He's too nice. 

The team yesterday was good. I liked the selection. But the game 2nd half was crying out for some new energy and he left it way too long. He seems unable to change the course of a game with in game decisions. He's too comfortable with mediocrity. We get the same response after every game. There's no accountability.

We've spent sooo much money and he does not look to be the manager to steer this team towards prolonged sustained success. 

I'm yet to really see him take a game on and make some bold decisions when we have many games that are so clearly there to be won be some brave tactical adjustments. 

I get players have been shocking too. But we is going on in training. We have some of the worst decision makers I've seen in elite football. Honestly it's staggering how bad some of our players are with final passes and whether to pass or shoot. 

He'll probably get to the seasons end, but I firmly believe a better manager with more conviction and a stronger personality would get this team heading towards success much, much quicker than Potter.","Ladies and Gentleman, join me in accepting Mykhalo Mudryk as our Lord and Savior","The right side of the team with Chalobah, Azpi and Mount the sole reason for today's loss. The lack of quality was shocking. A new RB needs to be a priority.","There are many links between the head coach and the players in a professional football club of this stature, so blaming an individual alone is silly.  
What's hilarious however, is thinking ALL the players became shit at the same time, then asking for the youngsters to be brought in, then abusing the youngsters minutes later.  
Fascinating!",You’d think we were the team in the relegation zone after watching that second half. Though it genuinely feels like we’re closer to that than we are to top 4. Shocking,We need to sign Zakaria. He’s fantastic,"If getting a suitable back up / competition for Reece isn't high on the agenda then we're going nowhere. 

I love Reece. He's our best player by a country mile but relying on him to stay fit and having Azpi as his replacement simply cannot continue.","Cucurella and Fofana might have been the dumbest way to spend £130 million ever.

Seriously would have made more sense to just buy Rice with that money and have an actual defensive midfielder.",Who would’ve thought getting a new manager every 1–2 years and having a squad of mismatched players for different systems isn’t a sustainable model to run a club.,No idea why Potter is persisting with a back 3 when we don't have the players available at the minute to use it effectively. Without James and Chilwell / Cucu at wing backs it does not suit us to set up that way. He needs to try something different,RLC in mid only to win duels. Did nothing apart from that. Using him for hisnphysical presence when he can't otherwise defend and has lost his attacking flair is on team selection. We should sign a midfield presence.

Thsi isn't a position development programme,"Pulisic was actually decent today, considering the dogshit tactics/formation Tuchel used in the first half.

I hope Ben is fully fit soon because he has to start in that wing. 

Fofana debut was very impressive, looks like he could be a World class defender. 

Mendy needs to be benched.

Please from now on, play Broja/Auba and Kai together.","Decent game from Mount and Kepa justifies his spot, but overall a pretty ugly game. Got the 3 points but hoping for an improvement vs Brentford, we were very sloppy.",prime shithousery by havertz at the end,That's one of the biggest robberies against us in the last few years,What did Hudson Odoi do to Tuchel?
33,"I have no hate for Graham Potter the man and was happy to keep him, until his team laid two eggs against the bottom placed team and a hated rival.

I'll take it!,"Should be the sacking, but it won’t be.",When can we last say we got a lucky break in a game? Palace away?,Can someone make mount fail comps?,"I'm Potter out now. Listening to Potter's post-match interview sealed the deal for me. I cannot believe how calm, 'diplomatic' and nonchalant he looks. I am absolutely livid we let that one slip with our terrible subs that killed the game basically and how Cucurella would rather make a backpass than find a Mudryk run and the blatant criminal VAR decision that went against us. If this was Jose, Conte, Tuchel, Sarri, even Avram Fricking Grant, he would be absolutely livid. Ridiculous. He was being too diplomatic and ""nice"" about the whole thing. Enough's enough.","Things I've learnt from this match:

• Badiashile is frighteningly reliable and compossed for his age. Only 21.

• Once Felix and Mudryk return, we're cooking. Aside from maybe Ziyech, they are clear of every other attacker we have.

• Mount needs some time on the bench. His performances haven't been up to standard.","We now have a full 11 of injured players, many of which would be undoubtedly in our best 11. 

Felix MOTM for us by far despite the idiotic red card. 

Hopefully Zaharia’s injury isn’t serious, we look much worse without him in midfield.","Koulibaly, Jorginho, Havertz, Mount, Kovacic are all starters for us and zero contribution from them today. Gallagher is leaving himself behind on the expectations.
There is no turning back now fellas. It’s time we put the club first and get the dead weight off the club and move forward. Players should be answerable. Managers are the ones who always take the heat.
It’s as if like every 5 yrs we run into the same situation.","Man we look bad, like we have no idea what we are doing bad. 

I was starting to think the purchase of Nkunku will be followed up with the sale of Havertz. But the fact that I didn’t think Havertz played well and he somehow was left in the entire game is just odd to me. My only guess is he still had energy in his legs while Pulisic was gassed?","Some thoughts:

Zakaria added some actual physicality into that midfield, something that is sorely missed when Jorginho plays with Kova. I think it's obvious that he's got some confidence now as we saw him driving forward and actually using that physicality, even after a few failed attempts.

Silva is timeless, if he stays another season with us - he is only 2nd to Terry in our modern day CBs (imo)! I don't want to be too harsh on Kouli - but he is so clumsy on the ball, his touches to get it out of his feet are all over the place. It makes it really hard for us to play out from the back on the left side. Personally want to see Trevor as our RCB for a few games and let Silva play his preferred side.

Hall is already good enough to be starting games or coming on as a sub in most games. The most important trait he has for his age is composure on the ball - hope he gets a start over Cucu on Sunday.

Ziyech needs a run of games, and hopefully should get that with our injuries. We need that creative spark on the right side with the Stamford Fridge out.

Auba looks past it, and has done for two years now. Yes he can score if he gets a chance, which is unlikely with how we've been playing, but it feels like we are a man down in games like this with him on the field. Probably why the sub got subbed.","Pretty much everyone performed today. Only real downside was Reece, but that didn’t look too bad either.

We’re also now six points behind fourth with a game in hand. Top four definitely not done like some think.","The excuses for Havertz are done, hes just not good enough. Sterling is clearly past it and on a steady downward trajectory. Why did we even sign Auba, did anyone expect him to rejuvenate our offense??? 

We are signing other teams deadweight and expect to compete.","Koulibaly is a fucking train wreck.

Mendy’s inability to handle the ball is sticking us in our own half.

This team has no identity and no fucking balls.

Complete joke of a football club right now.

More of a fight after the final whistle than during.

Blow it out your fucking asses, posers.","We got crazy scammed with cucu, didn't we? 70mil for this lad. Very limited defensively and awful on attack. What a waste man.",honestly didn't deserve to win...subs were good but EXTREMELY far too late,Why do you we keep playing with wingbacks when we don't have the right players for it? Just switch to a back 4 and play fucking wingers. We had like 7 central midfielders in the pitch,Where do these bullshit ratings come from? Lewis Hall rated lowest on the team? Ridiculous. He was great.,Potter saving PuliGOD for Arsenal.,Tuchel would lose his job before he plays with a front three of two wide players and a CF. It is a system problem. It always has been.,"Broja has a touch of Diego Costa about him, tough as nails, quicker than you'd expect, better with his feet than you'd expect and a bit of a cunt with it, his shit housing to see that game out was glorious, wasn't looking to score at all, just waste time. I'd love to see him start over Auba soon who i think has been pretty rotten recently.","On balance, I think we were probably just about good for the win. Palace will feel hard done by but the 3 points is huge for us here tbh and Crystal Palace is not an easy game this season so a win away from home is a very nice result even if we didn't play particularly well. Good to see Gallagher and Aubameyang on the scoresheet too.",Can this game finally be a lesson for Chelsea fans to never complain about the starting lineup again?,"Judging by how the sub treats Ziyech, I can see why the rest of the team is so afraid to even shoot. Maybe he should just resort to side passing like the rest of the team were doing the entire first half.","That was fun, more of those please. 

&#x200B;

Also very much hope Fofana is okay, didn't look too bad but I hate knee injuries.",Glad that Timo is doing so well for Leipzig again,,"Can we try to look at and discuss this defeat in a rational way? I’m not looking for “Tuchel out” or “Jorgi bad” kind of analyses. More where we as a club are lacking. Because we should definitely beat Soton with our starting 11, and we have definitely strengthened our squad since last season (except for injuries of course). 

To me it feels our problems are much deeper. Players lack intensity and intent. They look lost. Formations and strategies are a mess. Bar the spurs game we have been out pressed and out run in every match. We can’t press and are terrible at being press resistant. Tuchel keeps fielding the same players and same formations over and over again. What does he see that we’re missing? 

What is actually going on? Genuinely trying to make sense of it all.",Broja has played well every time he's come on so far this season. It's time to give him a start.,Andrea Martinez you better NOT break up with Kepa,I did not enjoy that but it is 3 points we definitely needed after the robbery at spuds and whatever that shit was against leeds. On we march.,At the end of the day we remain the best football club in London and Tottenham remain a glorified mid-table club.,"Literally the same team after Kante got injured against Spurs. We dominated Spurs, yet got embarassed by Leeds. What gives? It's the start of the season so fatigue is not the issue. I really question the players' mentality if they can't put in the same ferocity in an equally fierce rivalry.

I just don't understand today's performance. I keep telling myself every loss and bad decision will light a fire under the players, but I haven't seen much this season."

We looked awful in the first, but we should have had time to mount some kind of effort in the second. Refereeing was horrible and let them get away with a million fouls (and kicking Azpi in the face) to just completely kill off the game.","Really impressed with that other than the score obviously. Lots of positives to take from that and we actually played well for the full 90 minutes. RLC impressed me tonight. Enzo and Felix look class, and nice to have our fullbacks back. Looking forward to the Saints game.","As long as we're more concerned with ""pressures"" and work rate from our striker than actually scoring goals we're going to, yup you guessed it, struggle scoring goals. Havertz up front clearly isn't working. This isn't a knock on him, he's being played out of position. A natural striker should be starting every game.

This is the most dire, clueless football we've played in decades.

I remember back in the day under Jose if we went 1-0 up you knew it was game over, regardless of when we scored that goal. These players just don’t have that mentality",Potter had a bad case of overthinking. How Havertz stayed on that long I will never know.,"Not even gonna bother pointing out the negatives. Hall and Pulisic were really impressive, Ziyech had some nice moments as well. Hope to see more of them","Injuries ain’t on potter. We already baby players so much with rotation.

They need to learn to stop injuring themselves. Or our physios are out to lunch.","We didn't give up. That's about the only positive from that. And if we didn't give up against this lot and still got nothing, that's also still worrying.

We are too slow, no bravery on the ball, and once we get 30 yards from goal everything just seems a little more jittery and nervous.

Reece James the only one who can walk off with his head held high.

And I suppose Kepa too. Little he could about the goal and he made one great save.

Edit: by ""didn't give up"", I mean we were still pushing at the same intensity as the start of the game. That intensity is still nowhere *near* high enough and Tuchel should be giving the players a reality check. They're not as good as they think they are. Ziyech's cameo was borderline disrespectful.","I'm liking Chalobah more and more.And as usual,Broja played brilliantly for the limited time he got.","We won it wasn't great but we won, nicely played by pulisic and Gallagher.",Only thing to complain about is the late post match thread today 😁,Everyone here sucks. Potter has been in charge a week and we can definitely still get out the groups. Fucking chill everyone.,"Milan got absolutely outmanned for 90minutes today

We just dominated them and moved the ball with such purpose",The milan sub is such a gold mine lmao,,We are soft and easy to play against we have no nasty players anymore since Rudi left that’s as such a big mistake!!!,We sure Pogba didn’t hire that witch doctor to curse Mendy too? What the hell is up with that guy,"Kepa motm hands down, what a performance",This is the best RLC has looked in years.,Loving how passionate Tuchel. I would really recommend you guys watch the post match interview with him. I really felt it when he says he's sorry for the players couldn't deliver the win the team deserves. Damn I love this guy. I wish he can be a legacy like Alex Ferguson is for MU.,"Leeds were just better than us... in every facet of the game. I didn't see a single player rise to the challenge and really work their socks off 100%. Contrast it to leeds to who just outworked us to a man. 

Jorginho was absolutely garbage today. Without Kante or Kovacic available we needed him to stand up. Instead he went totally missing ."
36,"The manager needs to go. That was fucking embarrassing. He’s not putting a single player in position to do what they’re good at. Reece James is just a passenger right back now?!?! We need to win some fucking games. Go back to what where good at, play a back 3 and let chilly and Reece run wild at wingback. It gives Enzo more cover too. Just ridiculous how bad Potter has been, there’s no way we reach the ambitious heights of this project with this guy calling the shots.","We really did absolute insane performance tonight, we shouldnt have parked the bus after 2:0 but still lets gooo

Get Felix a fucking contract bro",Last 10 felt like I was watching champions league final 😭,This is shambolic. This is the club that sacked Ancelotti IN THE TUNNEL for finishing 2nd. Sacked Tuchel for not texting on WhatsApp. How have our standards dropped so much that we have unlimited patience for Potter's bullshit?,"Mudryk touch is honestly shocking, havertz what does he even do seriously.

Overall promising so unlucky","Enzo did a great first half until Fullham started to nullify him, that left Connor with way more room though.

I liked Madueke a lot, there are a few things to improve, but he was more dangerous than Ziyech

Harvetz in his natural position was a delight to the eye

An interesting debut for DD Fofana, a step up from Auba imo",We’re so boring.,Potter is about to design the whole fucking system around Mudryk,"First thing I’ll say is I’m in no way shape or form a Potter fan. I thought sacking Tuchel was a massive mistake and that Potter is no where near the caliber of coach that Tuchel is. That being said you can’t sack Potter, you have to give him the time to adjust and improve. You have to give him an opportunity to prove people like me wrong. Personally I think we are in for some very shitty days with our current squad and the injuries we currently have,but you have to give him time.",I'd love to know why our players refuse to play the ball forward. Fofana had some good runs in the 2nd half and not once did anyone even attempt to play him in,"This is such a lightweight team. I can't wait for Potter to say ""The boys gave everything"" once again post match.",[deleted],The change in performance after James went off is so nerve wracking.,Can we have RLC as far from the starting midfield as possible? Thank you,"Really awful game of football to watch. I'm not potter out yet, and I recognise that we have deficiencies in the team, but we are playing far worse than we should be. I don't understand the line-up or tactics at all. Our pressing is terrible, teams cut through us so easily. We also can't play out from the back, and in attack we create absolutely nothing. 

Broja while having potential doesn't have the quality to lead chelsea. Gallagher also shouldn't be starting in a creative role. I don't understand why we aren't playing more technical and pacy players like sterling and pulisic to actually create some danger from out wide, instead of playing two midfielders there. 

I feel like a team of:

pulisic - auba/havertz - sterling

mount - jorgi - kova

cucu - kk - silva - azpi

is way more competitive than whatever we put out tonight.

On top of that I'm also concerned with the new ownership giving a 5 year £300,000 contract to KK at the age of 31, and buying cucurella for 65m. Even giving potter a 5 year contract was probably foolish (regardless of whether he does well). Chelsea looking grim at the moment.","This one is on Potter, came with a bad starting lineup , and then decided to let sterling play for fucking 60 mins.",Anyone blaming Kepa for the goal should be banned for life,feel like it would've been a different game is pulisic started over kai,"Finishing was poor again but I felt we looked more like scoring today than vs Arsenal.

Could care less about the Carabao Cup, so one less fixture in a post-WC week is honestly a blessing in disguise.

Mendy was good today and Hall honestly should be in the first team after today.","Barely rested any first team players before the weekend, important player injured, average performance, a bad night overall",Why are we allergic to playing through balls?,"Puli and Gallagher were excellent for most of their time, but the two lost some steam towards the end. I guess that’s what happen when you don’t start often. Sterling, Auba, and Havertz could’ve been better in the first half, I thought their linkup play was a little disorganized. They could’ve had like 3 or 4 goals if the goalie didn’t play like his life was on the line. But Havertz putting that banger top bins in the second half makes up for that. Glad to see he’s regaining his confidence.

Good win, tough environment. Very pleased with Potter so far. On to the next!","Outside of the mistake for the goal (massive but obviously), I thought Fofana was quite impressive. The whole team is still adjusting and settling though so I’m not too worried","Dammit I missed the second half. 

Can we stop hating our players before the match is over though? that live thread was a disgrace in the first half especially.",The game ended the moment we brought on Ziyech. I don't think I've ever seen a player in a Chelsea shirt put in two back-to-back 1/10 performances. Shambolic.,"We had 7 English players play tonight.

Trevor, Mount, RLC, Chilwell, James, Sterling, Gallagher","the salt on /r/soccer 

how are they saying that wasnt a pen. they are even celebrating reece's injury",,"Man, Tuchel might be the most stubborn manager i have seen.

Same style every match, underperforming havertz and jorginho every match. 

For striker target, tunnel vision on Auba who will barely solve anything for even next 6 months and then will be in same situation again. 

The 60m that he wants Gordon for can be used to get a striker better than Auba. But again, just stubborn....

Before the knights show up. It is possible to criticise and support someone at same time.",Fofana had a quietly brilliant game.,"Three points, Mount back on the scoresheet, Trev's streak continues and Kepa turns into a god.



All in all a great weekend if I do say so myself.",Ruben has been fantastic when he's been called upon. Fans need to appreciate him more,"if you take the ref out of the equation, the three standout moments of the match: Havertz showed life (but we need a little more, can’t miss point blank), Ruben Loftus-Cheek was sensational, and losing N’Golo Kante to probably torn hamstring is brutal, but Gallagher suddenly has his chance. i think we need to try Pulisic or Broja in place of Havertz, just one game and see what happens.",[deleted]
37,#PotterOut,"Hats off to potter, he got his tactics spot on today. Brilliant performance all around. ALL the pressure was set up against him and the players today and this was a season defining game for the club and a career defining game for Potter. EVERYTHING was going against us for first 40min and then raz with a moment of magic unlocks the whole game. I have nothing but love for Kai, such a big game player and the cool to take 2 penalties, my god. This position suits him more and more with each game, he plays essentially like an 8 at times and his hold up play really unlocked Raheem. cucu, k2 and Wes were a brilliant backline and I had no worries at all. Kepa was brilliant and solid as well. Reece proving why he’s the best WB in the world. So many positives today really, I can't pick out a player who didn't play with their heart today. Kova and enzo held their cool despite being pressed hard. Gallagher changed dynamic completely and really showed us today why he should be starting over mount, conor offers devilish amount of energy out of possession.

I’m lost for words and so proud of everyone and first and foremost I’m happy for Potter. He has deserved criticism but he got it right today and players showed grit and you could SEE they were playing for him and we had a clear game plan. Let’s keep this momentum going. COYB!",Gotta be a gritty win to break a slump. Hopefully we can build and improve,Also Potter losing to a managerless Southampton side proves he’s adding no value as manager.,"A very frustrating and very unlucky match. A few inches and we'd have won that 2-1. 

Positives:
Kouli played well 

RLC and Enzo look like a good combo. RLC still suffers from the odd case of Barkley brain going forward, but he played well tonight. 
Felix in the first half. 

Negatives:
Mudryk had a poor game. He gave the ball away carelessly, and consistently made poor decisions in the final third.","I can’t be the only one who thinks Fofana should start up front from here on out. Give me Mudryk, Noni, Felix alongside him.","How about a Luke-warm take? I don’t think we should fire Potter this season unless we are about to get relegated. But I understand why so many fans don’t like him. Compared to Tuchel, Potter seems like a plain piece of toast. I hope he does a good job, but if these results continue to next season, 99% of our fanbase will be calling for the sacking, deservedly so.","1 point is better then nothing.

Subs were right too apart from Mount he should have been sub off earlier.

And our attacker needs to hit it first time again missed 3 big Chances you can't keep missing big chances and expect to win the match.

And again our new attacker looks miles better then any attacker we have shows our poor recrument in previous years.

Ziyech is my man of the match impressed with his performance yet again he was everywhere.

Can't wait for our fully fit squad especially James and felix combination think other teams will struggle too stop our front 3 noni,felix,mardyk.","Are we disappointed? Yes. Are we frustrated? Yes. Are we this seasons laughingstock? Absolutely. 

Do we lose hope? Nah. 

This is a throw away season. Happens to most teams once in a while. Watch United, Liverpool, and Arsenal in recent years. We have serious problems on all levels that must be address. I’m not convinced it’ll be with this manager or this squad, but we’ll bounce back eventually. And I’ll never stop believing that.",Downhill since winning the Champions League.,"We've only avoided defeat 3 times Under Potter were Kepa was not our highest rated player.

Joke of a manager.","Alright performance, again held back by inadequacies in the squad.

It was nice to see some youngsters get minutes. Hopefully pushes Potter to drop the ""regulars"" and experiment more. We looked miles better than we ever do with the likes of Pulisic, Mount and Sterling on the pitch.


Think Hall, Havertz and Zakaria warrant starts next game. Weren't amazing, but with the wank squad we have its deserving of more minutes.

Also, game justified Enzo's price tag completely.","Really encouraging game. They consistently broke the bournemoth line. Should have had a few more. Missed penalty or if you're not calling small contact you don't call the Kai push that resulted in a goal. Oddly reff'd game, but that's kind of par for the course in the PL.   
Hope Reece is OK-- Mount is MOtM for me. Kai, Sterling and Pulisic together with Mount behind created a lot of problems for their defense. Would love to see more of that lineup and formation...","We’re so shit, literally see why Tuchel played the way he did. Need a rebuild again. No running or hunger for the ball …. It’s a fucking derby fucking run your dick off and kick someone for fucksake. Embarrassing. Bring on the World Cup already. Already know we’ve lost 8-0 to city.",I am glad the World Cup has arrived now I don’t have to be depressed for 90 minutes twice a week we just don’t have it in us we will be lucky to finish in a Europa league spot with how terrible we have played this month hard to watch really no spark at all,"Gonna be rational instead of the “fuck x player get them out of this club” I’m sure there’ll be a lot of those.

- Sterling and Pulisic as wing backs is a waste of their talents, we certainly didn’t buy them for their ability out there. I trusted Potter before the match but I just can’t understand that.

- Silva wasn’t 100% and it showed, obviously we didn’t have much of a choice but to play him but he still needs a rest.

- why does it seem like no matter who the manager or players are, there’s just no connection between our midfield and our forwards?

- Hospital FC is back on the menu boys. Hopefully Kepa’s not down a while

- This is why we needed RB cover in the transfer window. Azpi isn’t cut out for it and Puli just isn’t good there. The only player who’s done well for us there is RLC but with midfield injuries he’s needed there.

Disappointing game from start to finish. Onto the next one",lol at the FK they won that they took 10-15 yards from the foul and almost positive the ball was rolling but need a replay,"Love RLC but he's definitely not a crosser. Just couldn't get one through. 


Man I miss Reece...",Please give Hall more game time,"Heart goes out to chilly, man fuck these injuries",Not quite the result I wanted on my birthday I can’t lie,"Bit of a clench at the end, but that’s mainly due to lack of height in the team. Some thoughts
- Kova is just insane. We immediately lost control when he was subbed off
- I love Gallagher and Pulisic playing together. So much energy and always looking to move the ball forward. Want to see them play more together
- Sterling was pretty average. Playing him at wingback is not helping anyone
- Thiago is GOAT. Although their goal was kinda his fault","It took a while for us to warm up which is to be expected with a new coach and an international break.  
I could immediately see a difference in how we play though, much more proactive and progressive. Jorginho was playing forward passes consistently, you could tell one of the instructions was to play those through balls fast and early.  
Aside from the mistake in the first half Fofana was excellent, on another day Mount gets 2 or 3 goals.  
Silva was immense, all our play started with him. He's going to ne very hard to replace.  
Kepa was brilliant, handled the long distance shots and crosses with ease and was excellent with his distribution. I hope he remains our number 1.  
Chilwell was rusty but came good in the 2nd half.  
Aubameyang and Havertz play really well together and Pulisic looked excellent in his cameo.  
Aubameyang just knows where the goal is, he's gonna do really good under Potter.  
Gallagher's finish was brilliant, just had to be him didn't it.",Why is no one talking about how great Kepa played,"I know the performances don't merit much but why is the stadium so dead for majority of the match. Fans are pin drop silent unless the ball is in oppositions half. No energy from fans will just pass into the team. 

Plus a lot of hate for Ziyech who seems to me at least trying despite nothing working. Hounding him if it doesn’t work won’t help confidence. He’s getting into position, trying to get past a man etc things we’ve missed.","First match since Spurs that I felt good and confident watching the team the whole way through, and against a strong opponent to boot (though Milan is hit with injuries). RLC is magnificent today, if not for Reece being Reece he would be my MOTM.",I’ starting to hate champions league every time we play a big match someone get injured,,We were outclassed practically man for man today. Really concerning stuff..,"Start Chilwell,

Cucurella can be great depth for LWB and LCB but Chilwell provides so much more attacking threat, and when our attackers are struggling to score we need every threat we can get","I’m not going to have a deep analysis on how this game went, and I’m gonna keep it short and simple 

#How in the living fuck did we not concede a goal and win??????","Fucking hell, what an incredible match that was. We showed some absolutely immense fight there, brilliant performances from everyone not called Gallagher.

Thiago Silva is Benjamin Button's cousin, it's mind-boggling how good he is at his age.

Sterling with a brilliant second half, hopefully he can build on this and start scoring regularly. I thought Havertz was also really good today, especially in the little hold-up moments he had.","How VAR doesn't send the ref for a second look is outlandish. 

Havertz played much better despite the miss. The team needs more time to click, but this lineup will be deadly in the future. 

Cucu was good but there was a cross from Sterling that Alonso buries any day against the Spurs. 

At the end, the finishing is still the thing we have to figure out. So many wasted opportunities.","Why on earth does this coach, with these players, with this inept attack, think it would be bad to sign Ronaldo?  We are so toothless up front it'll be a struggle to secure 4th place this year, because Arsenal does not appear to be messing around this time out (yes I know, it's Arsenal, and they'll fold, I'm just venting....)  JUST SIGN RONALDO BECAUSE NO ONE ON THIS TEAM WILL BE GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR THE 20 GOALS HE'D PRODUCE."
38,"I cannot defend him anymore. Potter you need to resign, you are so out of your depth","Positives:

The win 

2 goals scored 

The team showed a bit of fight/physicality

Some individual performances (Havertz/ Cucarella)

Negatives:

Too many chances missed throughout the match

Too negative towards the end 


Overall, happy with the win and performance. Hopefully another improvement against Leicester","koulibaly was great today, blocked a lot of crucial shots, intercepted balls, and had a good connection with fofana",**Potter OUT**,"Mudryk had a cold, Cucurella doesn’t pass to him, now it’s Mudryk isn’t match fit smh. Felix is Forreal though, heavily impressed with him","Mount has to fucking go, is he even a professional footballer? Like come on man.","Looked forward to this match and the last match against Fulham excited like a kid on Christmas, but my joy has been fucking killed. 

I don’t understand why Mudryk was taken off when he started to get going in the game and why Datro Fofana wasn’t given a chance to come on a lot earlier when he looked like a big threat last game. Mount and Ziyech substitutions killed the flow of the game. Chillwell needs to start next game","All the ""neutrals"" over in r/soccer are saying it's a boring game, but for me, I thoroughly enjoyed it, our midfield, our pressing, our ""tiki-taka"" were at times, fantastic! We had a clear plan to draw pool forward and then to break the press either with a long ball to Havertz or out wide to Ziyech and later on, Mudryk.

Cucurella was much improved, Chalobah was great with some good play, even Mount and Gallagher played their positions well, marshalling Thiago and Keita negating their midfield.

The new signings have obviously lifted team morale and we are playing much better.

Onwards and upwards!","In 13 years as fan, I have never been against any manager because obviously there's circumstances in each loss and sack, and we have been blessed with great players and administrative regime. 

However, I must say Potter looks completely out of touch with anything a top football club seeks and maybe should have gotten 1-2 more seasons elsewhere before coming to Chelsea. We can't continue like this. It's clear players have given up on him, similarly they did to Conte and Lamps. We'll have to wait and see who our owners really are.","I mean we need James, Chillwell and Kante back desperately. 

Auba was a joke of a signing so Fofana needs to hit the ground running now. If he doesn’t we have to play the rest of this season basically without a striker. I also think we desperately need another CM good enough to come into our starting 11 this January. 

Koulibaly was a bad signing too, clearly on the decline and a downgrade from Rudiger. We will need to sign another CB soon too. Silva is too old to carry us much longer. I don’t think anyone we signed in the summer actually improved our starting 11. Probably why Tuchel didn’t want it anymore.",Potter doing a great job of Chelsea - same as Brighton. Came into the club and made us a mid table team.,I can't get my head around the Cucurella signing.,"I see now why I enjoyed the World Cup so much. They had competent referees. If this was a World Cup game the score would be 4-0 by Halftime.

Atrocious referring performance denying us a legitimate penalty and then calling off a good goal. 

Once again English refs prove to be as useful as a glass hammer.","An average squad with now, an an average manager. LOTS of work to do.","Another bad performance, but I'm still supporting Potter. He hasn't really had time to work his ideas into the squad and he is also missing James/kante.

Hopefully we can change something during the transfer window. What I want is a DM and an attacker that dares to dribble. We really need to start bossing the midfield again.","Todd father should have hired the recruitment team first before making these signings. The Cucu signing is akin to throwing money down the drain. Our entire defence is injured.
Lineup was poor. Puli and Sterling as WBs when you have a depleted back line. Potter now manages a top tier club and must get his act together.",Typical Chels,"Impressed by Carnie(?), Puli, Kova and Kepa today. Also shoutout Trevoh, solid performance from him. Didn’t like Potters subs & Broja was a bit too zealous today, just needed to calm his nerves on one or two occasions and we might’ve walked away with 3 points.",Come with that same energy & we can get a win against Newcastle!,"Heart goes out to chilly, man fuck these injuries","Mason, Ziyech, KK had absolute stinkers. Jorgi misplaced so many passes it was actually impressive. 

Happy for Kepa I suppose.",Can someone explain to me why commentary can’t stand pulisic? Like you can twist havertz goal to be whatever you want it to be. They say oh that’s pulisic’s assist and you hear one of the commentators says “that’s not an assist not in my book”. Like why can’t they just give dude his credit. He hasn’t been unbelievable I agree but shit he beat 3 defenders played a good ball in and made a great run. Havertz could’ve slipped him back and it could’ve been a goal. Havertz finish was unreal. This has nothing to do with him. Just don’t get all the hate.,Second half was MUCH better. Think once we build some more chemistry we’re on the right path,My god passing sideways to passing forward fc…hmm what could go wrong?,"We didn’t deserve to win, plain and simple. We had 1 (ONE) shot on target in 80 minutes.","Really happy for Kepa, hoping he keeps the no1 Jersey from Mendy for a little while longer at least. Also happy for Aubamayang, we need a striker that even though they aren't in the game can finish in a moments notice, we haven't had that since Costa!",Wanted 5-0 but I'll take it,,"I don't know what's going on at the club atm. I really don't. We look fucking shocking. We look all over the place, the first 25 minutes we looked decent, some good combinations and some chances. We score a goal and then completely crumble, no wonder we concede 2 when we fucking crumble against a midtable side. What the fuck was that second half? That has got to be one of the worst halves I've ever seen us play. We were all over the place, didn't create a single clear cut chance for 45 mins. They were literally dominating us up until the 80th minute or so. Had it not been for Thiago Silva, we probably would've lost 4-1/5-1. It was that bad. The players look spineless, the mentality is so freaking bad, everytime we concede it's like we think it's already over. There's no fucking winning mentality in this squad atm. Onto other things, it's just so freaking clear we need a midfielder, so why have we spent 2 months of the transfer window waiting to see if FDJ will come. Why have we not accepted that he won't fucking come and just moved on to another CM target. The recruitment at this club needs to change and it's so abundantly clear.  We so desperately need RB/RWB cover because we can't expect James to be 100% every game, so why haven't we looked for one? It's certainly a very bad situation when we're having to put Pulisic at RWB? Why why why? No wonder he looked shite, he's a forward being played as a defender. Why are we playing players so often out of position? Havertz at CF, he's been woeful for months at that position, but Tuchel keeps starting him and putting him there. Mount is not a winger ffs, he's a central midfielder, stop playing him at winger. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying Tuchel out, but fuck me this looks really really bad. I wouldn't be surprised if we finish 6th or 7th at this point. City look great as usual, Liverpool are Liverpool, they will always come back, Arsenal look great, Spurs get the results they need, Man Utd have 2 wins in a row( one against Southampton), that's 5 teams, and teams like Newcastle and Brighton (I know they lost today but still) look good this year. 

I might be a bit reactionary but to say this isn't an alarming situation is just baffling.",Absolutely fucking dead performance until chilly saved us. Mendy needs to benched and koulibaly should also be benched if we play a 4atb. Tuchel is seriously on fraud watch atm,"
I’m glad to get the three points, but this was an ugly match. Villa gifted us two goals and luckily mount took advantage. Kepa motm really bailed us out.

I think we need to accept that the three at the back just doesn’t work without James. It doesn’t matter who we try to shoehorn there. Nobody can perform that role anywhere near his level. We just end up sacrificing the attack and we’re not getting any extra defensive stability because our midfield just gets pressed out of the game. 

I don’t understand why we didn’t set up similarly to the wolves match. We got good performances all around. Hope we go back to it.",This is gonna be another roller coaster season isn’t it guys,"Chelsea needs to finish their opportunities and put these games away. Should have score 3+.       
The Prem needs to address the Anthony Taylor situation. This is pathetic and infuriating",Mount has been very poor in this season until now

The week is saved.",GET IN CHELSEA,We shit on the Connor sub but he actually did fine after the first few minutes. Noni looked good as well.,Sacking Tuchel still is a baffling decision,"Those two crosses at the end by Cucurella legit set a new standard for how shit he can be. My word I though Alonso was a terrible crosser.

Cucurella is easily one of the worst five signings we’ve ever made",Mount is absolutely shit.,"We should of been able to put the game away in the first 20 minutes. Complete breakdown on the goal against. Cucu looked dreadful. We somehow managed to look worse with subs. Absolutely robbed by VAR. Potter is probably happy with the effort though. 2 wins in 13 is not enough for Chelsea, I do not care about the context. Lots of clubs have injury problems. We are in bloody 9th with lower table clubs having games in hand. We didn't even get a shot in the second half, and this is against a team fighting relegation. Potter just sits there with absolutely no passion as we're robbed in stoppage time by the refs. I cannot forgive this club for sacking Tuchel.",Please just shoot the ball.,We win that game if not for the red.,No more waiting for havertz to figure it out. He needs to rejoin Werner back in Germany,"We need to move on from Jorginho and Kovacic’s midfield philosophy. Too weak, not creative enough. Never going to come close to a league without some more energy and quality.","Just play the youngsters, Zakaria and Thiago Silva.

Simples.","One injury free game is all I ask for, will never happen","Man this is really painful, I was watching a highlight from our title win with Conte. Night and day difference between this team. I never saw us falling off this badly. We’re in trouble.","We had a lot more bite in the second half, Hall put in another good shift, promising player, and Pulisic looked direct and at least tried to be dangerous and to be fair as a team we also had a few bouts of what I think Potter is trying to do with our football, quick passing to break down lines, but again I'm seeing us unsettled by a high press, fail to show quality in the midfield and fail to finish when it matters. But we create such low quality chances too.

Very poor game by Kova for his standards. We need James and someone fast in the back like Fofana real bad. See yall after the WC.","New manager bounce is over. Come on Potter, time to step up. Top 4 race again, sigh.","Thats what u get for defending like that in the end, throwing the ball back to the opponent",should buy vini jr so we can convert him to a wingback as well.,"Borja’s lack opportunities to score come directly from his terrible positioning. Hall and Pulisic missed their chances, but they were is position to have those chances. Anytime we came remotely close to scoring, Broja was nowhere to be found.",Chilly injury makes the entire game a waste of time unfortunately. We didn’t come out of that ahead despite the scoreline. Zakaria also needs to be given more minutes in the league,"But seriously, I want to know what do we do in training?","People may disagree and say that Potter's wingbacks are different and what not, but Puli and Sterling have to start way too far back in the attack. Those guys should be as close to the goal as possible. Sterling has looked pretty bad every time he plays there, and Puli was decent today, but I feel they are not being used to their strengths at all.","That match thread was a whole new level of toxicity, my days you lot are savage 😂","Really good stuff from Mount, Azpi, Gallagher, and Pulisic today.  

Great to see Broja get on the scoresheet as well.  Good performance! Hopefully it can be replicated against Milan again midweek.

KTBFFH!","It isn't the worst possible outcome for the first match.

Pitiful,"If there's 1 take away, it's that the midfielders just have no creativity. We struggled almost all game to pass through to the attackers. Not helped by not having a presence up front, but City wouldn't be struggling like we are against these low blocks.

I'm hoping Zakaria can be the thing to move us away from 3 CB's. Having more bodies forward should help our uncreative midfield to at least get the ball into the forwards more often.","Kepa MOTM with Mount a solid second. 

Lucky Chillwell wasn't sent off and for the gifts from Villa. 

This match showed how poor RLC can be when the opponent's midfield plays with any sort of intensity. The team selection was also shocking, playing our best asking player at right back made no sense.",Sterling 👏,Glad Tuchel is addressing Anthony Taylor,"Major rant incoming.  


Jorginho without doubt is atrocious and a liability. The amount of people on this sub that have concluded he's a great player is abysmal. Can they not see the obvious? We completely got overrun in the game. J5 does not work in any midfield pairing that is not Kante or Kovacic, these 2 are complete work horses and cover so much ground to hide J5's glaring deficiencies, it's a double edged blade. They work so hard to cover him they constantly get muscles injuries and stay on the sideline then we can never move on from Jorginho. To the people saying we should move on Kante and keep J5 I pray your eyes open finally and see what everyone else sees.  


Havertz is so average. He really offers nothing to the game, he's not a finisher/poacher or creative. This results in him ghosting through the game having no impact. However people love that he 'presses', which is hilarious. We win back the ball so he can do nothing with it? I wish we kept Timo, he was always a threat and popped up in dangers areas, with him there was always a 'chance' in the game. How does Havertz play 90 minutes this game? Also it's hilarious how the pro-Havertz group on this sub are flip-flopping their position on him, 1 minute its give him a chance as a ST, now its he's not a ST and is playing out of position. Maybe it's time to accept what your eyes see and that he's not this super-generational talent that's going to be better than De Bruyne.  


Mendy is a good keeper but not for this type of team. When we were getting blitzed by shots his saving ability was fantastic but now that we try to progress our style and play with possession it really shows how bad he is on the ball. Pickford got an assist yesterday with an amazing 60 yard pass, Mendy can barely kick it to a guy 25 yards away without looking shaky.

  
What's most frustrating is that Tuchel does not learn. Next game we are starting Mendy, J5 and Havertz."

He is strong, aggressive, and with decent tackling. 
If he can play like this I think he should be starting more games.

You can say trust the process all you want but at the end of the day if Potter doesn't get us top 4 then the plan goes out the window without the money and appeal of UCL.

1. Koulibaly was awful. He has not adapted to the intensity of the EPL and at his age he won't adapt any time soon.

2. Love Dave but honestly not good enough. When Reece doesn't play it is noticeable how fewer chances we create and how more vulnerable we look.

3. Potter not noticing that (in my opinion) Jorginho should have been replaced instead of Zakaria is mind-boggling.

4. Sterling was TERRIBLE. Goal or no goal.

5. Aubameyang doesn't look interested.

6. I don't thing Ziyech should start and I do think Cucurella isn't world class. Although they get a lot of stick at least there was some effort from them today. Doesn't mean I want them in the team but they weren't as bad as 1-5 above.

7. Carney sub was WAY too late. Whoever thinks a sub in the last 5 mins is a good idea is ridiculous. Takes 5 mins to get into a game in all seriousness, especially for someone who doesn't regularly start.

8. I had written him off, but Kepa was solid.

9. Kovacic and Gallagher had some energy at least. That should be the MINIMUM for every player.

10. I have berrated him and I don't think he should be a starter but Pulisic was good.

Looking at the content there is nothing, nothing at all. Obviously Potter wasn't going to change everything in 2 months, but all I can see is regression on all the fronts, players form, schemes, strategies, fighting spirit, everything has broken.

He said he feels it pretty strong, so not good.""

(@ChelseaFC)

This sucks. Obviously we need another midfielder but Kante was so good today.","Cucu was very bad today, no good passes, so many turnovers from him, fault for the third goal. How can someone look at the third goal and say he will be a great CB, same was with Spurs equalizer, while his man didn't score in that one, he was just standing and let his man run away.

And don't go blastic on me, because I know he is great FB, I am talking about him as a LCB which we think he can help us with, no he can't, simple as that, and him being a great FB doesn't remain that good a point when you remember we already have one. We should have got a proper CB instead, in long term this is gonna bite us. Suddenly wothout KK if we get injury to Silva, who is our CBs? Just Fofana? Levi would have been needed here, he is a better LCB than Cucu everyday, even on his worst days.

Should have also wrapped Kounde at the start and wouldn't have to restrict his qualities by playing him RCB. You guys are telling me, Reece-Silva-Cucu backine is good? They will get eaten up. And if we go Azpi-Silva-Cucu they are all small. 60m on Cucu was a fucking waste of money, and not because player is bad but because what we want from him will leave him in tough spot without using his abilities and there will be problems too among 2 top LBs in the future. Blind move.

80m on FDJ will be even more atrocious, we need physicslly better guy in the middle, how can anyone think Jorgi and FDJ will be a great midfield pairing. SMS or Rice is needed. If we get FDJ we will have one more player who we will have to cover for, in PL he will get exploited. Please stop chasing FDJ he doesn't even want to move, we need a midfielder, go for SMS this window and Rice next season.

We also do not need more pressures up front, we need talents, Neymar rather than Gordon, pr players at that level. We desperately need a Hazard-esque dribbler to relieve pressure and cut through the defense.

I am not raging or overteacting, after a mistake like Mendy did, teams get results like this as it disheartend the team, so I know we will be better next game, but above points are fully valid. Also we should have had more that  defender signed by now, you can excuse the window all you want but if KK wasn't in last year we would have no CBs by now. Hope we don't panic and get Magurie now."

Madueke needs time. Fofana is going to need a lot of time. I’ll give you Mount looked bad today tho.,"Will be lost in the thread probably but what's most bizarre to me is the total lack of any tactical influence on the team. Almost all high level coaches have a system or style they believe in and want to implement, be it pep or sean dyche or thomas frank. But Graham Potter has changed or implemented absolutely nothing. There's no instructions or method to the build-up, there is no counterpress, no clue when the fullbacks are supposed to overlap and when to invert, it's just like they've been thrown out there to do whatever. If it's Lampard or Gerrard it's understandable because they've gotten big jobs on name alone but Potter made his name for his tactics. He's supposed to be one of the key figures in the new generation of young English coaches that are expected to match and compete with the rest of elite European coaching talent. I am more than happy to give those coaches time that are training their squad to play their way, and Graham Potter isn't one them.",Mudryk had a few poor touches but wow on the whole he looked really good. He seemed on another level compared to our other attackers.,I do hope Felix will help people to see just how fucking terrible our attack is.

First time in 25 years I’ve felt this way.,"Koulibaly is awful & Azpi’s time is up unfortunately.

I have massive questions about targeting Leao this summer. Our best performances all season were against the reigning Seria A champs, meanwhile Koulibaly was “World class”, Lukaku a Player of the Season, & Lautaro Martínez startable over there. Not to mention a Stoke reject is 2nd in scoring this season. Are we sure that leagues even stronger than Ligue 1?

At least Cucurella has found his feet.",Cucurella might be the worst signing of the summer,"Definite signs of improvement, our attackers were linking up really well, still missing that killer instinct to put teams to the sword though. Hopefully it isn't too serious with Reece, he walked off on his own feet so fingers crossed he'll not miss much.","So uninspiring. Spineless, gutless soulless. 

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Havertz is not up to scratch. If Bayern come in with any sort of bid for him we need to take it and run before they have second thoughts. 

We need a new RB/RWB. I love Dave but his boat has long sailed and he should not be used in games such as this. 

Cucu was average yet again. We need to genuinely think about LB this summer if this form continues and chilwell continues to be this injury prone.

Zero midfield creativity, but it’s hard to be creative when the midfield doesn’t even exist. It was absolutely non existent today. 

Sterling poor once more. Dunno what needs to be done but the boy needs to get hypnotherapy at the bare minimum. 

Can’t really fault auba. No service at all and when he got into the positions he wasn’t found. Simple as that.

Best signing Tuchel pushed for this summer.","A good performance, and you could tell that we were a bit low on confidence at the start with some heavy touches and misplaced passes, but Thiago's goal settled us down (the man is an absolute god), and we were able to kick on. You get the sense that our recent habit of conceding early plays on the mind's of the players and brings a degree of tension to our early play.

I think having a physical and mobile midfielder in Loftus-Cheek showed us that we need a foil to Kovacic/Joginho - the team felt a lot more elastic with him in there, in the same way that Kante influences the team (although of course without the elite anticipation that Kante has). The transition from defense to attack felt a lot better today.

Reece James showed his immense quality, both in defense and attack. Alonso was the only one who could strike a ball as cleanly as him, and he stands head and shoulders above our specialist attacking players when he's through on goal. Also glad to see Chilwell play the full 90 - he seems to be getting back to full fitness and making those darting runs that made him so dangerous in the first half of last season.

A good win, and the next step is consolidate it at the weekend.",Great day for an Irish Chelsea fan! Irish women in the world cup as well 😎,,This is possibly the worst I've seen Chelsea play in quite sometimes. The score don't reflect but it was more frustrating than the Leeds game.,Love a good bit of Karma. Antonio should’ve been sent off before he scored so i’ll gladly take that. Mendy is having a shocker of a season though,I don’t wanna hear kepa slander from here on out.,Mason Mount played today?,FUCK ANTHONY FUCKING CUNT ASS BITCH TAYLOR,Crazy that I saw a post on this sub earlier this week saying Tuchel shouldn't target FDJ because it may impact Gallagher who can't play in a pivot or create chances.
45,Surely that's it for Potter? Right?,"POTTER IN!!! HAVERTZ IN!!! CUCU IN!!!

Never doubted them for a second…",Defenders FC is back!,Alright I've been behind Potter since he got appointed. I've given him the benefit of the doubt. I've tried trusting the process but unfortunately there is no process. I don't care about the xG or the possession stats or the number of goals we score or how attractive we play. I just want a win. I don't like beating the Tuchel drum over and over again because he's gone for good but is anyone going to tell me that Tuchel wouldn't have done better than Potter in the last 4 months? I think even without the signings in January we would have ended up with more points if a manager of his calibre was in charge.,We played really well today. Finishing off but let’s build on the performance. Can see so quality players out there just not fully clicking atm.,What a load of shit,"Frustrating result, but I did feel our attack improved in the first half. That’s even with Mudryk being mostly wasted cuz Cucu just won’t swing the rock for some fucking reason.

Let’s see how we go against Dortmund midweek.",how many shockers does mount need to put it to get him benched lol,"I thought we were coming into the game a little bit after the first half and when you’re in bad form you just need a bit of luck. Not this season. That injury/ red card combo was brutal. This season has already been ridiculous and our squad just got substantially weaker going into next week. Honestly just need Silva to take a knock now and our entire starting 11 would be out.

Even with that we created enough chances, if we had a striker on the pitch who knows. And both the goals we conceded were so avoidable. This season is cursed.","Last year we were playing a Carabao final and cwc. Jesus Christ, never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined it would come to this.","We are complete garbage and this is unacceptable, but yet again, where in the world is VAR in our games????",Not even mad tbh City still in the title race and we actually showed some good play and fight,It's mad how James affects this team. Soon as he is gone the team just instantly loses so much threat but also lose so much confidence.,"I bet RLC gonna start again next game, i have no faith in Potter.",Why the fuck did we let Werner go? Honestly feels like boehly bought into all the memes bullshit and shipped him. Definitely wasn't a smart football decision.,"stop

That fixes 99% of our fucking problems.",That’s now four points thrown away at home against top 6 sides.,"Every single attack today the wrong choice was made lol literally every single one the main culprit being havertz who I swear lost the ball 9 times out of 10 he had it and RLC killed most of our attacks from the right side. We played awful football again today, Brentford had the better chances and should have scored if it wasn’t for Kepa this is very worrying we don’t look like scoring or creating chances and we are shipping them at the other end we are just lucky we have an Inform goalkeeper.",Glad to see pulisic at least he adds something to the attack. He can’t finish but being able to create chances is better than nothing because if you create enough maybe someone can score.  Koulibaly could have done his job and tried jumping but instead let a goal in and was slow to react later on.  We should stop trying to find someone on the team who can score and just worry about creating chances and just hope the goals will come.,"I'm so tired of all these injuries man. Wake me up if it's no more than 2 weeks, otherwise let me sleep.",Im tired.,"~~1st place~~ Qualification officially secured and 1st place 90% certain, hopefully we’ll see Broja, Chukwuemeka, Casadei, Zakaria etc get major minutes vs Zagreb","Not counting the corners, Puli was “in” for 3 minutes and set up Gallagher for a screamer OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. This is what we need.",Not sure how Potter has got these guys to play this way in the space of 3 games but it’s damn good to watch. Wolves gave us all day and left so many holes but I’ve never seen us play that many forward passes for years. They’re never going to lose their talent but this is the first time they’ve been instructed to play like this for a long time,"Let's be honest here, where was the fight in Kai Havertz tonight? New lease of life under a new manager, time to turn it up against weaker opposition,  at home, what else does he need?? Don't care if he turns good elsewhere if he's not done it with us this season he needs to be sold. I'd take Trossard ahead of this buck as we now he can actually perform with this manager.",What is that Chalobah rating? He was class.,Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,,"Hate to say this but this dip on the form is on Tuchel. The players are playing exactly like the end of Lampard era. No passion, just few individuals trying to gather and play some ball.","Will always take the three points no matter how they came, but in no world did we deserve all three points today.","Sometime in the not so distant future when memories aren't as great and we pick a a few losses, people will look back on this period and say how defensively sound we were ""back when when Potter first took over"" because of the scorelines we've had. If you watched the match today, you know we still have work to do. 

This sounds like I'm complaining but I'm not. Very happy with 3 points.",Anyone else notice the RLC-James link up? Some of their one-touch passing was mesmerizing,"Well, that was inevitable. Taylor, you  bald-headed prick.",We have to understand that the problem of the number 9 is complicated. We are so predictable offensively that it would be even worse with a target man.
46,Enough.,Fantastic from each and every player!,"I never wanted Potter out, but I don’t think defending 1-0 against Leeds in 3-6-1 formation is okay for Chelsea FC",Home support is absolutely fuming,"I only caught the 2nd half but I thought we looked pretty decent

So frustrating to see the same finishing issues show up","Waiting for Potter to say, “Trust the process.”",Top 4 is there for the taking but we are somehow shitting the bed every game. Sigh,"Mudryk looked really good, thought Havertz and Ziyech played well and Badiashile looks solid and calm in possession, shame he couldn't score that header. Cucurella had his best game for us I'd say too. Silva MOTM again is laughable at this point, what a beast.

Edit: Forgot about Jorgi somehow, he was immense too.

Thought Gallagher put in a shift but his quality on the ball let him down today, same with Mount. No idea what Aubameyang even offers though, rather have a tired Havertz at least he wins duels.

Shout out Azpi for 500 appearances. Legend.","It gets worse before it gets better.

KTBFFH.","Potter In. One, cause we deserve this after Tuchel. Two, can't expect much when even Tuchel couldn't get the best out of them. Firing Potter only buys these players more time. There isn't nothing much to say or do. Bite the bullet till the summer. Bring in Nkunku, CM, RB, striker. Let go of Auba and Jorgi. And start building from scratch.","Feels rare to watch a good Chelsea performance these days. And I don’t just mean this season, I mean for the better part of the last 5+ years. So often feeling like I just wasted my time after watching our matches. Did we even register a shot in that second half?","A 1-0 loss isn't a terrible result vs city but holy fuck is our team in trouble.

In my 20+ years as a Chelsea fan and 10 years on this sub I cannot remember a worse time for us.

We are in serious serious trouble","In review.  We deserved the win and clean sheet, no doubt.  Should've been 4-0, but Simon Hooper had an atrocious performance as a referee, and any team should cringe if they get this absolute clown 🤡  officiating their match from now on.  In any case, strong performance from the team, Pulisic, Sterling, and Havertz looked really good going forward.  And that was due, in no small part, to Mason Mount.  Ez MotM.  He was absolutely incredible!  Popping up all over the pitch, connecting the midfield to attack seamlessly.  Mount is just a different animal when he has a free license to affect the game.  I believe most of us on this sub already knew this, so there it is, and it was great to watch.  Zakaria and Jorgi looked solid in midfield, especially in the first half.  Didn't know shit about Zakaria when the club bought him, but he's definitely serviceable at this stage.  He's intelligent and has better than expected ability on the ball.  I am interested to see where that goes and how he grows and adapts going forward.  Cucu looked way more comfortable in the prototypical fullback role than as a wingback.  Shame what happened to James... I surely wasn't the only one shocked when I saw that he was starting.  Silver lining, he dud walk off on his own, not limping, so let's hope it's just a minor setback.  Silva showed his experience and ability in this last 15 min or so.  Kepa, nice work.  Koulibaly.. 😬 at times, should've scored the header, unlucky.  Let's give Potter some credit.  He's clearly been working on this.  (I know. That's his job), but the team looked a lot more cohesive, especially beating the press, going forward.  Theres still room for improvement, but were seeing the inklings of Potter's philosophy starting to take hold of the squad.  Lets see if they can build on it with another good performance against NFFC on the 1st.","I am absolutely shocked by Potter. 

RLC, Kai, and Sterling have looked ABYSMAL all year. Mount works harder, but has looked only slightly better (in all but 1 great game). Yet, they all continue to start ahead of players who come on hungry and make impacts when they get a chance. 

Zakaria just played a very gutsy performance last game or and is awarded with no minutes. 

Puli continues to look like our most threatening attacker and waits week after week for scraps behind Kai and Sterling.

I'm genuinely furious.

At this point, we are fucked with the injuries we have. When it comes to key stat predictors, we are middle table all the way. 

The rest of the season must be used to evaluate which players to keep, loan, and sell imo. And you aren't going to do that by playing the same underperformers week in and out.",What was Potter cooking?,"We are not getting top 4 with this squad right now, no way. 

RLC wouldn't be good enough to start for about 14/15 teams in the league. 

Potter you needed that humbling today with that trainwreck of a lineup.","This team is entirely dependent on 3 players
Silva James and Kante

When all 3 are running we can beat anybody
When 2 are running we look pretty good
When there’s 1 we barely hang on
When none are around it’s a disaster",Why did Reece have to get injured? WHY DAMNIT?!,"this is an off year, i’ve already accepted it",They talk about be careful with Chilwell and then he plays 94 minutes in a dead rubber when we have a game Sunday morning 🤦🏾‍♂️,"There was one point in the last 10 mins where i watched Havertz, Mount and Auba all make the exact same run into the box ontop of eachother. 

Anyone not blaming tuchel for this chaos/no plan attacking strategy is lost.","Good win, but my god we still lack finishing  Another squeaky bum finish in a game we should've won by 4.  

Guys need to start being more clinical.","Huge win for us not only got 3 points but it will lift our team for this huge month ahead.



Cons of this game.

Chilwell was s**t I can see last year's injury has affected the movement he struggled to run and was struggling to change directions.

Kovacic was also very very average. 

Jorginho was also getting bullied by CP midfield.

Sterling has a average game by his standards.

Pros of the game 

Huge 3 points.
This goal will give a huge boost to Gallagher 

Auba was looking sharp 

James was as always Excellent and didn't give any chance to Zaha.","3 points.
Clean sheet.
Havertz back on the score sheet.
Pulisic and Broja scoring their first goals of the season.

Another solid performance. What a week it's been💙",Europa League it is then,UP THE CHELS,"Don't care about the game, just want to know whether Reece is ok. Nothing else really matters. Fingers crossed.",,"Boehly needs to look long term, Tuchel might end up doing more damage if he gets his targets","Wtf is up with Anthony Barry these days? We are shocking on set pieces. 

Also, indefensible to not give Kepa even one start now. Mendy is shocking.","Great performance by Kepa and Mount.  


Chilwell was poor, had no effect on the game. Easily beaten again and again. On possession he shows no threat, creativity or weaker foot. He looks like he's not thinking on the ball.","Fuckin hell, this club is going to kill me.","Robbery, disgusting from Anthony Taylor. The man needs to be investigated 😂",When is everybody going to wake up and admit that we haven’t been in proper form since December 2021 ?
47,Sack Potter before we end up in Championship.,We are fucking Chelsea,"Gahhhh Arsenal had to go and take away some of the happiness. But whatever, it’s been way too long since we’ve scored a goal or gotten a win. It wasn’t a beaut but I’ll take it.","Potter doesn’t just deserve to be sacked. He deserves to have his coaching license removed for what he’s done at Chelsea. 

Before Potter I struggled to decide who the worst coach in the club’s history is, but there is no more debate. He’s managed that in just a couple months. That’s actually impressive if you think about it, to be this damn awful.",Unlucky to not win today,"Not the result we wanted but man it was a game that’s so frustrating. So many failed passes and lack of chemistry. Everyone was super eager to see all the new signings and they definitely were picking up the tempo. However, Badiashielle is silently the most impressive of the lot. That guys has been insanely impressive, he literally could be our next Azpi in that he just doesn’t get fazed in 1-1s. It really makes one wonder if we made a mistake not including him in the Champions league squad",Potter out immediately. I was for giving him time but there isn’t an ounce of progress. Dude is over his head. Where is the pattern of play!? There’s just nothing. We have plenty of talent but they are directionless. CuCu refused Mudryks existence for the entirety of their time on the pitch and Potter answers that by removing THE BOTH OF THEM? Wtf goes on in Potters mind? Dude is clueless as fuck. Ship him out and tape Marc to him while you’re at it,"Also, I will never get tired of havertz's work rate. Whatever is said about his attacking output, position in the team, etc...you can't question his work rate. Dude is a fantastic worker",So much for that emergency meeting with players,Utter rubbish. That's all,"Couldn’t we just play Chalobah at RB instead of Azpi, we didn’t even make any subs in the defence so it was doable.","I’m actually happy with the Blues today. The team looked energetic and we got some great performances out of quite a few players. That’s the best you can ask for given the circumstances. 

We are beyond a B-team at this point. We’ve got C-team players making regular appearances. When you have to rely on multiple teenagers to make a difference off the bench, that’s pretty telling how injured this team is. 

This is a comically injured team with a new owner, new manager, and a myriad of other organizational changes. Potter inherited a transitional team full of bad signings that he didn’t ask for. And not only did he save us from crashing out of the UCL, he has us playing some of our best football against the previous season’s champions. 

This season is pretty much a wash. All we can hope for is a bright performance in the UCL, and a strong vision that Potter, Bohely, and co. can use to move the club in a new direction.",Game was fun to watch initially but got depressing the moment James got injured :(,2 goals in the last 4 league games.  I need someone remind me how all of Chelsea's attacking woes were Tuchel's fault?,I wonder what Tommy is thinking right now,"4-3-3 
How Hard is that?","Honestly United were better. Trevor, Kepa and Kova kept us alive. Subs came a little late.",Kai should definitely warm the bench until the end of international break.,That time of year isn't it,"Heart goes out to chilly, man fuck these injuries","Sterlings best game overall was his first game. He's slowly gotten a little worse every game. Like all attackers...

Hmm",No way Pulisic was the worst player on the pitch.,"Lads, we actually won a game","3 players that crucially needed confidence boosting scored a goal today. I’m ecstatic!

Tremendous game all around!",Stand and applaud at the 21st minute until this team doesn’t fucking suck,"1. We have an obligation as a competitive football club to buy Leao before City sets their eyes on him.

2. People used to joke about having 10 Messis or 10 Ronaldos on the pitch, but honestly, every club should aspire to have 10 Reece James on the field and it's not a joke.",Haha Fuck Milan. Whiny annoying cunts i hope they go to Europa League,,"Honestly this might be the game where I seriously start directing questions at Tuchel.

Not a single part of our game after 20 minutes were up to standard. Broja and Kovacic looked pretty decent coming on...that's literally it.

Our players have limitations yes, but right now it feels like they can't even do the basics! Watch Brighton and watch how efficient they are, and the best part is they don't even do anything particularly insane. They just work with a great system that focuses on executing the core parts of successful football to perfection, to awesome effect.

We need to change something and change it fast. Kante and James being out is simply no excuse for our recent performances. I'm not expecting a title challenge, hell I'm not even expecting us to walk into top 4- but I at the very least want us to play attractive football like we did against Spurs. Watching Arsenal and watching us is fucking sobering at the moment man.

We can still turn the season around. It's not all doom and gloom yet. The first thing we MUST do however is have our manager and players acknowledge that this just isn't good enough. We'll move with the team from there.💙💙💙","If it was the other way around, West Ham fans would be laughing and using it to banter us so they can cry all they want",another clean sheet. lovely sunday!,"Havertz was an absolute menace in the second half, thought he played well all things considered.","Head and shoulders the better team today but hard to win when the refs are clearly paid off. Fuck Anthony Taylor, hope you get investigated for that ludicrous display of whatever you want to call that","Mendy can't start anymore. He's a liability. Jorginho can't play in a double pivot, he's always exposed without Kante running for him.. And this front three isn't going to take us anywhere"
48,"I would trust the process if we hadn’t gone so so far backwards. I don’t think it’s acceptable to fall this far back when transitioning.

Clueless.","Kai Havertz with an absolutely stellar performance. 

Also when do we officially gain a reputation as CL merchants?!",[deleted],We're getting relegated with Potter.,How the fuck,Personally I don't remember a match since that arsenal one where potter had a better than 3/10 performance,Criminal officiating. How bad does it need to get for people to see it for the corruption it is? It isn't innocent incompetence these referees have eyes.,"Lots of positives from the performance, Mudryk looks to be a star, Silva is just amazing and Ziyech is finally showing why we bought him.  
Biggest takeaway though is how much of an absolute bargain Badiashile is looking. So composed and good with the ball at his feet for someone so young, never looks shaky, always composed and an excellent passer. What a signing he is.","You know what, Chelsea is better off playing the youngsters at this point. Surely, they can't be worse than Havetz, Jorginho, Mount, Chalobah, KK, and Kepa, right?",These interviews and pressers should be interesting…,"Bunch of questionable things.

Why bring on Gallagher and have him sit so deep to knit play. We know he can’t do that. He’s most effective just outside the box. Put him there.

We got fleeced to fuck by Napoli for KK. Man is spent. Legs gone. Overhitting simple passes left and right. 

Taking off Jorgi. If we were lacking midfield control before we subbed Jorgi off it was completely fucking gone after it. He didn’t play at the WC. He’s fully rested. Just let him sit and push two 8s high either side instead of having a pivot. The Kovacic-Gallagher midfield was fucking atrocious.","We actually had a decent game, but the stupid goal we conceded left a bad taste in my mouth.","I know it was bournemouth, but it's crazy that a good amount of people on this sub have been crying out for 2 wingers (sterling and puli) and mount as a 10 for a long time now.

So fuckin shit man","Not to take away from the performance, but Leao seems quality. Would be a great signing if we ever mange to get him",After visiting Milan's sub I'm baffled by how some of the Milan fans can take the results this badly. It's clearly a game dominated by Chelsea. I actually like Milan quite a lot as a team but some of those fans recently are just...,,"1.50, 1.75, 0.69 (our xG in our last 3 games)


There's a common theme that's been happening in these games under Tuchel and it's so repetitive. 

We have these games where we create almost nothing against a side like Southampton, then a certain player makes *one* defensive mistake and we end up losing. Then our fans go on afterwards about how we need to replace that player and that he's the root cause of all our problems.

Jorginho losing that duel is not the reason we lost this game. Go watch other teams play and see if their DMs have 100% duel success rate, they don't. No other top side is punished so badly for their DM losing a duel.

Newsflash: players lose 50/50s. Rodri, Fabinho, Kimmich, Rice... they all sometimes fail to challenge in those positions. Replacing him will not fix all of our issues and people need to stop pretending that it will. 

The biggest issue with our team is the complete lack of any creativity. Attackers shy away from the ball and on the rare occasion that they do receive it they lose it almost immediately. We won the CL off the back of back to back world class performances by our pivot players - no other team is punished so badly for one of their midfielders having a bad game, because their attackers are able to step up and make up for it.

It is *so hard* for us to score a goal, and has been for a while now. I have no clue how people can watch us week in week out and think that our biggest problem is Jorginho losing a 50/50 every now and then. That wouldn't matter if we had a functinonal attack and that won't happen for a number of reasons. We need technical players who are able to hold the fucking ball and make intelligent decisions with it. No amount of coaching can improve some of these players.",Havertz scoring when Broja is on the pitch really isn’t a surprise…,"Had 4 days off between Milan and this game and somehow, we turned up drunk.

If our performances don't start to improve by a certain date - at what point would you actually say its time for him to go?

I don't want to sack him now, but I think if the actual performances don't improve by the end of the year he has to go. We aren't getting unlucky and dropping points. We are simply playing like garbage.

I’m absolutely sick of crosses to nobody.,"There’s something wrong with TT. Maybe it was his divorce, obviously the whole sanctions thing. I really think this will be his last season if it’s not successful. It seems like there a bunch of players who are indifferent to him. Also he seems quite stubborn and seems to complain the most. Like yeah psg isn’t great and Leonardo seems to be bad but he publicly told them to F themselves which is unprofessional. Then there’s this grabbing contes hand thing. That CL will always be remembered but I think if he doesn’t win the CL or get top 4 this season it’s over for Tommy."
50,How many lads on this sub would still have a job after performing at Potter’s level for so long? Just curious…,"Now feels like a good time to review all the arrogant comments by German pundits before the tie. Dortmund don't even need to worry because we're not a team. Should be comfortable for them. Chelsea are not a top team.

Bye.",Stick to the back 3 Graham Porter,"I’ll say it for the 50th time there is absolutely zero identity in this team. Idk what Potter has been doing aside from collecting a paycheck this entire time. Does he even have a philosophy? Can’t even hold possession and score against a team that has only 1 clean sheet this season. Its pathetic.

I’m not even 100% Potter out but the people who aren’t even asking questions or can’t see this must be delusional. Anybody who downvoted my comment from midweek needs to quit watching this sport because they have clearly no idea what’s going on.",impressed with RLC ngl,"Mason, Kai and Gallagher were poor. The new signings all looked good though, I thought mudryk did too, even though he got taken off. It was promising. We need zakaria/kante back badly. I think madueke, joao felix and mudryk will be lethal once they get going, enzo looks elite already. Potter made questionable decisions though, just had the wrong combinations of players on at the same times, a lot of chopping and changing too. I have hope, there was a lot of positives here.",Potter sealing his fate and I ain't mad at it. Sooner bohley and them boys see he isn't the one the better.,"Frustrating not to win/score but there were some amazing moments in there, Mudryk 😎😎","Challobah can't be a starter, we can't have 3 at the back while Wesley is injured. Hall shows promise on the attacking movement but he sinply isn't ready yet.

On the bright side. Zakaria gets better with every game he plays, Felix looked great before the red and I like how we played with the 3 at the front roaming a lot. Then again both of these bright sides are out of the picture for the weekend...",Our best player for the past 2 games has been a Juventus reject. Shows you the state of the squad.,Plz bring back the worldcup 😔,Hope to see more of Zakaria and Carney from now on,I feel it was a good game from Havertz.

Can’t play so many uncreative players in Jorginho, RLC, and Gallagher",It's time. Bring back Mourinho. One last dance,"This one is on Potter, and Mendy is still not good enough.","Everyone is pissed but honestly the game had draw all over it. I’m honestly not that upset, better than taking a L. We just need to stay in top 4 race until Jan and we will be alright. Lots of supporters in here must have nothing in life besides Chelsea football because yikes some of the hot takes","Stop playing with WBs when Reece is out, RLC is just not it. Havertz playing like he is trying to avoid injury, and hopefully Potter accommodates him busy not playing him.","I have forgotten the last time our forwards linked up through the middle for a goal, it seems like forever since and we seem to be insistent on crossing to a box with no forwards even looking to get on the end of it","Bet we get club brugge lol, we have been pretty lucky in the draw as of late.","Tactical disasterclass from Tuchel today. We still have no attacking patterns and on top of that he keeps experimenting with putting players in different positions, even though we are behind and need to chase the score. 

Ziyech's performance was completely ass but putting him as RWB first (for the sake of Reece moving into RCB) to then switch him to LWB 15 minutes later is completely idiotic.",Really feel good win. Needed that,"Jorginho on his game is one of our most important players, but watching people skip past him with ease for 60 minutes was doing my head in",Good performance all around,Sterling already looks fedup. Scores but the team goes on to concede and he gets subbed off,"A dominant performance reminiscent of our win again Juve last season before it all went to shit. Kind of disappointed that we didn’t attempt to score a 4th but boy that was a welcome clean sheet.  
Also Reece is an absolutely phenomenal finisher!",I see you Kepa I see you 👏 👏 👏,,"![gif](giphy|R9cQo06nQBpRe)

All of us looking at the whole team & manager","Fuck the pundits for complaining about the VAR decision, first of all fucking Antonio should have been sent off. Why is no one talking about that. And fucking VAR denied us three points against spurs.",I know mount scored two.  But kepa is MotM for me,"My fucking heat dawg! The team showed spirit after going a man down. Sterling was really good today but I think Thiago Silva was the MOTM today. Kai showed a lot of fight, Could’ve been better.","Regardless of the hair pull, we can't keep letting in these late goals. We dropped so many points in the final minutes last year too","Soooo if Havertz starts next game over Puli and/or Ziyech, I'd call for TT to be out.

Havertz actively hurt the team today.

Drop Mount to an attacking midfield role, Puli and Ziech on the wings, and Sterling up top/central.

If we could bench everyone (minus one or two players) that started today, I would."
51,This is the worst tactically and mentality wise I have seen this team play. Just utter horseshit. Don’t see this turning around anytime soon….,Let's just win the damn thing for fuck's sake.,Can you imagine this sub if Meslier had scored that at the end lmao,So when does the process start…,"Good teams win games when they play badly, we can't win when we play well!
Potter has to try something other than Havertz up front. Or at the very least tear into him for not playing as an actual striker, why does he constantly wander? Just stay central and look to finish, he's so infuriating. I honestly would rather Koulibaly starts up front than Havertz.",I like Badiashile a lot,"Potter is exactly I feared he wud b after I actually saw his win record at Brighton. Guy loses 8 games in a row at a time with no bones made about it.

Not being remotely peeved about the handball is 🤔","Mudryk looked exciting. Direct, creative, pacy, technical… reminded me of having a Hazard",Tuchel died for this,"The sad thing is we'll get Lukaku back next season. I really hope we sell our front three this summer along Gallagher and Jorginho as they are simply not good enough for Chelsea. We should buy attackers actually have technique, are good in tight spaces and can actually dribble. Let's start with Kvaratskhelia and go from there.","How long before the next ""hot"" why we need potter in charge for next 3 decades appears on the sub 😂😂😂?

I am not in support of sacking him but boy if he continues such form i would be glad to see his back come the end of the season.","Firstly, fuck injuries man, so bullshit. Who knows where we would be with at least somewhat of a fit squad.

Secondly, that was a much better performance. I want to see more Zakaria, more Hall and more of Chuk. Those three in particular were excellent for us imo. Havertz just slightly behind them.

At this rate just get Fofana and Andrey Santos in as well. All these injuries, they'll probably be starting next week.","I have not missed the shitshow that is the premier league refs, Jesus Christ!",Hope all the tuchel out people are really happy with themselves,I hope you’re fucking happy Todd.,Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,Pulisic worst rating in MatchCaster? A bit surprised by that.,Havertz has got to be dropped,Waiting to scratch off ‘glad we’re out of this competition’ bingo card for an excuse to this loss.,"Dark clouds are on the club since last year and it doesn’t seem to go away anytime soon. The thing is while they are not going away we are on constant decrease from our peak under Tuchel achieved in May 2021. We are struggling with continuous injuries, and have yet played with ideal starting 11. 
While we are in turmoil, our rivals Spurs, MU and Arsenal raised from their ashes. We probably won’t make top 4 this season. Our squad is not in the level of City and players are ageing. In upcoming windows, we will still need to spend at least 300m to retain top-notch team in the league race. 

I am afraid if we experience bad decade like MU had since SAF, we won’t be top club again at the end of the decade. We don’t have resources and fanbase to support such low performances in long-term. 

Diplomatically speaking “I’m deeply concerned” about future of the club.",Fuck Ziyech. Don’t wanna see him in a Chelsea shirt ever again,Peak Chaos FC.,"Not the best Chelsea performance but it got the job done. Going forward, Mount and Havertz CANNOT start. They have been too poor for waaay too long. Pulisic or Broja or Gallagher. Kepa had himself a day! Good for him","Such a great feeling of positivity recently with these performances. Onwards and upwards, KTBFFH!","Am I crazy to say that I enjoyed watching how we played today? We tried  to play through the opposition for once and with better understanding between the players, we'd score more. 

Maybe the players are trying to impress the coach, but our football wasn't dire, and it made me look forward to the next match regardless of today's result.","RLC was so dynamic, dominated the midfield today. Very good game for Mason as well. What can we say about Reece, he is such a special player, we are lucky to have him honestly.",Let’s wrap these last couple of games up!!,,When chillwell came on and Puli did a low ‘5’ to signal the defence I thought “this is it”. Nope.,"We made what should have been a clean sheet look like hard work. 

Refs again being utterly shit. 

People reacting like Mendy being kicked in the chest is a perfectly normal thing need to get a grip. 

Fofana looked fantastic. Koulibaly looked meh.

For the line up changes, Pulisic looked fine. I liked seeing something different. Even if it didn't work all that well. 

Broja looked good. 

All in all boring as fuck match but a win is a win.",Few injuries forced us to make changes which didn't look so good first half. Credit to the manager for making necessary changes and a brilliant Kepa performance. Take the 3 and move on.,"Even with all the millions spent, El monstro has been our best signing of the last 5 years. Magical defender",When the world is against you then you fucking convert all chances that you get! We played with ferocity but not converting chances is not going to help us at all!,Can we call up Sam Kerr and Sophie Ingle for this squad? Just hide them in moustaches and unveil them on deadline day
52,"Worse than 2015/16 for me. Not once during that season did I just not want to watch Chelsea. 

I just don’t know if I feel like watching anymore. Call me plastic call me whatever I don’t really care.",Koulibaly at the center of a back three is an absolute beauty. Given his age don't think it's really a problem but I'm not sure Thiago slots into the Badi - KK - Fofana back 3 currently,Seeiing a lot of people on twitter hoping we would loose so that Potter would get sacked. I dont like potter and even after the result I dont believe in him and want him gone but in no circumstances I want to see us loose a game.,"Okay boys, begin the timer -- in 24 hours, this sub will be pro-Potter and cautiously optimistic once again.","We didn’t win but that’s the best we have looked in a long while. Should have been two yellows on Bellingham, havertz should have drawn a PK, great attempts by enzo/felix",Please sell Mount while his value is somewhat decent. Absolutely rubbish this season,Winless away from home since October 16th…,Mudryk looks like a star. Next season with all our players we could actually do extremely well,"Unpopular opinion: Potter did mostly right, it was on the player.","I really doubt potter has the balls or ego it takes to manage the big players and characters in this team. Most of them probably weren’t familiar with him before he was hired. Seems like a situation similar to rangnick at utd. Big players who have won things will only respect a big character, potter seems like kind of a quiet and level headed guy. Who is in there lighting a fire in the belly of these players right now? Getting them to perform?","Very poor....just when you think things are on the up after a win from a long break...you get this hot garbage.  Potter will have to take some responsibility, at least from here on out.  There just hasn't been any improvements since he's came in at all, if anything, looks more of a regression at this point.  

I think at this point, our players are making it obvious they are not buying Potter's vision.  Nobody seems to know how he wants to play at all, and that's concerning this far into the season.  They are trying to get him sacked.","Nothing worse than watching us pass the ball around the back for an age whilst we’re 1-0 down. Also, shoot for once.",Shit ref but a good game,"Arsenal’s only goal was kind of flukey, and yet that was one of the most dominant 1-0 wins I’ve ever seen.","Legitimately not even worth the effort to type out all our thoughts and feelings.

This squad is shite. Like, painfully so. And our actually good players, apart from Thiago, are permanently injured. Kante, chilly, Reece, Kova, cannot stay fit and apart from them our players are not good enough. Mount included. I like him a lot but he has been beyond woeful this season, and it’s not his first extended patch of horrific form","This one is on Potter . wrong line up, playing players out of position.","Some of our players have such a Spurs-level mentality. 

I mean instead of clearing the ball every time we you shouldn't control it? 
I mean you do this all game even getting pressed. why can't you do the last few minutes? 

Or at least if you want to hear the ball clear it on halfway and give away a through. 

Instead, you keep inviting unnecessary pressure. 

Gone are the days when we used to get the lead and rarely conceded a goal let alone on set pieces.",Hopefully we can play like those last 10 min every game for the full 90 from now on.,"It’s fine man, at least I got god of war ragnarok waiting for me at home","I dont rate Sterling at all, City sold their finished trash to us","we need to spend another 270+ mil to be able compete against leeds, Southampton and croatian farmers","We should have won more comfortably but also this game was feeling like another one of those where we somehow draw or lose.

So I'm not in the mood to complain too much.",Pulisic assist 🤫🤫🤫,Shouldn’t go under the radar that we haven’t lost a single game when Trevor starts,That’s a shit result against a very average opposition.,I love how potter is exclusively using Gallagher as a 10. He understands hes more dangerous in the attacking third.,BBQ CHICKEN 🍗,,I swear to God I will never read the match thread again when we are losing. Some people are just brain dead.,Some people will be unhappy that Havertz scored because they can't criticize him today.,So damn nice to see Kepa have the game he had. He was all over the place and looked so confident. Well done. 👏🏽,Someone help. My butthole won't stop clenching,The first Spurs goal is acceptable to a certain extent; Bentancur did get a touch on the ball and Jorgi's trick didn't quite come off but the second goal should never have happened. Romero played dirty the entire game and not even a squeak from Taylor. Wonder what's the point of VAR if it's going to be whimsical decisions all the time.,"Today both the manager and the players got what they totally deserved.  
  
\-We should have been up 2-0 by 15 minuthes yet we missed easy chances.  
  
\-Mnedy wants to be Alisson and this is not the first time he has cost us a very important game with such a silly useless mistake. I see jorgi getting blamed for such mistakes while mendy has been making a lot lately as well.  
  
\-Maybe time for a reality check for him and give Kepa a game or 2. If football is fair Kepa deserves a chance now. ANd I do not like Kepa at all btw.  
  
\-As you can see by my flair Havertz is my fav Player. But I do not want to see his fucking name on the team sheet for the next 10 games at least.  
  
\-Don't want to be harsh on gallagher but he had a nightmare today.  
  
\-Also can we please stop accepting mediocre players and wait for them to reach their potential? Idc if we will look stupid in 4 years time just give me players who are ready to make an impact in the team.  
  
\-Also Havertz is defending with the leeds team in that Ziyech shot please get him the fuck off the pitch.  
  
\-I would love to hear the opinion of all our fan base that said that going for Jesus would be really stupid since he is a City reject and won't make us catch up to them. Liking what you see from both Mount and Havertz today?  
  
As for Tommy:  
  
I'm not a manager so all of these are just reactionary stupid redditor comments but.  
  
\-If you want to swap to a back 4 you can't just not bring Ziyech Asap.  
  
\-Stop wasting James on RCB he is our best attacking asset as a RWB.  
  
\-Stop being stubborn for a certain player ( Auba) while he is stalling and wasting our time or at least first 4-5 games without a striker.  
  
\-Let players who deserve to be dropped be drobbed.  
  
\-Slap Havertz in the changing room to wake him up.  
  
As for our board.  
  
things are really hard and complicated since it was a takeover and we started really late in the market but.  
  
\-Sign a CB so RJ can play in his RWB spot.  
  
\-Sign a mid. Idc if kova and kante are the best players on earth. They are injured for more than half of the season. Does not matter how good they are we need another class midfielder.  
  
\-Sign a striker that puts the ball in the net. Idc about how important it is to press or whatever. Havertz and Werner used to press like a mad man and yet did not matter when they did not put the ball in the net.  
  
We need a striker with great movement inside the box and great finishing ability. Its a shame that RJ and Alonso are our best finishers now  
  
\-Again in my opinion a midfielder now is a very very urgent post to get a player for.  
  
  
These are all my thoughts and opinion on some things. I don't know shit and I'm not a professional coach to argue with anyone over anything this is just my simple brain vision on this."
53,"Must feel nice to score a goal, forgot what it feels like

- Please for the love of god stop playing Havertz as a #9

- Lots of Ziyech haters, he was subbed nothing changed. Cleaely it's not him. It's the entire squad

- No energy, no desire, no 1 on 1. Just passing backwards and to the wings and back. Sterling the only one trying anything

- You are telling me Zidane can't do better? You are a clown if you think Zidane wouldn't make a beast team with this squad.

- Time for Potter out.","Fuck the haters

Chelsea till I die #KTBFFH","I saw fight today from many in the starting 11 and a couple subs. I'll take that, as far as the team is concerned. 

Goals from open play still seem like an impossibility. We're relying so heavily on Felix having a magic moment in front of goal and we're still creating too little despite having all that posession in the final third. 

Today we shoud be thankful Don Fofana ran the game. Stellar defensively, and stellar in the air to head that goal in. That's as close to a 10/10 solo performance from a player I've seen in chelsea for years. Kinda Hazard'esque 

For me potter's job is still hanging by a thread, didn't see enough from a tactical perspective today, it was a lot of reliance on individual ability. Let's see what happens in the Dortmund game next.","Numb that’s the only way I can describe it, outplayed and dominated by 20th place at home fucking disgraceful","Sad, but not mad, honestly. Chelsea played an excellent game, I think all starters were good out there. Unfortunately for us we weren’t lucky, but can still eliminate them at home.","Woeful. Cucu, Gallagher and Mount are average asf","Cucu cannot play the next game, everyone was saying it for this one already and it was even worse with him starting than expected. Same with havertz, put them on the bench. Felix, enzo look top quality but midfield is still looking like a key weakness area with current injuries","Mudryk is the new Hazard. Havertz will do much better with better players, midfield sucks, both Liverpool and Chelsea are utter shit this year.","also what is up with mount man, literally a shadow of his former self. should be nowhere near that starting 11, chukuwuemeka showed more in 10 minutes than mount did in 80","I am one of those supporting Graham Potter, but after this match he leaves without any tools to defend him...","I can already see the Arteta effect being used to defend Potter. 

Arsenal took a massive risk backing Arteta and it’s a big risk that has paid off spectacularly for them. Now no matter how poor results are or if 7th-9th becomes a norm, people will cite Arteta journey at Arsenal for why Potter should remain in a job. Bear in mind Arsenal finished 8th twice in a row under Arteta then 5th. 

Is that what’s going to happen, Potter will be given the opportunity to implement his own “process” and it could take three years with no CL football?  And even still there is no guarantee the process will come together quite like it has with Arteta and Arsenal.

I think giving him the job is a sensational mistake",This is the worst form I’ve seen this team go through all my years of being a supporter.,Ref was interesting...,Chalobah was the lone bright spot,Potter has had plenty of time to instruct his tactics and for the players to get acclimated to the style of football he wants. Extremely concerning that all the players look lost in all phases.,I don’t think Pulisic should play wing back,"Potter needs to start getting the starting 11 right, it’s good to see that he recognizes what’s wrong and makes the changes, but wewaste too much time in the game playing poor","I don’t want to be a hater but with Havertz on we’re playing 10 v 11. Not sharp enough as a (false) 9 and invisible playing behind the striker. I don’t see how he can cement a regular starting spot with Broja improving rapidly and Pulisic finding form.

Need a Reece back-up ASAP in January, one that likes to bomb good crosses in with less hesitation",Potter needs to pull a Klopp and get rid of alot of these players and bring in his own. Majority of them seem not wanting to be here anyways. I hope that’s what Boehly and Co got in mind.,I’m glad we got the 3 crucial points at the expense of our LWB. I think we can all agree the 3 points when we’re already mathematically at the top of the group no matter the outcome is worth risking the health of overplayed players. Couldn’t have asked for a better day and outcome.,Mason Mount is lucky that Ziyech is actively fixing our games in favor of the other team because he was once again awful and would be our worst player if not for Ziyech. Dude has been playing like he took up heavy drinking and drugs in the off season or something,"Good game from the team. Some shaky moments but a lot of positives to kick on from.

Also, I like how you snuck in Griddy into the name of that dude who scored for Salzburg in the match events",A win is a win is a win. But time to rotate the starters. Give other players an opportunity to see if they have better chemistry.,"Biggest takeaway from this match is that every player seemed to know where the other players were. Under our last two managers players have often seemed lost or caught out. That didn't happen today and while the finishing was ugly, the amount of chances and chemistry made the difference. Love the direction we are going.","Our team is mid, no way around it.",What a player Reece James and RLC are,Yes we are back babyyy,,"Broja needs to start, or at least he needs to be subbed in regularly","We absolutely stole a win here, deserved nothing. Have to get good fast. We are about mid table playstyle wise, except we can't counter as effectively.",Puli deserves more of a shot next games than Kai. Absolutely useless apart from a header or two,"Fucking great reaction
Huge game from Thiago Silva, Sterling and Mendy.
Guess some people were disappointed that they can't whine their asses off again.",We need FDJ with injury issues to Kante and Kova. Would love a striker as well.,"Today was just a bunch of shitty individual performances, which further cascaded into a shit team performance. 

Mendy - we all know what the fuck happened

Gallagher - bad bad showing, out of position tho

RLC - I don't get it man, always tries to do an extra silky touch rather than doing the simple things first

Koulibaly - ok but got rinsed by an mls player

*Cucurella - also had a bad showing, but some good moments; i think the system fucked both him and Koulibaly, both were getting overrun on the left

I can't give forward players too much shit, we barely controlled the ball before we went 2 nil down; frantic midfield fucked the whole tempo of game.

Really worried about our mentality now tho, we crumbled faster than a digestive. Also, I feel like tactically we got outplayed, the left side got exposed soo many times.

***I would say zero positives to take from this game, one of the worst games I've seen from this Chelsea side."
54,Enough,"Potter has gone full Mourinho in these last 2 games.

Get the goal. Park the bus. Grind out the win.

Much needed wins of course.","Huge to get three points & a clean sheet. Some positives to take away like Fofana, Badiashile & Chilwell looking a lot sharper. Thought Potter's game management was odd, invited a lot of pressure on but let's hope it's a turning point.","Anyone who said give Potter time I will consider them as a troll or a rival fan

You cannot defend this shit anymore, SACK HIM NOW","We all know what's going to happen. We'll score first in the second leg, then Dortmund will equalise in the last 10 minutes knocking us out. Because we certainly aren't capable of winning a game right now.","And to think, I was excited for that.","On the one hand, Tottenham down by 2 goals at HT is positive news.","Felix and now Mudryk have done more in a handful of minutes than our attackers have done in a season and a half. 

No quality midfielder could make up for players like Gallagher, Mount and Carney tripping over themselves. I am glad we upgraded.","*narrator voice*

The boys did not in fact give everything","Positives: 

1) we weren't expected to win so it wasn't a Villa or Newcastle style shock.

2) erm.......",Please tell me again how Boehly is so much better of an owner than Roman?,Some fucking good performances today!,Despite the ref best efforts we won. Such a bald fraud.,"The biggest problem at the minute (has been for a while) is a lack of depth. We only have 1 attacking RB/RWB (Dave was good today not on him) and 1 attacking LB/LWB in a team that relies on them. Midfield depth is non existant, Jorginho is the only fully fit CM, Kova is still injured, Kante out completely, RLC, Mount and Gallagher are all more attacking mids. Zakaria might be of use coming up but we can't be sure yet. I would have to imagine he starts the next game if only because we need to rotate. We have some rotation options on the wings but all of them seem to do better off the bench. Sterling and Auba are both bang out of form and everyone else is very inconsistent. Broja looks bright when he comes on but again he's better as a sub generally. Even at CB we're very thin at the minute despite signing 3 players who can play CB in the summer. The people complaining about Potter and saying we've regressed under him are idiots. Even when we lost Reece and Chilly last season we had Rudiger at CB still, Jorgi and Kova were fit most of the time. Timo worked very hard and helped the team a lot. The period we're in now has been coming and it's because of poor squad management by the last regime. Fortunately Todd is very happy to overhaul how we recruit, how we build the squad and is seemingly willing to be patient because it's really needed.","I do find it funny how many of our fans only seem to be realising now that despite all our spending our squad is dogshit and has been for ages.

A world class manager squeezed magic out of these guys and then when he couldn’t do it any longer they blamed him instead of seeing what the real issue was.

And they’re doing the same thing again. Questioning Potter rather than realising just how shit our squad is. With time and clever recruitment Potter *might* make us into a good team. There’s no guarantees in football but that’s the plan we’re going with. No manager is going to come in and magically make this group of players perform.","Potter was outfoxed by his former club. The formation and tactics were torn apart by Brighton in the first half; two own goals looks unlucky but Brighton had many more chances to score, 3-0 at half time didn't flatter them. Second half was a bit better but we had too much to do...",Three games in a row of very poor football,"Would love to see pulisic as one of the 10s behind Broja, feel like the link up play between them would be silly it’s a shame they didn’t see the pitch together today","Can't see us improve after the world cup, winter transfer window is very difficult to do business in, Potter is out of his depth, this squad is way too awkward and underperforming to get anything out of.",Chilly has played a lot recently given he’s still getting to full fitness really after the terrible injury. And the most demanding position physically,"Last season I was getting downvoted for insisting that lukaku wasn’t the problem and that even a prime benzema or lewa would suck in this team.

Tuchel is displaying the same issues he had before he was sacked at psg; lots of safe possession and sideway passing, too much dependence on individual brilliance in attack, low scoring wins and soft losses and blaming everything and everyone. 

Fuck me, I really don’t want us in Europa league next season. That shit sucks.","Chalobah is improving rapidly, but my god are we still dependent on Thiago to bail us out!",Every game is a buttclench fest,Even Ziyech was trying today. Attack looking so much better.,"We can keep talking about Tuchel and Potter.
But the issue is the players. It was the samw under Tuchel.
Our recruitment has been dogshit for years.

We simply dont have players that can score goals.

We also lack creativity and goal scoring threat through the middle specially midfield.

Boehly can keep sacking managers but nothing would fix. We badly need a squad refresh.",This was the funeral of TuchelBall. Excited to usher in a new era,"Reece James,................aw shit here we go again",,Bella-Kotchap cost Southampton a tenth of what Gvardiol would cost Chelsea,"We were bloody lucky there. Tactically shambolic. Mendy terrible twice.

Don’t let the win fool you. We didn’t deserve it.",I'm not an RLC hater though he was limited in impact today. Where should we play him? I don't think he fits the midfield well.,This club will be the death of me one day😭,"Tottenham finished the match with 0 yellow cards. I counted Bentacur and Kulu both did 3 fouls each, how does that not accimilate to a yellow card?? fucking clueless",Didn't't watch much of the match but not what I got from this is that you need to be 100% everytime when you play in Premier League especially a team who has been doing as well as Leeds have since start of the season.
55,Today I've learnt that an owner who doesn't spend but doesn't interfere with a top manager is better than an arrogant idiot who spends money but thinks he knows best. Todd Boehly has broken the club,LETS FUCKING GOOOO,"It's nice to win but... let's be honest, we were fucking awful. And after Potter subbed half the team off, we lost all control of the match. 

This win just papers over the cracks. Still not seeing any improvement in our general patterns of play.

Oh well. On we go.","
This is one awful result too far. What on gods green earth do we do in training because it’s certainly not football. I’ve stuck up and stuck up for Potter but being beaten at home by the worst side in the league and everything over the last 15 games has broken me. What has the team shown to make us believe that things will get better under this manager? What is there to make us sit week after week watch these totally shite performances? Nothing and nothing. Getting to the point where I just don’t care anymore. For the first time I’m starting to think of getting rid of him, any manager on the planet would be interested in this job. Will we ever score again?

Hope Azpi is alright on a side note, that really was horrific.",Another game another loss for Potter,BRING BACK THE SPECIAL ONE,"can't believe how well Emerson played today, and we sell him to buy Cucurela. Marc better deal with his shit outside of the pitch and shake it up right now",Nothing better than getting up at 7am for a 0-0. Aubameyang was absolutely useless,How long do we “trust the process” for? Do we just keep losing indefinitely in hope that everything’s magically going to get better?,Hutchinson with a 6.6 rating hahaha. I am sorry but he is nowhere near first team level. He needs to keep developing.,I just want to laugh at all those accounts that were slandering tuchel and were hyping up Potter after couple of games...,"Sucks having that ""it could've been worse"" mentality but I'm just happy we kept Haaland quiet and we didn't get shafted. Tale of two halves again, Zakaria should be bought he's not going to solve our problems but he's definitely helping. Carney was bright, Havertz was decent imo but can't do much with the lack of service. Think the owners will have to drop into the market out of necessity now with all these injuries.",It feels amazing to win,Terrible player selection once again.  Potter is turning out to be just as infuriating as Tuchel became running out Sterling and Havertz week in and week out.  It’s the definition of insanity,"What kills me about today, and recent games, is that Pulisic and Hall look like the only players who give a damn. I know that's not fair, but we have a bunch of people underperforming on the attack, and in midfield, who get regular starts, but week-in, week-out, they look as though they are happy to get their pay checks and go home.

Hall has shown some great effort the last two games, as has Pulisic, and both have been trying to create things for the team. Sadly, almost every time they do our team just kind of stands around...

I said it in the match thread, but in this game we routinely saw Pulisic getting the ball out wide. He would look to pass or make a run, and our entire offense actually just stands there... Puli runs, teams still stands there waiting, allowing New Castle to triple him, and then we lose the ball.

When someone else led the attack it was no different. They'd have the ball, Puli would make a run, but our team JUST STANDS THERE. I get having everyone run in all directions at the same time isn't a great idea usually, but standing still and providing no outlet for ourselves guarantees that we will turn the ball over.

In my mind, the only players on the team right now that should feel ""okay"" with how they've played are Hall, Pulisic, Thiago Silva (because he is absolutely amazing and bails us out 3-4 times a game), and our goalies who have to deal with an absolute cluster and no offense. I'll add Reece James and Chilly to the list since both are out and are usually positive/essential to the team, but nearly everyone else needs to either improve massively, or just get off the field, since it seems like they don't want to be there.

P.S. I know there are plenty of players (if not all) who care, but it just really seems like they are going through the motions right now. It's pretty hard to watch right now, and it's been rough since the last third of last season.","Fired a top tier manager for Bang average one, just because he didn't talk with the obsessive owners.

Had a shit ass window, but we are cooking. Overpaid, took Ls and got humiliated by other clubs. Paid more than Brighton's initial asking price for Cucu lol and gave our CB that could have been better than him here to them.

Got break just when Potter got hired, got an easy schedule to start yet got outplayed by Gerrard's Villa and managerless Wolves, needed Keeper masterclass to get points out of games, Milan was injured with 4/5 starters out, got a unlucky red card in second game. Brentford was all over us. First big game of upcoming very tough schedule and we got humiliated. Dude played 2 winger as wingback as if we are playing team from 3rd division, Brighton go toe to toe with even Liverpool at their best and we were taking them for grated, just like we took Brentford and rotated heavily. A meme ManU ran us ragged. But do not complain about anything or you will be downvoted by the cult, fuck off. Potter has gotten multiple games tactically wrong in such a short time.

These owners have done great moves too like hiring Joe Shields and I praise them fully for them, but they have done more atrocious ones and I'll call them for it too. Tuchel is 10x the manager Potter is rightnow, Potter can become good but firing Tuchel was a dumb move.

I really really hope Potter does well and turn it around, I back Tuchel because I knew his sacking wasn't justified, I back managers to last if they deserve it, I'll be backing Potter if he does well even when other would have moved on, but right now we fucked ourselves by firing Tuchel and sadly the owners may stick to Potter even if it gets to a point that we shouldn't, because they won't want to acknowledge that they fucked up and to show they are in for long haul.",I want Pulisic to start,"Bad lineup from Potter. You can't rotate as much. These are the games we should try to win with main team.

Pulisic was good. Broja should have stayed on the pitch longer.","If we’re being honest although we did create chances this game wasn’t one we were going to win. If we’d scored one or two then Pep would have brought on KDB, Foden, Haaland etc and then it’s a completely different game",[deleted],"Pathetic performance, this team would roll over if you asked them nicely","Man how good was Havertz today. Broja should start a game over Aubameyang, it isn’t working for him atm. Also Kepa with an extremely mixed performance good saves but keeps flapping at the set pieces","Here are my thoughts on the game: I see a team that’s alot more progressive with their passing, and playing with a decent amount of confidence. I think Jorginho, although vital, had a poor game today along with Mount. I actually think Havertz played well, he got into spaces, he dribbled well, and made a few chances for others. Raz had everything but finishing. I think Fofana looked great, but overall and average performance. Looking better already, but we still need to figure some things out. Also what a strike Gallagher!",I know he didn't score or assist but I think Conor Gallagher was our best player today.,"This was a good first game. There were a lot of positives and I’m sick of everyone being negative on this sub. A lot good off ball movement, which led to a good number of chances. Potterball looking optimistic right now. The poor performances today was probably azpi or havertz. I’ll go with azpi as worst performer (ziyech also comes to mind but he didn’t play long enough). Also I was hoping to see the replay of that “kovacic foul”. Anyways, good game a lot of positives, real Chelsea fans ignore those negative comments. Glad to see us aggressive in our play",What we saying Potter doubters?,"""Bet you loved that didn't you Potter?"" - Draco Malfoy",,Feel like shit just want hazard back,"I'd like to see Broja and Havertz partner up top. I think the two playing off each other could be helpful for our attack. It'll allow Havertz to be creative. Otherwise good competition with Chilly and Cucurella. 

Let's embrace the growing pains this year with  the new faces in blue and encourage the familiar ones.","Am I the only person that thinks Mase played JUST OKAY?

His first goal was on a gift. 
His second goal should have been a routine catch... in the middle of the goal. 

AV should have scored 3-4 goals on us and it wouldn't have been close. 

We looked bad until Gallagher came on, imo. And even then, we didn't look GREAT. 

Seeing Kai start in a wing position over Puli is a travesty if Puli is fit at this point. If I'm him, I'm moving on. Even Gallagher is getting more minutes in the wing than him.   And no nonsense about injuries or being in form. He's been great when he has come on.

AV just looked more fluid and always a step ahead. Their movement and passes looked very good. 

Not sure where to look for improvement today - maybe the midfield? Not pressing well enough?

Kepa stole 3pts for us today.","Doesn’t seem like anyones saying it, but is Mount deserving of his starting role at this point? He’s not really bringing anything in recent weeks. Kai’s struggling but at least he’s present and has a high work rate Mase just disappears lately.","They won't, but I'd love for Chelsea to make a big stink over this and request a formal explanation from the Premier League as to why a violent act against one of their players was not penalised.","Sigh.. So, where do we go from here?"
56,"Walking out of the stadium listening to Spurs fans sing ""Chelsea get battered everywhere they go"" and actually agreeing is a sad sign of the times.",Starting 11 is starting to take shape. Loved the fight tonight from everyone. Biggest thing now is to make sure we build on this and keep our levels up,"What were those subs man

Edit: Delighted with a goal win and clean sheet","Can we get a bunch of people to tag Boehly on twitter to resign Tuchel?

It seema to be the only thing he listens to for decisionmaking smdh.","Look at the comments in here, we've turned into Improvement FC.","I am tired of Havertz.


That is all","Everyone is saying things like, we need a proper midfield with enzo, we need a better cf. realistically after the first goal we couldn’t score against west ham B team. There is deeper problems with this team. We should be able to win with the talent on this team by just doing the basics. I liked what we were doing in the first 30, we could’ve been up by 3 if we timed our runs properly. But after that something changed, I’m not sure what but something did.",Mudryk looks unbelieveable.,"sacking Potter will do absolutely nothing. The squad will still be missing 11 players, still be out of form, still be at the table where we are now. Champions league will still be impossible. Why would they sack? As long as we’re not realistically challenging for the champions league not giving him the rest of the season would be senseless.

I am by no means a big Potter fan, i think this game showed more than anything that when a team like fulham can match chelsea in terms of the quality they put on the pitch something is seriously wrong. But let’s be real, this game was a entirely the outcome of 3 HUGE individual errors by felix, trevoh/azpi and kepa. Let’s just pray for a more fit squad for the remainder of the season and let the board assess Potter for the remainder of the season.",I actually numb now as a Chelsea Fan,"There are still people defending Azpi's contract extension, he's a legend yes but he's also the slowest player in the team and gets rinsed by random bozos","The academy boys seem to be enjoying football more than seniors. That really talks about how the mentality of Chelsea looks like.

Also, Cucurella seems to be very average player.",Chelsea are back in the top 4 race,Havertz slipping and falling on his arse sums it up best,Pulisic and Hall were the only ones who were trying to play offense,Potter has got his starting line-up/tactics wrong in nearly every game he's managed under us and has largely gotten away with it until today. Brighton actually capatalised and we were done before he had the chance to fix his own mistakes.,My problem is with GP for the lineup. RLC offers nothing in big games. We need a strong presence in midfield post-kante,"all I want to see next game is Broja, Pulisic and Mount starting. I don’t care who else plays but I want to see that",Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,"Chelsea played ten games since Oct 1st, Chilwell played in 7 of them and went 90-90-89-90-90-26-90 (tonight). I am no expert but a) that's plenty of minutes and b) injuries like that do not (or very rarely) just 'happen'. 

He was also coming from a big injury not far back. Youth were there and would have loved a chance. Even the fans knew playing first teams in this needless game where we didn't have to get anything from is a dumb idea.

Chilly's injury is on Potter and thankfully others didn't get injured. Risked so many for this unnecessary game. 17yr old scored for City in CL today while we were playing like we had everything on line and had 4 spots on the subs bench vacant. We didn't even put youth on the bench when spaces were there. Fucking infuriating.","Martin Keown;

*to the club.","I think from the last 5 years paying 40M for Kovacic was our best deal. 

What a wonderful player he is. 

A wonderful game of football. 
Could have scored 4-5 goals. 

I think this is the best I have seen from Kai apart from his goal he was very much involved in the game. 
Didn't lose too many balls which he usually does. 

Gallagher is enjoying that right side he is starting to play the same way we have seen him in CP last year.","Gallagher dagger feels so fucking good. Also, idk what Mount is on but he needs to watch his temper. Two games this season where he’s almost lost it.","When I saw the lineup I thought we were in for a tough one ngl. Wolves are really bad. Shoutout to Chalobah and Koulibaly, unsung heroes of this match,",I actually liked what I saw... Except ziyech,"Silva single headedly won us the game today. Kept us in it whilst Milan were dominating and then turned the game on it's head and Milan crumbled. Could so easily have just conceded whilst Milan were on top, had Silva not made some great last chance tackles and then had a completely different game. 



His first half performance was about as textbook ""taking the game by the scruff of the neck"" as you could get. A defender stopping any attackers before they could become threatening to our goal and simultaneously being our biggest goal threat","I get AC Milan fans being angry, even if their anger is misguided. But love the fans of other teams getting upset over the correct call. And of course Carragher is aghast by the foul",,I love TT and hope he turns this around. But has anyone actually improved as a player during his tenure?

Someone has to feed Felix and Mudryk.","I don’t blame potter. I blame ownership for sacking tuchel, sacking the back room staff, and ripping out the heart of this club.

The fact that tuchel was sacked in mw4 and potter still has a job (with assurances to the end of the season) says all there is to say about ownership.

Embarrassing lot",I completely trust the process we should sell most of our squad and start from scratch.,Sooooo....what exactly does potter do better than Tuchel?,"Definitely positives to draw from the performance, we looked way better than I expected and we were threating at times, even before city took the foot off the gas. Our press worked really well which was very surprising, sadly we couldn't contain their energy in the beginning of the second period, I think most were feeling that a goal was coming. I'd say our midfielders were our best players today, especially Zakaria and Carney, I think they did their jobs very well. Havertz has looked good imo in the last 3 games. Silva and Kovacic solid as usual. Looking forward to what we can do in the cup, it's essential to not crumble mentally after the loss.",11 shots inside the box is a huge. We would go games with only a handful of touches inside the box before.,This team is a disgrace,"It is what it is, team desperately needs a break.

He’s slow on the turn. He doesn’t create anything and doesn’t really win many balls either.,Felt like the kind of game that we may have drawn under Tuchel. Nothing was really going our way but we pulled through. I had hoped Broja would have come on earlier but maybe we’ll see him against Brentford.,A win is a win.

Under lampard, 0 top flight managerial experience, transfer ban and hazard sale, still came top 4 and even reached a cup final first season. With potter - out of every cup in the first elimination round, languishing mid table. 2 wins in 14 and ppl think it’s acceptable? There are so many coaches out there who are clearly better than potter. Why should Chelsea settle for this mediocre coach especially with the insane investment into the squad?

Boehly, you fucking moron, fire this man, and get in someone who actually knows how to coach a top club, not someone who's just happy not to lose. You have more than enough analysts and advisers to know that he's garbage.

Really need to start being more clinical in front of goal.,"Havertz, Mount, Kovacic, Trev, Azpi, Koulibaly and Kepa were fucking disgraceful today, all of them could leave in this window and I wouldn't give a shit.

Potter will field the same shit front 3 in the next game.,getting outclassed by a team in relegation battle 👍,Zakaria best player. Honestly I’m not mad about this loss. Drawing against Forest is worse than losing to City.,That may have been the worst performance I have ever seen from a referee. Good win to build off of. Mase was everywhere today. Boys came out with something to prove but could have been a lot better second half.,"Our midfield is so bad against teams with any sort of pace and physicality. RLC and J5 doesn’t work in a two or three.  

Sterling starting over Pulisic at any point now makes zero sense. At least he brings some flair we need desperately. 

Potter has been underwhelming in his lineups.",I’m convinced potter is fully out of his depth and that starting front 3 today is what solidified that. On paper we have the quality but there is a massive disconnect on the pitch and I really hope potter can get his act together and figure things out. The high standards that were set by the previous owner seem to be getting watered down by the day,Werner >>>>>>. Sterling,Hate how we concede all these late goals at Bridge for over 2+ years now,Pulisic proved he deserves a start Saturday,"That was incredibly dissapointing but also quite promising. It was dissapointing as we gifted 2 goals and really, should have scored at least 2-3 ourselves. But it was promising because that's one of the best performances I've seen under Potter.

A real standout today was Cucurella. Seems he has gotten over his problem from earlier last month. Had an excellent game. Alongside him Hall was superb as well. A bit of a shame to see him go off early, but he did look gassed.

Koulibaly had both a great and a terrible game. The guy is world class with his feet. Rivals Silva imo with how good his passing is. But 10 mad minutes leaves us 2 down. One where he doesn't jump in the wall, and the other where he just let's Alvarez run off him.

I want to see more Gallagher. His energy is excellent but I also thought he gave us a lot of forward impetus when he came on. 

I can't say I'm happy to lose, because I'm not, but we lost to City and we gave a real fight, not like the terrible showing against Arsenal.",Just imagine Tuchel almost got us thrown out of the champions league thank God for Potter,"This game was shit on so many levels.

Also I wonder what kind of attacking drills they do in training. Every game they attack with no cohesion at all. They will take forever to find someone for a simple pass.

We somehow defended better with 2 CBs instead of 3.

The very worst thing is the complacency. They play like they don't care. And Tuchel does not call them out.

Say what you want about Lampard, at least he pushed players to perform and called out their weak mentality.","Kai was good, could have had 2 assists as well. Auba & Sterling bad again. Chalo keeps improving. Gallagher was great and Thiago is Thiago.",Also want to give a shout out to auba for his goal as well. Really good turn and shot off the pass from Silva.,Also who in their right mind thinks Haaland is better than Broja? I think Broja is clear,"We have so many overrated and expensive players, fk.","Great performance.

Potter tactics work perfectly.
We caged Milan into their half.

We did not press their GK and CB but whenever their midfielder or FB got the ball we pressed them to force mistakes.
Milan did not have any answers to Potter's tactics.

Normally, I criticize RLC for his work rate but today he did his part well just hope he doesn't drop in nexmatchch.

Kepa looks like Mendy won't be getting a starting possession back. Kepa was calm and good in possession.

Quite the turnaround.,At some point I would like to see KK and Fofana as back 2 pair. We need to rebuild without Silva as the main man,Did we use 22 different players the last two games? (Counting subs obviously) Potter building up everyone’s confidence. There were a handful of times wolves just ran straight down the middle of the field past everyone which was concerning but dominant performance for the most part. Hope the rested lads are ready for Tuesday now.,"Sterling's chance was a gift from the opposition (though expertly taken and full credit to Raheem). The other three best chances were Broja to Ziyech, Pulisic to Ziyech, and Havertz off a corner. Mount's chance was a lucky deflection.

The point I am trying to make is the starting combo of Havertz/Mount/Sterling are dreadful at creating meaningful chances and have been all year. It's insanity to keep running that trio out there.","Well that was embarrassing. 

All I’ve heard all week is how worried fans are about Milan, how they’re going to rip us to shreds - Palace were a million times better. 

Play a nice solid game next week and we’ll breeze past this lot.

Well played lads!",Take that 538,,"Zero changes up front.  Same front 3 again and they looked woeful. 

Broja was decent when he came on. 

Silva again is just a great player.  

Tuchel has got to make some sort of changes with the lineup.","Key takeways:

RLC was rough. Killed a number of attacks, but passion is there.

Sterling seems invisible even though he clearly wasn’t.

Pulisic played mostly well, was our most threatening player till his sub, and 100% passing on 24 passes. Still needs to react quicker on finishing. 

Broja with a ton of energy and was threatening, subpar passing tho, I think 57%. Needs a start imo, I think he deserves the chance.

Kai in the right places, well earned goal

We would not survive without Silva. 2nd for MOTM.

J5 should be gone.

Chilly should start, earned it today. MOTM.

I’d seriously try Kepa for a game. Maybe it’ll wake Mendy up.","Football is funny. We’ve played better, defended better than that a number of times and conceded, and even lost. We did not play well, had to play a number of players out of position. Away to Milan in the week. Injuries, fatigue. I’d take that all day long.","Honestly one of my favourite performances from this team. Reece, Thiago, RLC, Chalobah, Cucurella, Jorgi, Sterling all with 10/10s given the circumstances. Elite shithousing from Kai was the cherry on top.",Such a bent league. Blatant foul on havertz nothing given. Blatant hair pull from Romero who has been fouling all game no red.

How do you not play your best 11 when we're on a losing streak...

Unlucky is one thing but being out-hustled and tactically dismantled by 20th place, demotion bound Southampton is beyond me.

The lads haven't played together enough? Fine.

But, when you spend that much money to conjure results, something has to suffice right?

The mentality of the group is what worries me and that comes from the TOP of the leadership group.","Despite the result, this was such a refreshing game to watch. So many positives from today. Especially Ziyech. A surprisingly good shift from him.",I just don't know. This just sucks. Maybe one day we will score a goal,"I think people are overreacting about this result. We were good in the first half. We had 3 balls in the net, 2 of them were disallowed. We looked fluid in attack and only conceded because Cucurella lost his brain in defence and Reece lost his man at the far post. We were also a really shit decision away from a penalty and a chance to win the game at the 89th minute. We get that penalty and people would be talking abot how great we were and how Potter is starting to set the peices in the puzzle but one terrible decision instead and now people talk about how bad we were.

We saw improvements against West Ham, this team is moving in the right direction. I like that Potter doesn't lose his cool in the presser after the game over the terrible decision. The moment he loses his head, is the moment he loses the project and his job. We finally have an emotionally intelligent manager. The era of the Mourinhos is over, Conte is struggling at Spurs. We have a great project going on at the club and you need emotionally stable and level minded people leading the project. Just like how you can't have emotionally unstable people leading a business if they act out based on their feelings.

I understand the fans want the manager to be a mirror of how they feel themselves after being robbed of a blatant penalty in the dying minutes of the game but we can't have an emotional manager trying to lead a project at the club. We will never be a consistent club if we sack Potter and give up on the project now.",I'm truly excited to see João and Mudryk play together when that time comes,[deleted],Watching Chelsea at the moment is downright insulting,I am very skeptical of Potter’s ability to turn this around. It baffles me some of the people on this sub want to give him 3 years. This squad is no where near as bad as these performances suggest.,"If we build upon this match I'll be a happy man... The team looked way better than last week, but if we regress again I'll be worried..","Great win today! Keep playing like this and pray for Reece, we should be good to go against Forest.","Today's performance was so disappointing and disheartening as a fan since we didn't compete. It has been a turbulent year in general. 


We have to look forward and not let our heads down. We would have to accept that this year is and maybe even next might go away in transition. We need to get our transfer policy right and I hope Potter can really come through. Kudos to Azpi and Jorginho for giving their all and showing great commitment.",[removed],"Spurs came back. Lol. 

We're shit.","Could’ve atleast played full strength against Brentford and got 3 points out of two games instead of 2 :/
Just don’t like this resting the team for next game in PL mentality. It’s understandable for cup finals etc.",Potter gambled resting players and playing an A- team and it didn’t pay off. We needed an early goal against them to stop them from parking the bus.,Finishing that match with 0 goals is absolutely embarrassing.,Deffo getting psg in the next round,"I've been turning off the game at half time because watching Chelsea play right now is painful. Repetitive repetitive repetitive.. Tuchel, thanks for the champions league, but we need just something different.",We can rest our 6-7 main players for the next UCL match which happens to be before the arsenal match,Also I don’t want to hear any more of this Trent Vs James bullshit anymore. James soooo clear.,"Yes Wolves are in a bit of a nightmare right now but in the past we've failed to take advantage of this.

Good to see a comfortable 3-0, could have been more but with most of our key players rested, this is by far the best result possible.",It’s as if our issues weren’t due to Tuchel. Team can’t finish for shit,Man and there were so many absolute fools bitching about the line up.,Can we just talk about how Chelsea have never lost a game that Chalobah has started,,"Most mercurial team out of the top clubs in England. Insane how we can waffle between incredible and absolutely gash week in to week out, season to season. Hopefully with new owners that systemic problem will eventually become corrected. Too many of you have grown accustomed to shipping off the manager as soon as players start downing tools. Hopefully we do the reverse.","Despite the fact that we won, we were really really poor. On and off the ball. 

Constantly passing side to side, and forcing play to the side, trying to put crosses in when we don't even have a striker. What even was the plan there? 

We were better in the 2nd half only after Broja came on (by which I mean a proper striker came on). And after Mount was linking up the play.",‘‘Twas ugly. Didn’t look confident. Sloppy midfield and CB play. Still a win on the road with a clean sheet. COYB,"Considering it was 10 vs 11 for like 70 minutes of the match this was a great showing. Could have honestly been 4 goals for us considering James and Sterling both had shots come
Off the woodwork. We came under a lot of pressure but the team got 2 goals and saw out the win and it’s all you could ask for when being a man down for so long. Definitely showed a lot of character especially after last weekend.","yeah the refereeing was a fucking disgrace but Sterling and Havertz missing two sitters cost us, it’s the same as last season, easy wins pissed away by pathetic finishing","Seems the whole team, including Tuchel, is not in the right mind today. We were not prepared for Leeds’ pressing from the very start. I wonder  what the problem is at this point."
61,What is potter trying to do? What's the gameplan? How are we supposed to play? I don't see any patterns.,Fuck yeah boys. KTBFFH,"I really want to beat the Gooners next month. Pothead or not, we need to beat these cunts in their own backyard.",Potter fucking fraud!!!!,"Not remotely worried - absolutely battered them, just couldn’t get a goal. We’ll get them at the Bridge.","Before the game I saw that were only 2 points off Fulham and thought with a win, we would overtake them in the table. After watching the game, I realized, why are two points off in the first place. Miles to go.","Just absolutely dire, Potter offers nothing and we need to get rid of him. We have so much class in the team but somehow Potter manages to bring the worst out of them","Very bright start from Mudryk. Game was there to be won, kinda disappointed with the draw. Mount needs to be dropped, how can he continue to get a start in this team playing like that.",We lost on a deflected shot and a misplayed cross from Kepa. Felix looked awesome until the challenge. I’m not sure what Potter is supposed to do about these.,"This feels like Nuno at Spurs.

I think it'll get worse before it gets better works a bit but honestly there's someone out there that can produce better results.

Board either need to stick or twist right now.",reminder that we declined 40m for Gallagher and that for some reason he plays ahead of Carns and Hall.,"At this point, our injured X is probably better than most premier league teams on paper

Mendy, James, Fofana, Chilwell, Kanté, Loftus-cheek, Mount, Sterling, Pulisic, and Brotha ffs",Mase is a great interviewee.,"Pathetic. Looked lost when we had the ball, no fight or desire when we went behind. Future looks bleak.","""We tried our best against a top side""",We're not making top 4,No idea how Sterling gets a 6.3 for this match. He should be at most a 3.,"We were traaaash 

Fuck brendtford

See you all on Saturday",What was it Tuchel said? Same team same result. Will be good to get rid of the players who want to leave (you can almost smell it over the club) and start from scratch.,"Gutting for Chilly. We're just so unlucky with injuries this season.

All the criticism I've seen for Zakaria so far seems to be due to lack of match sharpness so very positive debut from him. Mount is a Kanté-mini who just never stops running. Jorgi had a great match and Mendy deserved more love for that save earlier in the second. Also Broja on the wing won't get the best out of him or for the team.

Next up Arsenal. Let's go!","My concern right now is just watching Mason's body language. Mason is the guy who is always ready and eager. He's looking deflated on the pitch. The squad feels pressure and is struggling to deal with it. 

We have serious issues with lack of aggressive movement in and out of spaces. We REALLY don't want to give the ball away cheaply on the half way line. We need the lcb and the rcb to carry the ball, too. Would like to see Zakaria and Kova with slightly more freedom. I also reckon Connor is the type of player now to give a run of games.",Not enough respect here for Kovas goal one touch worldie,Potter is building something…,Probably won't be mentioned much here but that's another great performance from Chalobah.,Can't even get a managers bounce with these players.,"With Kante set to be back too, the only thing that can stop our momentum is ourselves. KTBFFH",[removed],,"There is clearly some tension in this squad. A LOT of players who probably don't want to be here who are still here. Tuchels is in the middle of rebuilding the squad and it's still a massive job. Jorginho, Kante, Silva, Azpi all need to be replaced with starting quality players. Tuchel has a massive job on his hands to get us into the top four this year.",How bad is Kepa for not getting even a sniff to start a game over Mendy?,"Not the best game, team wise, but it is nice to see a coach who makes the smart subs and does it promptly.",... And unclench,"Fuck Anthony Taylor

Fuck Conte",[removed]
62,"Everytime someone made their debut ( 2/3 days after joining the club), they were so good. But is it even possible for all players to regress so soon.","Undefeated in March, let's fucking goooo!!!","Idk what happened but i watched us draw and lose the last games. I think the last chelsea game i saw us win live was against milan. Didnt watch this live and ofc we won.

Youre welcome btw","To see a club battling for relegation handedly beat us is shocking. Couple that with it being a HOME game AND the fact that Southampton have NOT held a clean sheet since the middle of OCTOBER, AND the fact that we have scored 5 goals in our last 10+ games, this is legitimately shocking and disgusting","I'm in the acceptance phase. I'm no longer sad or angry, just meh.","Decent match, loved seeing the new faces performing well. Onward and upward","1 win in last 8 games, Potter is so out of his depth to manage a big club that’s all about winning",Waiting for that Murdyk + Felix combo,"The same players, same problems. These are the same guys that gave up on super Thomas. And I'm not talking about fringe players that get limited sub minutes. I'm talking about core, week in week out players. At this point I'd rather we spend all the clubs money on a cloning machine to create more Thiago's because hes the only one worth a dam.

Nothing too much to say about potter. I know we are in for a ""rebuild"" and the injuries are tragic but I'd like to see a guy who can problem solve with what hes got. 

Last point because this drives me crazy, how many days has it been since we all unanimously discovered azpi isnt a proper rwb replacement? Well over a year now and still no action","Havertz, Mount and Gallagher are horrendous","Tuchel died for this.

Positives - Kepa, Silva, Ziyech 

Mega negatives - koulabaly, Sterling , cucurella, aubmamyang (that miss was disgusting),","Our midfield looked solid today and most of City’s dangerous attacks came from the wide positions. I think Kova and Zakaria have developed a nice pairing and we should keep that going if they can. Also start Lewis Hall at LB, and start Carney at one of the winger spots if Sterling or Pulisic isn’t available on Sunday.",You lot looked very good today. Bit of a nervy last 10 but nice movement and passage of plays. Silva will be hard to replace. My main concern for Chelsea is I believe James is the glue that makes your team a top four team. He is your most important player (rare for a fullback to have that impact on a team) and you need him to compete this season. I hope the injury is not serious,"Players were bad, sans Silva as is tradition.

I blame mostly Potter for selection (Kova for Ruben, Pulisic for Sterling), and the abysmal tactics if there even was some plan.

Dreadful... Arsenal miles ahead and it shows.","Vs Man UTD Dominated .... 


Vs Brentford wet cardboard performance 


Vs Arsenal. Dominated


Vs Brighton. Dominated


Vs Newcastle Dominated 


At least under T.T we were depressed because we couldn't figure out what to do in the final third, and always fell for smash and grabs this, this is unsustainable, we risk getting into an apathy pit of lack of ambition that takes years to get out of, examples Arsenal, Man UTD.","Controversially sacking a fan favourite manager not only ruins the atmosphere around the club, it also puts the next manager in a precarious situation where even the most level headed supporters will call for blood after a bad result. This was a terrible, terrible result and Potter should be ashamed. Brighton were powered by sheer spite and it was clearly too much for our players.

Let's not even talk about the players tho, at this point we're well aware of the fragile mentality of this squad and how they react to conceding an early dodgy goal. Just compare that with Tottenham today. Two goals down and they come back to win it. This is Tottenham Hotspur, by the way, the club famous for its ability of bottling under pressure.

So, weekend ruined, out of the top 4, with Arsenal, City and Newcastle next. Is it too early to put Potter on the Fraud Watch? You tell me.",Just please for fucking gods fucking sake sign 3 fucking midfielders who don't have an injury record. My god are we stupid?,Potter gives a 2x ability boost to all Spanish players,"Honestly that was a much, much better performance than on the weekend. We were very competitive, yes the game had less riding on it so maybe City didn't have the motivation that Arsenal did but when you go to the Emptyhad and their goalie gets the MoM you know that you did alright.

Moving forward it means we play less games which is a big plus and we know Lewis Hall can easily come into the team when needed. Ziyech was sharp aswell. Unfortunate for Omari not to come on but I understand why as we were chasing the game.

Don't be so negative guys. This game was undoubtedly clear progression from the last game and if we can replicate it against Newcastle we might have a chance of getting a win.",InjuryFC,"We can’t defend, we can’t score and we play horrible football. 

Terrible trifecta.","Only complaint I have is why is Jorgi taking that shot in the 93rd minute instead of cycling the ball back to Kepa? Have to manage games better but it didn’t come back to bite today. 

Totally different team when we have Puli and Sterling occupying the wide areas of the pitch. Keep Kai central. What a goal today.",Gallagherrrrrrr,What if potter is actually harry potter and pep was voldemort..?,Idk who the third attacker will be but Broja gotta start with Sterling,Two actual athletes in midfield made all the difference.,Jorginho is high quality,,8 points behind Arsenal if they win tomorrow I don’t see us making up that difference,Terrible performance but I’ll take it. Chilwell is straight baller. Mendy needs to be benched and get his mojo back.,"We’re lucky that Potter managed to cast Imperio onto Mings.

Boehly looked properly worried and stressed in the stands.,Man…Potter has had enough time. I’m with the Potter out club at this point.,"For as much hype that is around this Dortmund team we were the much better team, just unlucky today. We have to become more clinical on another day we beat this team 4-1. On  a bright note Koulibaly looks much more at home in a champions league match than he does in the prem lol having chilwell back in the lineup helps too.","Fofana looks good, so does madueke, Enzo was a baller, Havertz needs some time on the bench as does mount, idk why the team didn’t try to involve Mudryk more.

Overall some promising things in this game.",I can already smell the draw coming up against Southampton,"New signings look good.

 Why do our players still slip so fucking much. 

Silva found the fountain of youth. 

Mudyrk gave my balls a tickle I haven't felt in a while.

 Auba is a useless sub, bring on fofana instead. Seasons over so why play a player who will be gone when you just signed a youngster?",We really really really underestimate how much money Roman spent on firing managers and how little he gave a fuck about firing managers….. that’s why we are in this situation right now. The players got used to that situation and the new owners aren’t going to keep doing what he did in the past because they don’t have Russian Oligarch money. I will be less shocked if Potter resigns than if he is sacked,"This is a good cutting of the wound. Hopefully people will realise what the club needs and where the problem lies.

Jorginho is inadequate. The preaching of these delirious views need to stop. Jovacic (Jorginho + Kovacic) is terrible - they do not work well together. Jorginho in a midfield 3? Can we finally realise he can’t function. He needs 3 CBs covering for him. “He doesn’t require physical attributes, he’s that good on the ball”, please refrain from talking if you believe this, he’s poor technically on the ball (bad passing technique + vision), hides a lot too so we’re forced to play down the wings - Thiago Silva is our ‘regista’ we play out through him. The entire team has to cripple itself to cover for his weakness. Kante was Jorginho’s saviour - made him look like a serviceable athlete.

Havertz is a terrible striker. His first touch doesn’t stick, he neither offers threatening movement or a creative outlet. He does not have vision or play making ability. At best he’s a poacher who can get to the end of a cross. We kept the wrong German, Werner offered so much more - he had a better understanding of the game, he would drag players out of position, and on the ball he would always try play threatening. He could create a goal. Albeit Werner was technically weak, he was must stronger as an overall player.   


Downvote me as much as you want, I'll keep preaching the truth. I said we'd get slaughtered in the prematch thread and we did. I had tickets to go to the game and chose not attend. Why? I am not travelling from London to Manchester to see Havertz upfront - not worth my time or mental health.",Forest are such a poor excuse for a football club. The way they hacked our players all match was unbelievable,We played well. Onto the next.,We should get Reece James's backup or else he'll be the new Kante,"Tuchel was right, Same Players. Same issues.

We have no creativity

Cucurella wasn’t that good

Havertz disappointed

Late subs

There are so many errors

But most important: we have injuries, so we shouldn’t forget about that","That was some of the worst time wasting I’ve ever seen in my life. Dirty, scummy, shameless, fucking hell. Could’ve performed the entirety of Hamlet during each stoppage. Sure I’m biased and salty but it doesn’t take a Chelsea fan to acknowledge how fucking pathetic that was from Newcastle.",Fucking play Azpi RB in a 4atb and stop with this fucking shit Pulisic&Sterling at wb ffs…,The commentator on NBC ended with “the great teams find a way” like this United team hasn’t been shit for almost a decade and will likely come 3-6 this year,Wasted opportunities galore,"Not too bothered honestly.

They look so good with their organised press and traps that Potter has set up and creatively Mount has stepped up levels already. Back 4 or back 3 I trust us to score 2+ goals with how we play, props to Kepa too because he looks so confident and dominant even after not playing for a long while. Thank god Boehly got us Potter, his man management skills are too good",Broja is a machine.,Rainy day for the Tomori parade.,"I'm geniunly asking guys I don't want to soound like a mood killer caus I really enjoyed our game  
  
but did you guys feel that conor is a bit slower than everybody else around him?  
  
not talking in terms of pace or work rate but idk it seemed like when mount was there and even other players are a lot more fluid and two steps ahead when they get the ball  
  
a lot of times he got the ball and slowed the attack down a lot idk.  
  
Again he is an amazing player annd I can't wait for him to become the beast I know he will be but I'm just asking if you felt the same.  
  
Maybe he is stressed out a lot?",,"Tuchel should've stuck with the back 4. I don't know why he thought switching to a 5 would help create more chances. It just isolated the players on the wings even more and caused confusion between the wingbacks and the forwards because they had to switch their positioning mid-game. I'm really not that worried about the defense. Azpi and KK played poorly but that's not on Tuchel and I expect them to play better as they get more match fit. (Hopefully Azpi won't have to play much anyway). The attack was awful and Tuchel should take heat for that, but it will take time if he's trying to switch to 4atb and Pulisic, Mount, and Havertz were all pretty bad at dribbling. RLC also gave the ball away cheaply when he had passing options.

&#x200B;

Tuchel has to pick something and go for it. This chopping and changing means he's panicking and is usually a bad sign for the future. The players will be able to tell during training when there isn't consistency in decisions. He's said that the team don't know what they want to be, but he has to make the choice. It's not about having the perfect scheme, it's about getting players to buy in and perform to their potential. I think 4atb is better, even if they personnel isn't ideal and I hope he isn't scared to continue to select for it. You want more difficult decisions Thomas, well this is the big one.","Chilly is better than Cucu, but people taking it granted that just because Cucu was 60m, Chilly is getting beched. Lol, our most dangerous player before injury, along with Reece. Chilly is class. And people just wrote him off (not all, but many). 


That's why I jave been saying despite bei.g a good player, signing Cucu will prove to be wrong. Two good players won't want to be backup. One will push away and we won't get the money back.

But It was a shocker of a performance some of the players just wants a fat contract and to enjoy from the sidelines. 

And those who wants Hall to start over Cucurella should look at his performance he is not ready stop being like Arsenal fans and hype youngsters.
Cucurella made 42 chances last season for Brighton.

He is struggling because all our players are playing very poorly.

Marina made a big blunder by letting go of Rudiger and Christensen without getting anything in return and on top of that did not sign any Midfielder for 4 seasons and more on that went from Pedro, Willian, and Hazard to Pulisic and Ziyech. 

Pulisic still comes good but is far too inconsistent and injury prone. 


Down comes Tuchel who gets full keys in the summer. 
And instead of going for a Midfield and Wings. 

He brought 3 defenders and 1 finished striker. 

And Boehly made the blunder to sack him after spending 275M. 

The problem is our senior players are too senior and the ones who are good are always injured. 

We need to move on from Havertz, Jorginho, Gallagher, pulisic, Ziyech, RLC, Auba, and Azpi we should cut our losses on them and move. 
And if Mount doesn't agree with below 200K let him go too. Although I do think he suits Liverpool a lot better.

Was one of the very few cheering in the section we were sitting in 😂 Chilly Reece and Silva played amazing,,"Following from my rant from the last game... Here's another!

Tuchel with the great idea of rewarding Havertz/Jorginho/Mendy who have been terrible all season with another start is really astonishing. I guess we're seeing them for the next 33 games, can't say I'm looking forward.Jorginho can't play without a back 3. He has no legs. He failed to 'dictate' and 'control the tempo', Southampton ran over him. Looked like a dead fox on the M25. His passing ability is piss poor, has really no vision or creativity and has made a career out of passing from one wingback to another. Anyone partnered up with him gets injured as they have to run all the extra distance that he doesn't cover, so now RLC has gone down. Was really looking forward to seeing him this season but he's chilling with Kante now. We should've sold him this window and I'm praying he doesn't renew and just goes for free next summer. Want to see the back of him.

Havertz is the most overhyped player I've seen in a Chelsea shirt. He's a German Peter Crouch, only really good for heading. He has no vision/finesse/passing ability, how is he a 'flair' player. We kept the wrong German, missing you already Timo, you actually offered something in the game other than your abysmal finishing record.

Mendy got blasted at near post from outside his box, got a hand to it as well. Maybe should've done better? Well... When Kepa got packed in by Tielemans in the FA Cup final everyone was against him, I guess the same standards should apply to Mendy, so many mistakes now. Tuchel should really be giving a chance to Kepa, at this point I assume Mendy has nude photos of the manager.

Sidenote, Ziyech wasn't good, and Pulisic was awful with his dribbling but they don't play every game nonstop...","Mendy is not good, honestly needs to be dropped","Good result from a tricky away game following mid week game in Italy.

That first half was atrocious, absolutely atrocious. Our poor finishing in earlier games cost us, but today we didn't even generate any chances of our own. Our tactical system is awful, back and forth in the backline and then down the sides to wingers with their back against the goal and a defender up their ass. This is the only pattern of play I've seen in our games and it sucks ass.

Finishing has also been very poor and we constantly underperform our xG, but I feel that's because we generate awkward chances that the players are unfamiliar with. They all come from random ass moments of brilliance or a weird situation and they're definitely not rehearsed.

I won't stand on the barricades calling for Potters head. This season is a dud anyway, it's not my decision either way and it's not worth my energy.

It was not Tuchel and its clear as day. They give up, dont chase after they loose a ball, dysfunctional team, aimless passes, no desire to win. I don't know what is needed every single player looks really bad .","We have to be cursed all these injuries are not normal, I mean we had both keepers get injured too this season like what are the odds that happens?","While we were not impressive this game, hats off to Zagreb and their tremendous performance. Nonstop effort all game, strong in every challenge, and Orsic was clinical when called upon.

From our side, I chalk this loss to individual mistakes, hesitations, and our very real lack of goal threat from distance.

I thought Tuchel set the team up well to dominate possession and move the ball in the half spaces. Lots of misplace passes, especially from Mount Ziyech, and individuals taking too large of touch, especially from Havertz. Passes were not quick enough, and too often aimed at the wrong foot, slowing down play and forcing runs to be mistimed. This made our attack disjointed, especially when the linkup play was begging for some fluidity of combination passes. This is maybe expected when trying to build a cohesive unit with so many new signings, though no way to be certain. We created many opportunities to send in crosses, but hesitated on the execution, especially from our trailing defenders with layoffs from wide.

From a structural perspective, Kova and Jorgi are given acres of space 20-25 meters from the goal every game, and show no intention to rip a shot off. Defenses aren't panicked about this dynamic and can hold their ground with markers in others areas to keep the spaces tight. This is the area the opposition were prepared to concede, and we had no obvious answer to take advantage.

James was our main standout, with decent performances from the rest of the defense. This loss was not on them, though their positioning on the goal was cocky. Guess it's time to be sad and watch City put on a clinic. KTBFFH",There is just something about Chelsea in the cup competitions,“Not good enough” Pulisic gets 10 minutes and an assist while Havertz and Mount get 80 minutes and can’t get a shot on target,Back to back 3-0 wins.

Some positives taken, hopefully over turn it in the 2nd leg","Hard to feel anything other than anger watching that.

I'm going to first focus on some positives:

Badiashille continues to impress: 3 games 3 clean sheets.

Enzo looked good. Not 120 million good, but absolutely the sort of presence we need in midfield.

Madueke had some good moments. Not as good a cameo as I thought Mudryk had last week but good.

D.D. Fofana will get stick for his miss, it was real bad, but he did very way to stay composed and beat the GK and defender.

Now for some rants.

Mount has to be benched. I love him and what he's done for us till now but that was a truly fucking awful performance. Outperformed by even Gallagher, who himself had a not great match.

Mudryk was not good. I'll cut him some slack because of match fitness and he'll need time to integrate into the squad, but I really do hope we see less of that.

Havertz should never play as a striker again. We desperately need one. Get Vlahovic, get Osimhen, hell get Mitrovic or Ivan Toney for all I care just someone who isn't Havertz or U21 to start as striker. We're going to deeply regret dropping Auba from the CL squad (and likely pissing him off from any good PL performances)",Almost every team above us drew or lost today. What a chance missed to gain some massive ground,Excited to see Ziyech playing well again,My major concern is that I don’t see any catalysts to change how things are going,"Fofana needs to lead the line for us for the foreseeable future unless we plan on bringing in a proper forward this transfer market.

Havertz, Mount and Sterling played out their skin for the first 45, and Zakaria is an absolute must start from here on out.

Also people need to start calling out mount the guy acts like a big player outside of the pitch but shows up 2 in every 10 games it's a huge problem,Pulisic being the only one trying to take on defenders with dribbling and he's knocked for it in the player ratings compared to almost everyone else who makes safe passes.,Potter still hasn't figured out tactics/starting lineup and is still rewarding players for being shit.

Some of these players were in this very situation before, with the manager with one foot out the door. They didn’t/couldn’t play for Sarri, they didn’t play for this club’s legend in Frank Lampard, ultimately they didn’t play for a Champions League winning manager in Thomas Tuchel, but they are playing for Graham Potter. Whatever you might think of the man, he has achieved something we didn’t have for the past decade. Players actually showing up for the manager and the shirt.

Madueke looked ok but personally I wasn’t overly impressed.

Mudryk looked pretty bad but the can’t tell if it’s cause Cucurella refused to pass to him or he didn’t make him self available to receive passes","Gallagher is a strange player. Hes a raw talent but in the end a bad player. He can't pick a pass out, holds the ball way too long and gives up bad fouls in the middle of the pitch by being on the wrong side of the player because he ball watches. 

He shows flashes of how good he can be, but his end product just isn't there. At least to be in the starting 11 for Chelsea.",Aw we are so shit,"Koulibaly has been so, so poor since he's joined. So lethargic and makes so many clumsy decisions. Can't believe he's the one from the backline I'm most anxious watching, even Humphreys was more composed than him tonight.

Fofana may not have had that many touches in the game, but he did the little things right. He battled for the ball and made sure he tried to keep possession whenever he could, shifting the ball in tight spaces and winning a couple of corners and throw-ins.

Zakaria remains one of our better players this season. Just feel that Gallagher is too rash. Yes, he runs around a lot, but he makes needless fouls and gets cautioned as a result of that.","Please someone make this make sense! I was actually screaming at the tv from frustrations! We don't play forward at all! Most of the players are playing like they are doing us a favour. No passion, no pressure, no work rate. It's just so stale that it makes me mad.","We lost 1-0 to the champions because our keeper didn’t go for a ball and let it go to the back post where Mahrez was. We had two injuries in the first 5 minutes. Yeah, all Potter’s fault.

How can anyone look at our squad and there’s and say we should have been competitive? We’ve been devastated by injuries, turmoil, and bad press and your takeaway is Potter’s the problem? Maybe he isn’t the solution but my god our squad in its current state is well and truly shocking. We need multiple transfer windows to fix this.","A win is a win. I was excited by the first half performance, second half was more of what we’re used to. We have to sort the finishing out, but that’s a pipe dream at this point. Hopefully we can build on this","Genuinely ridiculous that we sacked Tuchel to play this dreary football, everyone has regressed",We started the game with 6 centermids playing. If we're going to use a wingback system we need wingbacks and wingers not #8's who can score an occasional goal or two,"That loss has to fall on Potter more than anything…his team selection was a defensive liability to begin with. So many attackers on the field and the bench…no changes to the midfield with #5 on the bench (more on the sidelines trying to help/motivate his team)…good change at halftime but no personnel changes until it was almost too late. Then ge switched back to the horrible tactic the last 10 mins? Potter over managed and let the occasion get to him. This is going to happen, heck Pep over manages every final he has ever coached…chillwell and Azpi and Jorgino should have been involved sooner (or even at all) because experience matter when there is a lot of emotion in the game. 

I have also never seen a game with so many bad tackles from behind. I think I counted 12+ and only 2 cards???? Both teams tackled like amateurs for most of the game and the ref just allowed it. No accumulation of fouls cards given…

Brighton deserved to win…period and three massive mistakes that led to goals…you deserve to win when you convert the other teams mistakes and Brighton did that very very well today. 

Kudos to Brighton. They are a really good team and deserve the success they are having…but I hope Potter looks inward first when he tries to figure out how the wheels came off so easily and so quickly. Playing so many players out of position just so you can start the game with 5 attackers is not world class football, it’s video game football, and it will never work at the level Chelsea are expected to play at, period. 

I believe Potter is humble enough, I just hope this isn’t an indicator of how he handles bigger occasions.",I knew we would concede after the penalty as soon as they started throwing bodies forward I knew we was going to come unstuck. We cannot see a game out its one of our worst traits.,"God help this club if we have to rely on Azpi, RLC, Kai, Jorginho all season",3 losses in a row…,Was it a technical issue in the broadcast or an iPhone really rang at the half time on the stadium speakers? The fans also seemed to react to it.,There's only so far that UCL win from 2021 is going to take Tuchel. This is frighteningly bad stuff.,When will we ever had game where I can comfortably sit back and enjoy the performance?,"Aubameyang showing what a clinical striker is capable of. He hasn't really shown much in the game but scores from a half chance, breathing life back into us.

Other than the dodgy handball, Thiago Silva has been great, without him we would be a complete disaster playing out from the back. As unfortunate as it is, he is our best playmaker and most progressive deep passer. Fofana hasn't really shown anything, defensively his positioning is off/poor.

Jorginho was a disaster.  He hides from the ball while we have possession, he follows his marker around and then hides and cuts passing lanes towards him. When he does receive the ball he is completely uninspiring and passes to TS/Fofana hoping they deal with it. Off the ball he is extremely weak, honestly a traffic cone. Our midfield gets run though like butter on a frying pan. When RLC came on it completely changed, I am not saying he was fantastic but he played the role much better, our midfield looked solid and he played passes  forward, was open to receive it and  taking pressure off everyone else around him.

Havertz was a complete ghost. Does not deserve to start, he's been bad for so many games in a row. Mount was not good but was at least in the game.

Chilwell was also noticeably poor, when Zaha switched from James to his side Palace became threatening again. Chilly wasn't good defensively and was poor on  the  ball, showing no right foot or forward passing ability. IMO Cucurella still starts.

Gallagher got us the 3 points, great individual effort from him.","Connor or mount for motm, personally would go for Connor, he was very good today","Frustrating match, we shot out of the cannon early but looked flat at stretches of the game. For me Azpi and J5 are mistakes for that many minutes. 

Although, I think some of the attacking patterns looked encouraging and I have faith that GP can continue to press his ideas into this team. 

That said, this opponent, like Ganked Zagreb was, is a low quality side that we should be handling with ease at home. To lose points, regardless of the managerial situation, is hugely disappointing for a team of our caliber. 

Godspeed Mr Potter.",Games like last night show that when we’re at our best we can really come toe to toe with some of the best teams in the world so it’s such a shame that most weeks we look nowhere near as strong. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction,Quite dissapointment about Gallagher. He had 2-3 clear chances but no more goals due missing of shoulder check.

From a long term perspective, we looked good. Probably the best we've looked in months. We deserved to win, and we were very unlucky on a number of occasions. Pretty much everyone put in a decent show, most put in a good performance - especially the defenders. (Well done KK).

However, short term perspective, we're in for a rough 4-5 months. Until we get a striker in, as good as we looked tonight, we'll win shite all.","What a great result. I was worried coming into this game after losing 2-1 to this powerful Fulham team last month. Potter really has us looking dangerous, coherent, and totally not chaotic throughout all regions of the pitch.

I’m honestly not sure if this is worse football than Lampard’s time with us. We’ve looked and have objectively been horrendous all year, but guess what, there exists a possibility that both the team and manager suck. Meanwhile, majority will blame one or the other when it’s a combination. 

Thankfully, our new signings looked quite good! Now, hopefully we can take a good long look at the manager situation until the end of the season after we finish bottom half of the table with absolutely nothing but embarrassment.","Who on this team has a winning mentality?

NOT GOOD","120 is technically too much for a player, but we absolutely don’t create chances. Enzo is not worth €120m, but if he’s half as good for us as he is for Benfica, he’d be worth a hell of a lot more for us than that","Sorry but at this point, these injuries are way too many way too often, something is going on at the medical level of the club, this doesn't make sense.

Otherwise, great game, really happy with the performance although we should have won by a bigger margin but Ill take it",I miss tuchel. Not entirely potter’s fault but this team is so bad. Tuchel made them look like world beaters…,Is there any chance that we can bring Tuchel back ? Can this drama happen?,"Well, that was fucking dreadful.

Pretty boring. This fixture has become a boring affair over the past couple years. Lucky to get the penalty, what was McTominay thinking? But other than that, eh. Subs could have came on earlier. United did pretty well the first half, but the second half they didn’t have that same rhythm. The 5atb makes for a pretty boring play. We couldn’t hold the lead with 4 minutes left lmao",We miss Kante a lot. We need a ball winning midfielder to replace him in Jan be it Edson Alvarez or Sangare or who ever.

> Tuchel wanted a centre-back, specifically Germany international Antonio Rudiger of Chelsea. Leonardo wanted a defensive midfielder, so he signed one in Danilo Pereira. To make a point, Tuchel played him at centre-back, which was both childish and unnecessary. Once Leonardo told the media in October that Tuchel's comments and attitude were damaging for the club, it was evident his days were numbered.     
      
. . .     
       
  
>Tuchel's biggest problem is that he never really managed to give his PSG team a genuine identity. The style of play this season was poor; PSG were never convincing, and there were no patterns or themes to their style of play.         
. . .       
      
       
>Even the dressing room and the key players were not all that disappointed he was dismissed. There was a time when he had the full support of his squad, but he fell out with Mbappe last year and some of his questionable tactical decisions lost him a lot of credit.

On another day, at least one of the Ziyech, Broja, James or Mount chances would have gone in.

It’s not that I was expecting a title challenge. Not in the slightest. But we look bereft of ideas anytime we step onto the field and my patience is beginning to wear on Tuchel - in particularly when both Timo and Lukaku have come out in recent weeks claiming his ideas failed to get the best out of them. Excluding Raheem, not a single attacker of ours who has worked with Tuchel over an extended period has come out looking better.

I’m aware there’s a lot of changes. But literally every position on the field from goalkeeping to general defending, to set-piece defending, to creating from midfield and work ethic from midfield to general attack play - nothing has looked positive.

We look like a mid-table side, and a re getting the results expected of a mid-table side.",Very lucky to get away with 3 points. We really weren't great. Looked much better when Chilwell came on but we really need some serious changes before we look at all convincing and we need them quickly.,"So apparently it’s not Potterball but ReeceJamesball - wtf, we lose him and immediately go from high press, quick movements back to this disjointed shit?",Trail by fire at the end for Trev but a good game from him. Conor can’t be making those challenges. Reece should no longer be allowed to play RCB even if it means Ampadu behind him., Idk I think the first goal came quite a bit after Havertz challenge but how is the hair pull right before the second goal not a foul? Like the man got tugged to the ground by his hair :/,"This team, like most teams frankly, play like absolute shit when they don’t have confidence in the keeper.
We saw it with Kepa at the end of Franks tenure and we’re seeing it now with Mendy. 

Since the team has trouble believing that Mendy will do his job, they’re overextending in the back and making poorer and poorer decisions. 

Mendy needs to sit a game or two. He’s been off his game since January and it’s absolutely costing the team points."

Unless we have our world class wing backs the 3atb wont work against a low block, high pressing team. RLC only works as a wingback against teams that dont sit back because he can use physical traits to exploit the spaces left behind. Against a low block he has to rely on passing, crossing, and good decision making which arent his strong suits.

With our world class wing back out due to injury, why not play a 4atb and allow our width to come from attacking wingers? 

I dont think RLC was bad today btw, it's just frustrating to watch because he could've been better used today to take advantage of his size in the middle or supporting the wings rather than being the width",Fact of the day: Potter has failed to reach as many finals as Tuchel. It only took him two months. Progress.,"We are so lucky to have so many potential managers  and specialists on every topic here in this subreddit.

Because when we bought him we promised him a big role in the team, he came as a leader, we surely made him promises etc. That's why he is starting after continuous shit performances now and that's why even when he is bad in a game he is subbed far too late. We sub other players and keep him as long as we can. I have no proof of this, so rightly I am stupid right now but, I personally have no doubt that we don't want him complaining.","Wonder if anyone will pay even 30m for Cucu now. Chilly or Alonso would have taken the shot at that chance he got around the box. Also so many times ran at wrong positions when opposition was attacking leaving our other defenders to defend alone, like that time when he ran inside our box when the opposition was on the wings, and had to come back running but cross was already made. Not good as a CB, not good in air or on setpeices.

The player is not that bad, but when we had Chilly and had Maatsen and do play wingers occasionally as wingbacks, he wasn't worth buying and at that ridiculous price, but because it isn't Marina, no complaints. I hate saying this again and again, but my complaint is more on the decision to sign him, than Cucu himself.","Pros: Hall and Ziyech looked good, albeit hall missing two goals. 

One less competition that they weren’t going to win, to worry about. 

Many players rested (rested?) for Saturday’s match against Newcastle, who are on fire. 

Cons:

They looked terrible. Nowhere near as bad as the game v arse, but terrible. 

KK is too slow for this league. He can time maybe half of his tackles properly. He’s good carrying the ball, but from a defensive standpoint, I’m worried. 

I love watching RLC play but I have no idea where his best position is. I don’t think he’ll feature next season. He needs to go to a mid table team and he’ll do well there. Had a good couple of whips out wide to hall, maybe he needs to be a wide mid in a 442 diamond? Or a 451? 

Pulisic… I don’t know what to say. Thought he looked good at times, then he looked like shit (second goal, wtf are you doing). 

Cucu: wasn’t horrible. Not a 70 mill player. 

Zakaria: didn’t know he was playing until the second half. 

Mendy: same mistakes handling the ball. Boot it down the middle of the field as soon as you get it. That way, there’s less chance it’ll bite you in the ass. 

Top has slipped away. Top 8 slipping with performances like this. Saturday’s game is a not lose.","Kepa, Azpi, Chalobah, Silva, KK, Cucu, Kova, Jorgi, Mount, Sterling and Kai in our next match or I have no idea what’s going on anymore.",Said this last week … Ziyech is a bad apple.

A no.9, obsessed with goals striker","Wouldn’t be too upset to see Kepa get a string of games. Kind of interesting to think about too. Kepa had a steady climb up into the top leagues showing quality, then had a stinker of a season and got benched for Mendy who was a nobody and got hot at the right time. Now Mendy’s fanning out.

Overall though, not good enough to beat BVB",So where are the xG merchants to tell us we should have have had however many goals? Where are the Potter apologists who mouth on about “showing promise”?  Back the manager? Based on what? He’s out of his depth. The team has no identity. You want to back a manager that can’t come up with tactics to beat the last place team in the league.  How shameful.,The best we've played since the season resumed. Just shit luck. My one takeaway from this game is we need to make it a priority to sign Felix on a permanent transfer. He was incredible.,"I'm not sure why we are freezing Auba out.  He wasn't great recently, but we are struggling to score and he was doing well early in the season.  I think he converts the Havertz chance and probably the Fofana one as well.    I think for a team that can't score, he should at least be on the bench as an option","Just curious as I am a somewhat new fan: Does the EPL ever make official statements about the refereeing or VAR decisions? In American pro sports leagues they will sometimes release a statement explaining the decision or sometimes even admitting that it was incorrect.

Jorginho is a traffic cone on defence. 

Kovacic and Gallagher were fairly poor which made it worse.

Can anyone say with any certainty what our ideal first XI looks like? Especially up front. There will be countless opinions over the front 3. 

No coincidence that our backline looked rock solid under Tuchel when everyone knew their place in the squad. But up front it’s been disjointed for years because we don’t know who we want to play where and who we want to start. 

Where should Kai play? Where should Puli play? Who should start out of those two? Where should Mount play? There’s just so much up in the air. Look at the other top sides and it’s clear as day what their ideal lineup is and it becomes easier to rotate when you know who your best are and what specific role they’re playing. We have a lot of Jack of all trades, masters of none types all over the field. All decent at everything but elite at nothing, especially creativity.

What a fucking game,We have an infestation of mediocre players. Bang average on the ball and just make up numbers. A team trying to catch up to City can't have the amount of wasters we have. The success of Potter's time will depend on how long it takes us to realise there's a bunch of players that we just need to get rid of.,"Best game we’ve played all season. For all the Tuchel apologists in here you can’t deny that we scored 3 goals for the first time this season against a talented AC Milan side under Potter. 

Almost everyone impressed, even those who didn’t still had their moments. Mount hasn’t looked that good all season, good for him. RLC gets a lot of slander but he had a nice start today. Let Kante come back and clean up the midfield and I’m very excited for the future. 

P.S. Even though we won, I just can’t help but feel bad for Pulisic. Sorry but players like Broja and Gallagher should not be making appearances over him considering Pulisic’s resume at Chelsea. I still think he should be starting over Mount and Havertz until he loses his form.

I have given him the benefit of the doubt for so long. Injuries to key players etc. I thought he should be judged after a preseason. But now he has most of them returning and also many new toys to play with, but he made the squad play such shit football.

This was the worst game of football I've watched in a while. First half of Chilwell getting bullied forever, midfield overrun and mount invisible, yet no adjustments made.

Tactically, Potter got nothing right despite the players available. I get that James and Silva needs to be rested/protected. But still we should not have been dominated so badly this game.

Never once have I seen us in control under Potter. The pressing etc has been quite lacklustre. Ay really, Potter out.","Played really well, improvements are notable.

Btw, Enzo is nuts, what a signing we had... Mudryk was MIA today (hard to do something with 2 men on you), Madueke was impressive, Badiashile is a monster. Also liked the few minutes of D.D Fofana.

Second, Pulisic getting 12 minutes is a joke. Another game where Havertz is invisible, Sterling misses opportunities, and the midfield is such a disaster that 0 chances are getting created. Pulisic is, objectively, our most dangerous attacker over the last few weeks. Play him. Liked what I saw from Broja, but despite his talent he struggles with decision making. Gallagher had way too many mistakes as well.

That being said, Azpi had a really great game, and Mendy had some nice stops.",Bring back Tommy tuchs,What happened to us after we scored? My blood boils when I see us chasing a game with 20 odd minutes to go and play with absolutely no urgency. Happened far too many teams under TT and saw this again today.

Positives for sure in the performance - RLC and Broja looking excellent, Kepa strong once more, Pulisic looked great through the centre, Chuks looking really good too - but we have to be getting the 3 points here. Especially since we always seem to drop points against United regardless of the lineup we play.",Sick to death of these useless clowns. They’ll be the downfall of Potter unless Boehly stays the course and perseveres because something about the culture of this football club says that it’s okay for players to down tools whenever they fancy it.

Tuchel persists with that 3 atb and its just not working out. We lack creativity in the middle and the attackers become isolated. Why not just use a tactic that fits the players you have now and postpone your useless tactics until you've obtained all the type of players you want ?

Attack looks really bad, Gallagher hasn’t played a good minute for Chelsea yet, and our defending on set pieces is absolute shit. Mendy has fallen off massively since coming back from AFCON and he makes a good shot stopping save here and there but that’s all he’s good for. Can’t collect crosses despite being the tallest player on the pitch, can’t distribute. It’s a problem, just one of the many we have now. Could be a huge 3 points needed for us.

It's probably the great football mystery how every manager that comes in loves Havertz and seems to neglect Pulisic for some reason, thought the latter looked electric tonight, would've increased our chances to win massively had he started.

That said, if we can’t fucking score it doesn’t matter. They are there for the taking at the Bridge, let’s hope we can take advantage",Potter sucks so hard fucking hell some people are still oblivious,"Now that I’ve calmed down. I think there was massive improvement from us, if you look at the first 15-20 minutes of the game. 

We need to obviously sustain this kind of performance over the full 90. And I think we will. We have so many players either coming back from injury, making their way to full fitness, or are still injured. We had 5 new January signings start today. We have players who are in very bad form and the internet pile-on is not helping. 

From what I saw at the start of the game, the vision is clear, once everyone gets up to speed, I can see us become an elite side. 

Potter might end up being sacked in the summer or next year, but we have to give him a chance, or else we will continue this vicious cycle of inconsistency.","Mudryk is going to be a star.

Needs to improve his decision making/final ball around the box,Chelsea and giving me high blood pressure towards the end of the game name a better duo,😂😂😂,"We need this break.

\- Pulisic has to start.  I have no idea what is going on during training, but for fuck's sake.  He looks 100x livelier than anyone else we have in attack right now.  He had 1 bad decision (\~73min) that entire game and looked like the only person on the pitch that wanted to win.

\- Kai should show a fraction of the passion DURING the game that he did AFTER the game.

\- Potter got the starting lineup all wrong

\- Biggest hot take of all?  Lewis Hall had at least 2 key mistakes.  I see so many people saying he played great... and he did *mostly.*  But he also fell asleep on the scored goal and almost fell asleep again before Gallagher had to bail him out.

KK is a bust.  Cucu is a bust.

I think Sterling and Auba are fine, but until we get anyone on the pitch who can beat a press or distribute out of our back line (besides Silva), we are fucked.

This season is done.  Come back from WC.  Cut the fat.  Start over.","Potter gambled and lost, but the guys on the pitch are more to blame than his tactics. Thiago was horrendous in the beginning; bailing out his own mistake, miss kicked a simple pass that lead to the first goal. Brighton smelled blood in the water and went for the jugular. Sterling and Pulisic aren't excuses for the collapse we witnessed. The first 2 goals conceded were from our own doing. No Cucu getting beat in iso 1v1s. +20/25min in after going 2 goals down you could see what Potter was aiming for, winning the ball further up the pitch, pressing high. Unfortunately we don't have the quality to do that consistently yet.


Injuries have taken their toll again. Our backline is at partial availability which means Cucu is going to play at lcb instead of being 1 to 1 substitute for Chilwell. Get used to it. Potter is smart not to run Chilwell, especially given his potential involvement during the world cup. Lose Chilwell then we'll have to listen to more idiots moan about Sterling at lwb as if we have options.

Our right side is just hit or miss without RJ.  RLC is at his peak inconsistency, and its frustrating to watch because the best of him just a heavy touch or sprints away from being reliable. Just like Chilwell, our midfield is gunna be rotated whether we like it or not. We only have RLC, Jorgi, Kova for the season.


Shout out too Kova, Kepa, Thiago's goal line clearances, Kai, Gallagher, Chalobah, and Mount. They all had good if not better games today. Cucu did well enough all things considered (minimal help from the lw/lwb). The hate recieves is disproportionate to his performances.","Why does it feel like a loss, we didn't play that well till the Kova sub first half. Didn't really create many chances at all. Definitely think it's a pen",Puli was miles better than almost everybody on the pitch when he came on,"Potter done pissed my tf in this match.

Why tf did Ziyech and Broja have to come off? And especially for two players in Mount and Sterling who've been undoubtedly GARBAGE all season bar a few games? Broja added pace to our attack and Ziyech was cooking for about 15 minutes until he got subbed, laughable subs.

And Hall why was he taken off? He was comfortably one if our better players but because he's a youth prospect he had to get taken off?

Lastly, how tf did RLC see more than 45 minutes nevervmind the full 90? He was trash from minute 1 right until the final whistle and Potter should've taken him off for Hutchinson as soon as we went 2-0 down.

This was a disgraceful cowardly performance by Potter and I'm not impressed at all

A huge positive was Hall tho and I hope to see plenty more of him this season",Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,"Ziyech, although not solely responsible for this result can not get more minutes. That was a shocking display, not of being a bit off, but one of total indifference. He has clearly checked out.",I assumed this match was starting around now and I open reddit to see the post match discussion whoops,"We had no shape the entire game, couldn't keep the ball for more than 5 minutes, when we broke palace press there's no one to pass to in the vicinity, everyone just seems to go as far away from the ball and as far wide as possible while attacking, can't play out from the back, can't press and still can't create chances, it's hoofballs and inshallah and Reece James fc",How do people in the uk live through games not being shown on tv? Like wtf,"Just got a chance to watch the game, you'd think we were playing the worst game of the season the way people were reacting on this sub. Not the best game at all but there's a lot of positives to take from less than 1 week with Potter. 

I'm surprised why he rotated Fofana out though. You could justify K2 because he hasn't adapted the best but Fofana had 2 solid outings and he was rotated for Azpi who was arguably at fault for the goal.","Mount was really good today as well, lets hope he keeps performing.",I subscribe to Arrizabalaga redemption arc,,If havertz starts next week I’m gonna throw a fucking tantrum.

78,We didn't deserve Tuchel,"Shoutout to all the body language experts who insisted the team had given up on Potter and all the ""fans"" who were rooting for Chelsea to lose these last two games.

Great result, great effort.",Happy for the win. Not the best performance but who cares. Miserable people will continue to be miserable.,"It’s not about Potter’s tactics. It’s about his passivity. Dressing room needs a strong mentality to turn them around, not a poker face that sits on the bench for 90 minutes and doesn’t argue for situations like we had with the VAR incident vs West Ham. 

Team is lost, they have no desire to fight.",Second game in a row that Mudryk being lazy defensively has played a big part in the goal we’ve conceded. They need to make it clear to him that the competitions we play in are too good for a winger to not put in a shift when we are out of possession,Andrey Santos will get us cooking just be patient guys. Up the blues!,"My take but I thought we looked brilliant for the first 20 or so minutes. In total I thought the chances we created were outstanding. The speed in this team is crazy. Enzo just makes some incredible passes. Defense was really good. One switch off by James lead to the goal by West Ham. That’s a bummer. 

Looking at this team so many pieces are there. The midfield looks a lot better. So many creative players but we don’t have a finisher. That’s not Havertz. We need a guy up front to complement what is happening behind him. The lack of connection between Mudryk - Cucca was weird. Chilwell looked great when he came in. His match fitness must not be 💯 yet. 

Obviously the handball sucked but that probably  makes us even for the really bad call in the first half of this fixture earlier this season when we got 3 points we didn’t deserve.",[deleted],"Felix was obviously good, but braindead tackle. Hurts to think how much he’s costing us while being suspended.

Unfortunately not much good to say about our defence today.

Koulibaly was dreadful, not sure if he’s just shocked by the pace of EPL but really not up to par today. Azpi tried but unfortunately doesn’t have the pace to keep up - not really much he can do about that. Questionable decision by the club to ?extend at the same salary. Chalobah didn’t have a good showing, always looked a touch panicked and out of place. Hall obviously tried but showed his immaturity at this level - doesn’t seem to know when to tackle/intercept, ?partially attributable to not being a defender by trade

Kepa seems to have some strange mental block where if he has to make a decision he looks awful, but can come up with some great reflex saves. Still not convincing for a first team spot.

Kai showed some promising signs of a link up with Felix. Ran hard and worked with the scraps he got. Felt he should’ve done better with the chance 2 minutes in, also when he unfortunately ran the ball out of play. The problem with being a striker on our team is a) you must either be able to bully defenders and be technical enough to keep the ball while doing so (Drogba) or b) create for yourself with your technical ability to a certain degree (Kane/Aguero). These are rare to find though.

Edit - Liked what little we did see from Carney again. Silver lining for this season potentially? Might not have seen much of him if we were playing to our peak","Potter isn't doing himself any favours and I'm not currently impressed with him, but I'm still willing to give him time. That will all change tho if he continues to play the passion merchant twins.

Gallagher and Mount lack any ability to dribble, retain possession and play between the lines, absolutely BANG AVERAGE players who are stealing a living at this level.

It's honestly not fair that MUCH superior talents in Hall and Chuk have to take a back seat to those clowns and if Potter continues to do so, he can fuck off from the club.

Also Koulibaly has been shit all season and needs to see bench for a hot minute.","The amount of backward passes I saw today was idiotic. God we are bad at the moment. Zero creativity, either we get lucky or we lose","Played well against City tbf, expected much worse. Tired of all the people asking for a rebuild and to give youth experience but don't wanna go through the tough periods. Literally look at arteta and how shit they'd been for two years and we also have 10 players out with shit players like auba at the club. Idk, people need to start being realistic because the football under tuchel was shit too near his end. Not this bad but it was still boring and nothing was happening.",A wet mop would have done a better job officiating this match,"That was literally a cardio session for us. no interest in scoring, making a few passes, playing aggressively. man i miss Rudiger too","I love how people are saying it's not Potter's fault when he changed the formation like 3-4 times in the second half and just prays it works. He was completely clueless. Players aren't doing themselves a favor, but definitely Potter is clueless. I see no difference between Potter and Lampard in terms of management, not sure what the hype about him was.",What has happened to Mendy like I get he has bad distribution but he can’t help but try to assist the other team anytime he touches the ball!,"Didnt deserve to win that game but fucking hell, how do u lose control of the game at the end when u need it the most","I feel like I’ve said this in the last 5 post match threads… PULISIC HAS TO START. I don’t care if it’s Sterling, Havertz, Mount, or whoever, someone has to sit so Pulisic can get some game time. Looked like he was playing for his life today. Absolutely sensational.

Broja was also incredible. Needs some fine tuning and a checkup on his decision making, but the talent is clearly there.

Another game where Kepa saved us a point. He has seriously been world class since he took over.","- City GK Ortega was insane today. Doesn’t help that we don’t have clinical finishers.

- KK has been such an underwhelming buy. Im hopeful that KK will come good eventually  but at the moment he is dreadful. I don’t understand what it is but his head doesn’t seem in the game most times.

- Team was looking good until city scored an easily preventable first goal and we just fell apart after that. But our finishing and decision making stays abysmal

- I think people need to let go of their emotions and face the reality that Pulisic, Ziyech, Havertz need to go. At the very least 2 of them need to be out the door asap. Those 3 + sterling and mount,  we cant have so many forwards who struggle to finish their chances.

- Simply put, our squad is not of the quality that we strive to be and TT overachieved with this squad.

- Regarding RLC, he is not a winger , he lacks the qualities to play out wide effectively and therefore isn’t much of a threat on the flanks",We are playing PSG aren't we.....,Watching Jorginho go back to Kepa with 10 seconds left would be all you needed to watch to understand how this game went.,Havertz needs to try and have a go more often.,After a shaky start Fofana was excellent.

Hopefully we're less shite from now on.",mount's second goal was much much sexier than my ex,Thought azpi was immense,Anthony Taylor didn't rule it a foul because he is fucking bald and doesn't know the feeling of getting his hair pulled.,"The lack of DOF has led to a situation where our roster has fantastic players, yet minimal synergy. It’s a shame that tactical decisions made to cover up a players weaknesses cannot be well covered elsewhere due to someone else’s strengths, or more frustratingly due to injury.

Whether it’s losing a midfielder to play 3atb to cover Thiago Silva’s lack of mobility. And sacrificing penetrative through balls to our forwards and goal threat from outside the box when we play with any Jorgi/Kova, and to a lesser extent Kante, because they’re the only CM options we have who can reliably play in 2 man midfields. Which forces us to play without attacking mid / second striker which is almost all our ‘forward’ players most ideal position.

Kante injured is a terrible loss. He does so much work to cover for others shortcomings; he’s the glue which has allowed this decently incompatible roster (based on style, not spirit) to be balanced enough to score goals whilst keeping them out at our end. Kova has this effect too, though not as quite as strong because he offers even less goal threat. But he’s out too, so we’re then left with only Jorgi to play comfortably in a 2. Gallagher is not ready yet for a pairing, especially against a strong press, and really should be let loose higher up the field to press himself.
. 

Todays game showed the cracks in our shield wall. Leeds were fantastic in the press and were quick to move the ball away from the takeover so that our press would be late and leave our back line exposed. We were unable to do this successfully on a consistent basis. Nor were we clinical enough with the nice chances we did create.

Different game, same story. We’re a great side at full strength. But when a key piece or 2 are unavailable, we become unbalanced extremely quickly. A good DOF would theoretically identify these pain points, which we have not had."

Shoutouts to Wes and Chilly.

They’ve been much better at the back—they’ve allowed 16 goals in 15 matches in that span. Their record in that time is 2-4-9 across all competitions. That’s over 15 weeks, including the World Cup break. Extrapolated to a full season, that’s a record of 5-10-23 in 38 games, with 15 GF and 40 GA for 25 total points, which is top five for GA and bottom 5 for goals scored.

To follow the rules like a holy bible to the point where you leave no room for subjectivity leads to a game where all the players have to walk on eggshells and it produces such a dull and boring game. No physicality allowed and on top of that he gave fouls for legitimate tackles amongst other glaring mistakes. That ref should not be getting any more CL games for the sake of the sport.",,"Tuchel needs to crumple up his current system and throw it in the garbage.

We looked great last season with him and Reece bombing down the wings, if we can get back to that we might have some attacking threat again.

I thought we were fired up in the first 20, we played wel and got the goal we wanted. The players thought they could drop off and that gave Southampton an advantage.

Southampton seemed to know how to beat us too. They swarmed the midfield, knowing that Jorginho wouldn’t be able to cope with the pressure. This gave a lot of balls away to Southampton. My take is we really miss n’golo kante, he wins a lot of 2nd balls for us and is vital to how we play.

Another way Southampton exposed us was by using Che Adams’s physicality to overturn balls for Southampton. He won almost every duel he had against Thiago Silva and this meant that Southampton had an easy way out.

Overall, our midfield was dominated and we need a proper DM in our squad who can tackle, play passes and can close oppositions down. The saints played through us mainly due to Jorginho and the fact we only play with two in midfield.","Glad for the win, even though we were just bad everywhere. Chilwell’s goal was ice cold!

Super Tommy Tuchel indeed.","Embarrassing referring but how can we let a last min header like that is even more embarrassing. There was like 3 spurs players who had an open header it’s crazy. 

Also, I felt like mendy needs to be more commanding in the penalty box in corner kicks and what not. He seems very timid","Our attack would look a lot better with real wingers. Go to a back 4. Play real wingers: sterling and pulisic on the outside. Let mount be a 10 or 8. Id like to see broja up top. Thats a lot of speed on the outside and up top. Mount in the midfield will at least give us someone who will try to advance the ball quickly and is capable of that and linkup play. He could take shots from just outside the box as well. Plus we'd have cucu/chillwell and james overlapping.

The problem with tuchel's system is that it only works well at times really cuz of 1 player. That's Reece James at wingback. He excels at taking shots and crossing in from the positions he gets into. But everyone else suffers. James can still make massive offensive contributions as a true right back. And everyone else will be put in better positions offensively as well with more support up the field. We rely on our wingbacks so much to feature in this system, and sometimes we don't even play Reece at RWB. And while cucu is a great player, as is chilly, they are both not guys who should feature in having the ball the most and being put into our most dangerous attacking positions more than anyone else. They'd be much better utilized in supporting the attack in the way outside fullbacks do instead of featuring in it.

Yes it seems to help defensively, but with all the possesion we have, teams can sit back and wait for a mistake in possesion and some teams have the pressing skillset to pressure us into a mistake like leeds and then score. Or score on set pieces which we seem to suck at defending this year. We are then in trouble when we need to respond with a goal of our own because our attack is hot garbage most of the time unless Reece decides to save us and put one home as a wingback.

Kante and kovacic can also sometimes rescue our attack either by kante destroying opposition's possession and leading a break, or kovacic quickly dribbling the ball down the opposition's throat, but now we don't have either of those guys and their injury history suggests they can't be relied upon.

I hope we make a change in system"

I don't understand potter's deal with puli either, puli is more proven and in better form than any of the subs and he gets about 5-10 minutes when you factor in time wasting.

He keeps running RLC out as if Chelsea needs an additional connector, but Villa kept finding counter-attacks underneath RLC.


Fans are getting excited about the good RLC moments - and there have been a few to be fair. Especially when he had Reece James protecting him. But he also needs to be held responsible every time he drifts forward and the ball gets cut out underneath him. RLC is creating variance in the midfield. The good kind as well as the bad. But Chelsea has better talent than Brighton and doesn't need to do that. Potter needs to get past this idea that the team won't work without the sort of players that were necessary to make his lesser rosters function.

I know Pulisic played trash, but Sterling needs a rest now. Maybe a start will help Pulisic get some rhythm and then who knows. Bench Ziyech permanently, his mind is clearly set on Ajax. Rotate Chilly and Cucu depending on whether we are chasing or defending a game. Mount needs a rest too, so slowly ease him back in and give him his confidence.

I have faith. We've been in a real slump for a while, but a change in formation and personnel might do the trick. Tuchel needs to be vocal and call players out, let them know he's not afraid to bench them and make them prove themselves to him all over again.

Azpi’s best days are behind him but when he played he provided crosses from inside and overlapped Reece at times.

What has Potter been doing? This is worse than Andre Villas Boas, FFS.

If they are all already playing, is because Potter has been doing fuck all with the players he already had.

It’s genuinely so hard to watch. Need to play the youth the rest of the season and need to offload a large portion of our squad this summer. Only 4 players of our current “spine” I wanna see here next season are Kante, Reece, Silva, and Kovacic",no way we are making top4 in this state. its obvious that we have become a midtable team. #disillusional,"Some positive signs, but still feels really bad. We can’t create chances at all outside of counters. Zakaria was great though.","Better than most of what we've seen so far this season, but didn't like how much control and territory we ceded in the second half, regardless of injuries. Still though, it's an improvement.

Continues to feel like midfield is where we should be focusing our efforts in the upcoming windows. I like Zakaria, but he's not starter quality here and we should not be relying on Jorginho as much as we do.

Also, we might have to start doing a MOTMOTTS (Thiago Silva) soon. He's incredible.","This scoreline really flatters us. If it weren't for the backline bailing us out time and again this could've been ugly.


To be dominated at home like this is embarrassing. There's just no drive to be seen in the players.","I’m really not sure what the hype around Gallagher is. He works very hard, but he’s so clunky is his touches and passing. Chalobah is a good defender, but he invites so much pressure. 

I think Potter needs to figure out the movement off the ball. No one is willing to move and provide space for others around them. They all wait while someone dribbles and looks to lay off the ball to them. The only person who I see making runs is Havertz. Now this comes to my second point; the movement off the ball can be there, but something quite glaring is the lack of quality in the pass. Whether it’s a cross, a lob, a ping, or just on the ground, the quality has been poor. Again, this might be because there’s hardly any movement meaning these passes are harder to hit to perfection and they’re too predictable. 

I don’t care what everyone else says, I feel the players are just unmotivated with the World Cup coming up. Hopefully this improves once it’s over, but some very clear signs pointing to a lack of buy-in that Potter is getting from the squad.","Excellent performance! 10/10

Can’t say Southampton didn’t deserve it when they had more chances and chances on target at the end of the game; work to do ahead of a must-win London derby this Saturday

Some side notes:
- Ziyech was somewhat of a bright spot (again up until the goal) and provided some more fluidity in our attacking play
- Broja also a bright spot in the limited minutes he had (strong effort and willingness as expected from a sub)
- Pulisic the complete opposite 
- Pls god let Kovacic be fit for the whole season, man had more effect on our midfield alone in 45 minutes than any of our other midfielders in the past 4 games

Chelsea had about 10 corners in the first half and probably 6 or 7 just hit the first man instantly.,"We won, Barca currently down 2. Great fking day so far",Havertz turned into prime Drogba with the hold up play and shithousery,These NBC commentators are cowards for glossing over the Cucurella hair pull as if it's not a big deal.,"Our problem isn’t scoring chances, we simply don’t create enough of them. So, if we know we aren’t getting anywhere with de Jong, we should go for both Fofana and Tielemans and send a deadwood or two (and a pile of cash) the other way to Leicester. 
I don’t think we have a reliable option to fill in for either Kante or Kova, especially when they’re both out, and as long as we don’t sort that out we should be prepared to see the odd atrocious performance like today’s every now and again."
85,What exactly does Kai offer to this team anymore? I’d rather start datro fofana. At least he’s quick to react.,"![gif](giphy|m9jFnJOoQ3hWJ6Muaa|downsized)

Why can’t we win a game,"Played ok, but the attitude was so negative. Potter clearly happy with a draw when 1 point really doesn’t help us. Liverpool was probably the worst team we’ve played all season and we’re there for the taking but Potter didn’t have the guts to go for it",Season is cursed man,At least there’ll be a good couple of days of ranty podcast content. Fuck me that’s ruined a chilled Sunday,Buying lukaku for 100m and loaning him back to the club you bought him from and replacing him with a washed arsenal reject is like bartomeu levels of management clowenery. I honestly forgot lukaku existed until he piped up with another interview,"I mean how great was Zakaria? Saw some eye-watering, beautiful ball controls throughout the entirety of the game",This game is going to be much easier for defenders now that you can pull attackers by their shirts.  Game changer.,"Firstly I miss TT big style, I hope potter works out but I miss the man.

Secondly I think today showed where the problems are again, too many players technically lacking and wingers with no ability to beat a man, we offer 0 penetration as a result, look at that arsenal midfield and they can all play a good pass the wingers have pace or tricks 

Connor Gallagher I really hope has a fantastic career but with his technical deficiency I can't see it being at Chelsea, he's a passion merchant who looks like Bambi on ice every time he gets the ball.

Mason was invisible today and auba and sterling offer nothing on the wings right now.

Rlc again just not Chelsea quality, I love seeing these academy lads play but they're just not of the standard needed.

Potter needs to use his time coaching better ideas, cause right now the team has none.","![gif](giphy|MCGMIhGCOnfXL551VN|downsized)

Just want him back","Awful, embarrassing, disgraceful performance

Spending 270m and bought their manager, coaches and first choice leftback and lose in such ugly fashion is just a fucking disgraceful

4 games in a row we played like shit and should have lost all of them if Kepa didn’t have a heroic performance in those games

I am seriously doubting Potter’s ability to lead us to champions league or league titles, he makes little to no adjustment despite we keep conceding easy chances because of passing out from the back and getting dominated in the midfield, getting exploited in full back position because he stubbornly using wingers as full back/wing back

Maybe this job is too big for Potter","Sterling and Cucu becoming a problem, if won't be played in starting 11, we might be looking very strong in Potter transformation. United had really good record recently and as much as dissapointed I am it's not that bad result.",Team looked so much better after the subs came on.,"Has this thread reached the low point of being happy just because spurs and arsenal also lost? And that it’s a “good day” because we will have less fixture congestion and no injuries?

Are you morons this complacent to accept this as any form of success? This is 1) our best chance at a trophy 2) a loss to a rival that has so far surpassed us it isn’t even funny and 3) another example of tactical ineptitude from potter and squad weaknesses. It’s a perfect storm of 8th place and a descent towards mediocrity that many clubs before us have taken. Wake up",Correct,All of a sudden this looks like a tough CL group when we should be walking it.,"We have a serious lack of athleticism and physicality, and it’s really glaring vs big, physical sides like Salzburg and Brentford. Fofana, Koulibaly, and Reece coming back will help but it’s really nerve wracking especially with set pieces late on.",It's nice to be on the right side of game scripting for once.,"I am happy Broja scored his first goal!

All hail Lord Tuchel!",Next game is a perfect one to put Kepa in and see if he can handle the pressure. We need to sit Mendy for a game.

86,"I was really hoping to give Potter a chance. I’m not usually one to call for a sacking but unfortunately I think he has to go. We lack identity on the pitch, there’s no pattern of play! We’re literally in relegation form, I genuinely can’t see us winning another game this season",If we win the champions league they gotta make bohely ball a real movie,We were dreadful in open play. Lucky that Leeds were even fucking worse,"If you’re not potter out by now, you’re deluded",I think there's no denying the scoring curse Chelsea has is 100% real. No matter what player or manager we have it still happens. People put that blue shirt on and just cannot score.,"Our performance isn't much of a surprise. 

Players are not used to each other, and players having different fitness levels.

Will be like that for a while.",Potter Out,"That is a tie I personally view as a win. 

Our attack looked exciting with Mudryk, and we looked more lively than we have in weeks past. You can see the vision and things starting to take shape under Potter, and we still are missing so many key pieces with injury. 

Also, Cucu quietly had a very solid game.",Badiashile HAS to start against palace. Same with Chuk.,"Makes no sense sacking Potter, he still deserves next season in my opinion. But still, he needs to get his head together and not crack. 

As for Boehly, if you have players like Enzo and Gvardiol STILL wanting us in this state shut up and pay the damn money",The amount of money this club spends for absolutely zero return on investment is actually impressive. Club would literally be better off just burning all that money. At least the fire would keep some people warm during the winter.,"Anyone else get a smile seeing three academy lads coming on?.  Thought Chucky improved when they came on.
Hall at left back going forward i would much prefer.",Based Potter.,"Let’s get this out of the way, Cucurella is a 10m defender at best.",Potter isn't the guy.,"Embarrassing, WTF is with these FIFA lineups. It's not a good look when the manager is having to completely readjust at half time or before because the setup has started so poorly. Players like Sterling and Cucu are looking like complete busts but how they're being used is doing them no favours. 

RLC is the softest big man I've ever seen. He also short circuits anytime he's in the middle and the opponent actually puts on a press. 

Many other weak performances today. No intensity to try to equalize after Havertz pulled one back. 

We could be in big trouble by the time the World Cup comes around with Newcastle, Arsenal and Man City next.",Why is puli rated as the lowest?,would love to see more minutes for carney and i dont wanna see kai for some time,"Once we realize players like Chalobah, Loftus, Sterling, Havertz, Pulisic, and Ziyech are not Chelsea standards is the moment we start competing again for the big trophies. 

We have gotten accustomed to mediocrity and that’s is exactly why we have been utter shit since we’ve won the CL. 

I won’t be exaggerating by saying we need six new starters to improve our team. 

On a side not, Lewis Hall looks like a world-class talent. Completely ran the show against City (albeit it’s their second team) at 18 years of age. I want to see him start, no more of that easing him into the XI. The boy is ready.",Did they? Same gd and same results in h2h. What is the decider then,Shades of the last days of mourinho's most recent shift at the helm,Control of the game collapsed when loftus cheek replaced kovacic. Lucky to get the win with Kepa flapping in the air.,Needed the win. The Kova-Kante-Gallagher midfield is going to cook against one of those poor lower table midfields. Hope we get to see it once or twice this season. Good win for the confidence of our subs which will hopefully push our starters who seem to want to walk the ball into the net.,6 goals over the past 2 matches with 6 different goal scorers. If we can stay consistent that is something that could propel us to actually challenge for titles.,"Is Mason Mount planning to do anything this season or is he going to go under the radar because this sub attacks Ziyech and Pulisic, who get about 15-20 minutes a game?","More of this please! What a win, what a night!",Let us all pray to our various gods for a healthy Reece James.,,"Mendy has been poor for couple of months now. Tuchel needs to start Kepa here and there to challenge Mendy for competition.

Losing Rudiger has been a massive blow for us. Koulibaly is nowhere close to matching the presence of Rudiger in Tuchel’s system. Man, I miss Rudiger.

Reece James is one of the most important player in our squad. He makes such a impact in the pitch. Azpilicueta has had a very bad game and he can’t play RB/RWB.

Jorginho is vulnerable in 4atb. He gets both outmuscled quite easily and outpaced. With Kante alongside him, he can dictate a game but with RLC or Gallagher, he will always be a bad option to start with. I think Kovacic is our best player and we need a DMF alongside him, someone like Rodri. Kovacic will be Gundogan/Silva type of player alongside Rodri.

Our attack is the most talked about topic. We commit less numbers in the box. Broja looked solid when he came on, and we can try giving him some time on CF. We need strength on our attack. Havertz gets outmuscled by everyone and doesn’t win aerial duels. Broja will bring strength and goals but he will need service and this can help to play Sterling and Havertz in their natural position.

About Pulisic, Ziyech,Havertz and Mount. None of them are performing well and reaching their expectations. Mount and Ziyech were good in first 20 minutes of the game. Pulisic doesn’t suit WB position, idk what Tuchel sees in him to play there. He is best when he is dribbling around the box and running at defenses. Havertz needs to be dropped, he always look to pass back and has no confidence. I don’t know what his best position is, but I don’t think he suits to Tuchel’s system. I think Ziyech should one of the front 3 players, he has vision, passing accuracy and creativity. Sterling-Broja-Ziyech can be a good attacking trio. Ziyech and James on the right looks so good.  Mount has a dip in form and he needs time on work on. I still think his best position is as a 8/10 hybrid which Tuchel doesn’t use.

Our set piece has been shit both delivering and defending. We need a strong work on that.

I think our management is to blame for most of the results. We have different players that suit different game style due to sacking of managers. And Tuchel is to blame for not playing players in their best position. With Fofana coming, I think we will be better defensively but we need a DMF ASAP.","I literally was telling my mate ‘watch J5 lose the ball now-‘ and before I finished he lost it and Cornet hit the post. 

Broja is a decent 9 and should be given a chance. Chilwell has proven time again he should start, maybe Cucu can just be his cover. 

Mendy’s very shaky. We were lucky with that VAR call but were owed one at least anyway after that Anthony Taylor debacle.",New manager bounce got us the 3 points today,"Wow what a game. Silva so fucking class! Sterling, Ruben, Reece, Cucurella all IMMENSE. Mendy saving the game multiple times, Chalobah looked really good today, but a couple really questionable plays that hopefully some consistent game time will iron out. Jorginho solid. Kai disappointing and Mason invisible today. Feel bad for Gallagher, feels like he was just over enthusiastic in his tackles trying to force his way into the starting 11. All the subs did what they needed to. We are Chaos FC! Hell of a win to celebrate!",The hair pull has to be one of the most shocking no calls I’ve ever seen,Bench Mendy. No job is safe
87,Potter out,"Looks like something clicked between Potter and Kai regarding his positioning and instructions. Like we finally cracked the code. 

I hope that this can be his role going forward, because he was outstanding.","Fucking finally. Won't need to be depressed for a whole week.

I forgot about Dortmund, shit","Time to go, this is a sinking ship under Potter","I'm seeing the exact same reactions after the 1-0 game vs City

Fucking hell.,"Koulibaly genuinely being one of the worst CBs i’ve seen play for this club after us being linked to him on and off for the last 5 years is the FUNNIEST thing.

Yes a lot of our players and injured, but still. The connectivity between midfield and forwards/offense is so lackluster and uninspired.","Imagine growing up watching us have a midfield of Ballack, Essien, Makelele, Lampard, etc. 

And now I’m sat here watching Jorginho ffs. This club has gone backwards so much in the last 10 years.","If we spend 270m and out of top 4 it would be a bigger laughingstock than Barcelona getting knocked out of the group stage

If Potter is not capable of leading this team to top 4, why should we keep him next year?","kepa fulfilled his role with high enough performance

injuries hit us hard & potter experiment isn't always working",I liked kovacic. Played some direct through passes down the middle and not shy of taking shots now. Good things to come,"My mate is a city fan. He’s just messaged me saying we’ve got to give Potter more time with a bunch of laughing emojis.

It says a bunch when our rivals are calling for us to keep the manager.","optimistically, this means we probably won’t see cucu at lcb any time soon","James the standout player.

Mount lack of form is really starting to be a concern.

Ziyech, what on earth was that? That was proper crap.","Remember when half this sub was saying we wouldnt be going through to the best round after Tuchel was sacked? Because I do. 

Well played tonight, top of the group.","I didn’t think anyone played bad in particular. Not sure why this sub is always looking at performances in black and white. Could some players have done better? Sure! Did some players make mistakes? Sure! But it was not an overall bad performance. In fact, I’d say this is a great start for Potter to work from. We know we have to be more clinical, we have to try to take more risks and not wait for 100% chances, and we have to make sure we actually play a striker as a striker and have him move up into the box instead of doing other people’s work. It wouldn’t hurt us either if our defenders become more hyper-alert and leave less space open. Finally, I think we have to rotate to rest some players who have been starting every match like Havertz, Mount, James, Silva, and Sterling. Some of them in particular look mentally drained / tired. But overall it was a good game with highs and lows. Beautiful goals by both Auba and Gallagher and I hope it makes them feel even more confident. Potter has my full support, but maybe give Ziyech a few minutes too as the guy has only had 2 minutes in the league this season so far.",Well that was quite a fun game to watch. Great win!!,"Tuchel / Potter / Pep / Jesus fucking christ.... It doesnt matter who you put as this manager this team does not have the quality in front of goal to be a competitor.   


Clean house till you find some scorers. This is just woeful.","Motm Reece, dominating EU nights, all is right with the blues 💙",This is amazing. Praying he's ok..,,"Bunch of miserable cunts in here.  I’m upset at the game too, but come on.","bless chilly and kai to get the 3 points.

Broja looked sharp.

Fofana is solid.  That tackle in the last 10 to stop the west ham counter was sensational.

Thought Pulisic did okay for his hour.  Hopefully he can get some of his confidence back and fight for a spot in the team. 

Mendy has some real goose moments.  Wouldn't be angry if he was dropped for a match.

We've got to start scoring goals from forwards.","Potter channeling his inner Conte in the presser

>""If we have to suffer, we will suffer.""",What a gutsy performance from Kai Havertz,Robbed from 2 points and kante pulled a hamstring what a game,"People will jump to criticise players for some reason rightly so.
But Tuchel equally should get the blame too our attacker gets isolated because of no midfielder support.
And our wingback gets stuck with our winger because of the system.

Tuchel started in Chelsea with 2 no 10 and we got lots of joy not only with results but also got so many open play chances. 

Now he just uses a winger who gets stuck with WB results back pass or Cross and Inshallah."
88,"Mount actually looked like a footballer when he came on, dare I say he was good. Was at the centre of the few promising moments we managed to have in the final half an hour. Thats all I will say about this game.","Appreciate that performance from Reece when he clearly wasn’t 100%

This is so similar to the last weeks of Lampard's time here. Out of his league this for Potter - I wish Tuchel was given this squad!,"Ranting and raving isn’t the answer but potter didn’t have to go ballistic, all he had to do is say “the call was incorrect and Chelsea were robbed”",I’ll be positive. I really thought we had some solid attacking and defending those last 30 minutes. Looks very promising with Mudryk,Can we sell Mount?,![gif](giphy|BY8ORoRpnJDXeBNwxg|downsized),"Let’s be honest, we signed an inexperienced manager who’s never known what it’s like to consistently win games week in, week out. Handing him money and expensive players won’t suddenly make him a winner.

He’ll be sacked before the end of the season and end up managing England. If not, next season will be the same. Europa League is going to become a big deal for us.","Midfield today did well. Chuck had some nice passages as did Kova and Zakaria looked exceptional in tight spaces. 

Havertz.... played well in some aspects. Not so well in others. He's an absolute liability in and around the box. His touch from Chuck pass being a prime example. He just has poor decision making. 

Defensively was decent aside from the obvious. Kepa absolutely has to claim the ball and take the blame for that goal. Absolutely zero reason to let it pass him. There was no one around him and the ball wasn't fizzed in. Simply not good enough. 

Disappointing as it was a largely improved performance and outside of the error and a some better product in a couple of key moments we could've won the game. But that's just us atm. Not being able to produce those moments and taking them when we do.",Was it necessary to make the match hard in last 20 minutes because some players wanted to score for themselves ?,"Im just sad.

The problems are clear but the solutions aren't. What do you do if you're TT?

RE-SIGN TUCHEL!","I've been watching this team for a while since 08/09, so nothing too surprising, but it is a familiar feeling of attacking without a purpose and being unable to play through the middle. The biggest issue I have with this team is that no one is seemingly able to play a ball around the corner/on the turn. Seriously. When a player check to receive the ball, when is anyone every playing a reverse ball up the pitch? It is incredibly frustrating as it impedes breaking the lines and disorganizing opposing defensive structures. I know Potter's former Brighton team played that way, so I don't know if it can be fully pinned on him (and also, this is an issue I've had with Chelsea for a while -- in terms of breaking through the middle). Frustrating performance. I liked it much better when we used to regularly beat the top-6 and lose to bottom teams vs. our current state.",Anyone have a replay of the James injury? Didn’t get to watch the game,"It’s weird, I’m not angry or devastated. I’m just extremely embarrassed.

Onto the next one. We need to win to get back on track!","Yeah, we could have done better, but Chukumweka is 18. Mans going to wreck teams in a few years.","Mendy: Solid (on saves) except for a couple of nervy moments and occasional poor distributions.

Koulibaly: played major roles in both goals.

Chalobah: not much.

Cucurella: should improve on his 1v1 marking and know how to force an attacker to his weaker foot. Needs some time in the gym as well.

Loftus-Cheek: still yet to demonstrate what ever his attributes and qualities are. Passing, progression, shooting, dribbling or tenacity? Time to move on from him. Don't want to see him ahead of Zakaria (yeah, I know he's on loan) anytime soon. I think the only reason he played 90 minutes is because it is an almost meaningless game. 

Hall: gave more than an impression for an 18 yr old. Should definitely get better with time. The young lad should be given a chance in the first team, even if it is 10 minutes cameos if we are rebuilding. 

Zakaria: offered a glimpse of what it feels to have a DM. Not the best game, but definitely better than that against Zagreb. The team need at least one of his profile of player. Really.

Kovacic: nothing much from the maestro. Had some nervy moments as well. Will excuse him because of his injuries. Already had an eye in Qatar 

Ziyech: a polarizing player. Not the best by his standard. Offered minimal threat and needs time and space to show off. Don't mind seeing him leave at the end of the season should someone better is on arrival.

Pulisic: hate to admit that he will never be that guy for us. Easily shrugged off the ball and falls often. Should have done better with his first SoT. Carried little threat all game. Some fresh and winger would do us better in his stead.

Broja: young, agile, yet raw and crude. Footwork could be better and needs to keep his head up during play.


Team: Not the worst of performance but it is nice to give a shot on the pitch against one of the most drilled and refined side in the division. Pressing could also be better and more aggressive especially from the forwards, as players easily lost focus, caught ball-watching in dangerous situations. Pleased with the performance, albeit the finishing which was evidently poor. Not pleased with the result though. Surprised no one got injured.",Who got hurt?,Cant wait to hear Tommy boy bitch and moan about his double duties as the club janitor or whatever,I couldn't watch as I was at work; worth watching full game or just highlights?,"Our attack was mistake prone but actually think Palace defends well. They conceded 2 to Arsenal and 4 to City, other than that conceded 1 or 0 before or us.",Of all the academy graduates Reece Mason and CG23 are a class apart. Reece is obvious and Gallagher is starting to show it now after a pretty rough start as a senior Chelsea player.,"Just came back from the Bridge. Never want to see Jorginho play in a Chelsea shirt again.  We cannot play through the middle with him at all, he hides from being a passing option and when does receive he pings it back instantly, he seriously lacks composure. When he does play a pass his technique is awful, it is always fizzed in the air and never gliding on the floor, for a ball playing midfielder its disgraceful. Reece James refuses to pass to him a this point and just dribbles. Kovacic covered every blade of grass and it's no surprise why he will eventually get injured with such a high work rate. We work the ball from one wing to the other just to avoid the midfield at this point.

Chalobah also needs to go on loan.

Amazing performance though, to go down 10 men that early and to come away with the win.","I will probably get down voted to hell, but J5 needs to cut this type of mistakes. It seems like he has 3 to 5 horrible mistakes a season.","Mendys mistake changed the entire course of the game. Gave them more confidence and energy with a home crowd.

He's done everything but kick the ball in the net himself. Played well away from home at one of the fiercest grounds in Europe in what was a very open game.

Watch the attacking intent, the interplay, the tranisitions.. It's being coached well. Defensively a lot more assured the last 5 or 6 games aswell. No way the tale of the tape should be a loss with no goals scored but unfortunantely as per the case for the last 5 years, can't hit a fucking barn door.",Ugh,"Being the manager after TT was always going to be a big task. However, with Potter, like many others, I don't think he's good enough for Chelsea. 

Players need to settle in, of course, but it's not good enough. I have some empathy as it's a tough task as all the money that has been spent increases the expectations. I know press conferences aren't everything, but I don't see enough hunger from Potter. We should still be aiming for the top 4 and a deep run in CL.

Side note when it comes to the money spent. I don't think you can expect us to win every game, which, of course, rival clubs will love to banter. A lot of the players are young, and you're paying for quality and potential. Also, people need to realise the price of players is completely different to even 5 years ago, and people seem to have not adjusted.

We've seen Antony,Pepe,etc. so many players I could rattle off who haven't succeeded. Antony tbf is 22, but the point stands. It's a different era.

Mendy with the ball at his feet looks nervous and it affects the team as a whole. Koulibaly is still adapting. Can't blame the defense much with Reece n Fofana out. The boys look fatigued af. Our midfield needs an overhaul without Jorginho we can't control the game with him he is a bit liability in the defese. We need a player who is a mixture of Jorginho and Cesc with a bit of kante (idk if there's any player like that. If Zakaria is good start him at CDB. Ziyech and Pulisic should have started today. They made a difference. If Broja is not given any servuce he won't score. Love him or hate Him Havertez brings something to this team. He may not always give his best but his presence does a lot.
GP needs to use this break to assess his team and tactics.","Haven’t been this negative about Chelsea in quite a while.

Potter’s Chelsea record has been great so far but the play on the field has been horrible. Playing Sterling and Pulisic at WB game after game is horrible. Should have never sacked Tuchel.

So many players in the squad need to be moved on and not played nearly as much as they have. RLC is a complete liability in midfield time and time again. Chalobah should not be starting, and his undefeated stat is the most misleading statistic I have ever seen.

Past 2 summer transfer windows look to have been complete flops while spending an insane amount of money.

I don’t see this squad and manager being ready to compete for titles for the near future +.","Shouldn't Potter have substituted Pulisic, Broja, and Chukwuemeka at the same time to save one more sub window in case if a late injury?

Fofana was brilliant on the ball and I though Cucurella was immense tonight. Sterling was short on confidence but he’s a great, great player. Havertz looks better with Felix and Sterling since they both push forward.

I thought it was bizarre that Pulisic came on instead of Mudryk, particularly that we were playing on the break after going ahead.

He makes poor decisions in the final third too. He’s just wasting his physical gifts. 

This team needs to stick with the 4-box/diamond-2 with 4 midfielders (including Mount as a 10) until Reece is back. When we only have the double pivot, teams constantly overrun the midfield.

Don't give me the ""we had players out"" excuse.... every player in our starting XI today would start over southamptons, any day of the week, on paper.   
Cucurella needs to be benched btw, he's been too heated for a couple games now and its affecting his focus and ball play while on the pitch. He needs to be sat the next match for chilly, and maybe be subbed back in at the hour mark or whatever. 

Also, wth is jorginho doing in the last 4 matches? Everytime he loses the ball he proceeds to choreogrpahically drop his head, yell at himself, pick his head up, and then do a slow jog backwards. How is that the level the coach accepts in a starting XI player?   


Where are the consequences for bad play in this team? What are the youngsters in the team for, and bench players? Have we learned nothing from young players are capable of from lampard's first season? Isn't tuchel supposedly someone who played youngsters at Dortmund? What's changed now?

You rehab knees in straight motions and that looked a funky flip for a guy with a knee,"We have a completely disjointed team in terms of personnel. Our defense is out injured and we have a non-existent midfield. I think the reason why Kova isn't playing is because of his knee injury, the manager himself said that he has been nursing it for a while and might eventually require a surgery. Tbh I have seen his performance drop a bit atleast in terms of his dribbling ability since his injury. That leaves us with J5 and Zakaria (the latter hasn't played a minute of PL football) who are the only natural central midfielders. Mount and RLC are b2b midfielders and don't have that discipline and passing ability under pressure (RLC has just been bad in every position tbh). All of our forwards don't have a defined role, they are being played all over the pitch especially sterling. Basically all this is to say that the team has no identity at all.

It was a very good game until Reece got injured and then we lost a lot with him coming off. Need a quality RB to come in and help relieve RJ. It’s insane how different it we played as soon as he came off the field. RJ is everywhere, making tackles in midfield, moving the ball up, making great crosses and tackles everywhere. I’m afraid that style of play has made him rather injury prone and if we have no quality back up (bless Azpi’s old soul) we will struggle more often than not.

Still a lot of positive to take from this game and think we looked much better than recent games","God I thought the match was bad, but you lot are a 100x worse.",6 weeks now until we have to watch Chelsea again🎉,"Notes: 

- First half, Too much man marking, with Cucu drifting too much to the Center leaving the right side in the back constantly exposed.
- 3 at the back against a team that comes up high with strong wingers is the mother of bad ideas. 

- A double pivot was unnecessary. They’re not driving through the middle. They play through the flanks, where we were left exposed. We needed to play less compact on the midfield and just played 4 atb.

- Our attacking was good to a certain extent. We did play through the middle and often found our way into their box but 

- Sterling and Havertz aren’t decisive and explosive enough. They’re always a touch or moment too late in either shooting or making a critical asset. I believe a clinical striker would make all the difference there.

- We conceded two own goals. Had Gallagher and Pulisic converted that 100% chance, it could’ve turned different. Their goalkeeper was fantastic and the save on Gallagher’s header was elite. 

- We created enough chances in the first half to convert and had we not conceded two own goals, we actually could’ve easily won.

- Silva is a human being, I blame nothing on him. He’s allowed to make some mistakes once ever blue moon. 

- Cucurella is a liability.  He’s not a left center back and Potter must accept that fact. Either play him as a wingback or don’t play him at all. 

- Brighton players have insane chemistry. They find each other easily and are able to distribute the ball very effectively with just a few touches. We have been better at distributing as well since Tuchel left, but we can not allow the opponent so much space. It’s embarrassing. 

- It made no sense to play Pulisic on right wing. I don’t understand this obsession to play him out of position.

- So then second half came, and we made the critical changes. 4-3-3, Cucu left wingback, Ruben right wingback, Pulisic on left wing (unfortunately temporarily until Auba came on), team playing wider, less man marking, and Brighton’s attack overal was neutralised and they weren’t able to distribute as easily anymore. Problem solved, except for us being clinical. Yes, at times we did still appear wobbly at the back and made some mistakes. That’s a mentality problem if you ask me. 

- Kova as a DM works, the mistake he made that led to the 4th Brighton goal was bad, but overall he did provide good support in the back.

- Gallagher deserved a goal. He played great. Ruben however, he’s not a starter. He’s a decent backup, but that’s about it. So many mistakes, I couldn’t count them. I prefer Azpi as right back while James is recovering. 

- Goal from Havertz was ironically one Sanchez could’ve easily saved. But other than that goal, Havertz is just wasteful. I’m tired of seeing him play. He’s just a bad fit for Chelsea. And why start him when you have Broja?

- Mount is talented and he played good. Made a few minor mistakes but that’s okay. Thing is, he won’t thrive within this team with a lot of mediocre players, especially up front.

- Really good sub from Ziyech; dude was everywhere. Him and Broja should’ve come on much earlier. I’d love to see them start the next match.

- Alas, we conceded the 4th goal. Was it Mendy’s fault? To some extent as he could’ve just catch the ball on their first attempt instead of letting it bounce against his hands. He did make a good save after but their 3th attempt was just too difficult to save. But if it weren’t for Kova passing it so sloppy, they wouldn’t have been able to make an attempt at all.

- Overall, a bad loss yes and we didn’t play nearly as good as we should. Brighton played ball and we didn’t convert enough. A well deserved win for them and a well deserved wake-up call for Potter and the players.",Too bad Pulisic and Broja didn’t start,I was wrong about Kepa club ✊🏽,"it's good we're out so there's less games for these bozos to lose but that was still abysmal.

why does my manager drop Jorgi after a MOTM performance?  
  
why does my manager insist on playing back 3 when most of our defence is injured?

Potter keeps getting these starting formations wrong.","I think the issue was team selection.
Too many players who'd never played together, lack of experience at this level.

Throw in Auba, Sterling, or Pulisic into the mix up front and it could be different.

Overall we didn't deserve 3 points.","Hall, cucurella, and ziyech were all quite good. zakaria felt like he did not do enough. Kova was not at his best but it was not a bad performance. worse score than performance. but we move on. rather this than what we had last game. ruben only turned up second half. needs to be more assertive on the game",I thought Zakaria did well with his positioning actually.

The first goal was deserved by masons hard work but the second goal was just very poor goalkeeping. Villa also missed so many good chances and kepa was a wall. Not a great performance but will take it,Get in!!! We needed that. Good to see some resilience from the boys. Enjoy your Saturday evenings everybody,Guys.... am i being gaslighted by Tuchel..... i keep thinking... would Auba have scored Havertz's chance...... cant stop thinking about it .. fuck,Midfield injuries have always cost us but honestly if Tuchel needs superstars in every position to win games then we should be looking for a new manager. It’s inexcusable how poor some of our players look individually because they simply don’t get enough time in game to get a rhythm. Yes great coaches have to be great tacticians but they also need to be great man managers. Tuchel has not been a good man manager and now we have half of our squad unsettled. Ridiculous substitutions today as well.
96,Potter Out. Where the F is the improvement? This guy is out of his depth. He is not the right man for the job and no amount of awaiting for FURTHER losses will validate staying with him. Absolutely ridiculous. This is not Bad Luck. This is a coach that is not able to take them to the next stage. How can you still defend him. He’s had time. He’s had a break with the players. It’s not working. My god this is unbelievable.,It's almost as if a team with this many new additions and injuries may take some time to get comfortable with one another?

I can accept poor results, the squad clearly isn’t good enough. But that said, he has introduced nothing visible to the club.

There’s no clear pattern of play, no style and he clearly isn’t a motivator who can at least get the lads up for a game. All this talk about a save our season meeting with the senior players and we look a nervy mess right out of the gate barring a couple bright Felix moments.

That’s it, that’s the comment.",[removed]
97,It's good time to bring Tuchel back. Just so he can win Champions League for us once again.,"KK has been immense for about 4 straight games, absolutely class performances.    
  
Chelsea didn’t build off of the last performance against Dortmund, hope they build off of this one. Building some confidence down the stretch here would be huge.",Fofana’s swagger and confidence is quite fun.,Fucking shit club. Joke joke joke. Potter OUT,Unlucky tonight but that was a massive jump in performance for us,"I'm not even mad about the result but damn it feels like we're getting worse every match day.  
Like I've lost any interest in watching the games at this point. Boring at best.",This was such a frustrating game to watch. I missed the first 10 minutes of it but it really didn’t inspire too much in me. People are annoyed and Potter and I understand why. However I feel like we’ve had this same problem forever which is that our midfield is unable to really get the ball to the offense fast enough on counter attacks. And we just end up passing the ball back which gives the opposition enough time to get everyone behind the ball. Couple that with the inability to kill off a game or stay strong enough to not concede and you get the same result that has been going on for years. This isn’t to say Potter isn’t at fault but we have to take some time to recognize that this has been a problem going all the way back to Sarri. We were scoring more under Lampard but the defense wasn’t there. We also keep looking at Tuchel with rose tinted glasses because this was exactly how the season would end as we limped our way to top four. We can buy all the forwards we want but midfield wins you games in the EPL and losing Kovacic and Kante just doesn’t help. I don’t understand where it’s gone wrong because Potter came in and got us winning games when it looked like we were out of the UCL. The worry becomes that Kante/Kovacic stay injured or out of form and the midfield just doesn’t click. If we had a progressive midfield we would be way more dangerous because we need to get Mudryk and Madueke into the game much more as they’re very dangerous. The one time Cucurella ventured forward and actually had a good run was off Mudryk’s first time pass. Another thing to say is that Felix on the left isn’t as dangerous as him having that free roam ability as a 10. I’d rather Mount go LW and Felix keep that role,"Massive indictment on the squad that the 2 best attackers we have had barely trained with the squad but are head and shoulders above the rest. As for Silva, no words can describe him, get him a statue. Badiashile like a vending machine - in a good way - just massive and there when you need him.",POTTER OUT! CLUELESS AND SPINELESS!! MOUNT AND HAVERTZ NEED TO LEAVE,"""But guys, we had a few bad results under Tuchel at the start of this season, so this obviously means the entire squad is now terrible.""

So many deluded excuses around here. Our players can't even do the basics now. It's no fucking coincidence that they're all out of form. It's obviously coming from those above them.","We were so shit in that second half. Azpi needs to be out of the team, he's been a good player for us but he just doesn't cut it anymore, Kuli was shocking and doesn't deserve to wear the no 26, Auba missing the easiest chance of the game, Jorgi invisible all game, Havertz doing fuck all after a decent performance against Brentford. Connor Gallagher has been so over hyped by us as well, he came on and was so shit.   


Ziyech not starting is criminal considering how effective he was and that lands solely at Potters feet, after his WC he should have been in the side. I'm not normally a hater on here but that was shit, was REALLY hoping we'd come back stronger after the WC but nah, back to the same as before, we have no chance of Top 4, I just pray this doesn't stop someone like Fernandez joining!  


Happy new year Chelsea fans!","Zakaria was fucking fantastic, he needs to start every game with Kova. Carney needs to start too.",The referee kept them in the game and gave them believe.,"80% of these players just arent good enough, no manager or tactics can or will help

Just blow this team up and start again","Only caught a part of the 2nd half on my break but our lack of a clinical ball to players in space is so apparent.

So many players on the shoulder of the last defender begging for a ball that will never come.",Re-adjust your expectations for Chelsea. The new owners are going to run the club into the ground. Mid table is our new normal people.,did pulisic fuck potter's wife? baffles me why he got subbed on so late when our attack was putting up a stinker,"It's the same as it's always been. Attacking players standing in place, expecting a ball to feet by threading a needle between three defenders. It's nothing to do with the managers, or 'attacking patterns' (good grief that's a tired cliche) and everything to do with workrate.  Timo worked hard off the ball but unfortunately could do nowt with it once in possession. Our current crop of attacking players, outside maybe Broja, are statues. 

We could play Brentford a hundred times and not score from open play. It's not the tactics, or the formation, it's the players as I'm pretty sure the last three managers haven't told them, *""Now, when you get out there son, I want you to pick a spot and stand there waiting for the ball. Wave your arms around a bit so it looks like the pass is on, alright?""*",Fire Canada,Starting to worry a bit about the reliability of both to be honest. Hopefully this is just bad luck and we'll see a full season out of them going forward. Most important asset is availability.,"Honestly, I am not too worried about Chelsea because there is too much quality in a team with a fantastic coach and staff. I read in a BBC article that “Koulibaly and Fofana are yet to form a cohesive relationship after costing 100m”. Well NO SHIT they’ve only played 2 games together and Fofana hasn’t even been at the club for a week. I’m staying positive, however Ziyech is miles off it. Onwards and upwards.","Can we talk about how poor the referee was?? I slept on it thinking a clear head would think differently, but even now, I get agitated remembering the refereeing yesterday..","Big 3 pts. Palace were the better team tbh. 

Still lots of work to do obviously. No real clear attacking pattern today. Will take time. 

Central midfield was the big weak area for me. Jorginho and Kovacic were not strong and sharp enough to control the flow of the game and Mount had decent involvement and work rate but was shanking everything today. 

Happy for Gallagher, he needed a confidence boost. Class finishing from him and Aubameyang.",Carney will be starting for us in a year,"If it wasn’t for one Silva clumsy slip, this sub would be happy about that game. Sucks we only got a point but I liked how we looked.",It’s been so long since we won a game comfortably,"It's funny, he's crap all the time whenever given a proper challenge and people always just say ""oh it was just a rough game"" or ""it wasn't his fault"". Then they go back to just looking at stats and pretending he's a world beater that we shouldn't have sold",,Disgraceful,"We did not deserve to put 2 in the back of the net. We are conceding a lot of soft goals from set pieces.

Fofana looked good. Chillwell adds something more with his inverted runs. Broja with Havertz feeding off him should start next match.",Waiting for half time to make obvious substitution on a game like today will bite Potter one day. Glad it was not so today.,"Silva was fucking monstrous today. Good for Sterling to get off the mark, ass clenching last 20 minutes but a good win with ten men",Fuck Anthony Taylor,"Well, for anyone who knows how Chelsea team work when you see our good-looking academic fellas Mount, Conor, and RLC all starts, you know it is like a dream coming true. Oh wait, it is dream vs truth time. They were over praised for teammates merits. You can have one or two such players on pitch but not three along the center line. It’s not their fault though, fans made them sound indispensable, especially Mount.

Reece is in another category. He has a top-team starting quality, although still over-shielded from critics and over-praised."

Let's hope that gives the boys a boost to start building some momentum","Potter has made it super hard to defend him now. Pissed off that the players that have been bums even during TT era are going to most likely remain over Potter.

But Potter needs a slap, this is a sackable defeat.",Natural improvement that happens when you have RJ & Chillwell in the team. Still lots of issues throughout the team,We looked like a bunch of random guys chasing a ball.,Can someone please explain why we are not starting Chilwell… side show bob is just absolutely useless,"Honestly it's criminal how long it takes Mount and Gallagher to make a decision.  

Even Ziyech, who was our best attacking player. Though he managed to get most of his passes off before he was closed down.

I'm happy with Mudryk's first showing.

Let's not bring Aubameyang on now because I can't remember him doing anything except shielding the ball and being pulled over",Everyone should stop calling for Potter to be sacked. He needs to be given time.,"Pathetic and spineless. Players hardly trying, not a single time after going down did we increase the urgency or quality. 

Aside from the players being awful, there seemed to be no idea or game plan. When the defenders had the ball there was absolutely no movement, and then if it somehow found a forward they were isolated or simply lost the ball. I know we have injuries but it’s truly shocking how bad we are right now. We had two shots and both were deflected and half chances at best","Havertz Mount doesn't work. People are living off of their high with their champions league win years ago. That's 1 point out of seven league games for you. That combination of players was used in nearly all of those games.

Havertz Mount frontline is mediocre at best, they create absolutely nothing.","Zakaria was fucking fantastic, he needs to start every game with Kova. Carney needs to start too.",The injury to RJ rendered this win almost meaningless for me 😭,Nkunku is throwing that paperwork in the shredder as we speak lmfao,seriously what did we expect?,"Damn Top 4 looks impossible now

Feel like we are the United of Last season",I am so fucking tired of us constantly failing against a fucking shit United. So much of our team is absolutely bang average,"I'm seeing lots of reactionary takes - Frankly, this was a tough game and Brentford gave everything they had.

No, the refs didn't cost us points - I think both the Mee tackle and the handball would have been harsh to be on the receiving end. Brentford were tireless and extremely disciplined when forced to stay compact in their low-block. Any time there was even a hint of an opening, they were determined to recover and put their bodies on the line.

From our side, some players were really bright. 

**Kepa** continued his run of confidence and stayed composed both on ball and stopping shots. 

**Chalobah** showed top notch determination to act as sweeper against the talented duo of Toney & Mbuemo. He wasn't the progressive passing threat in the CCB role that our Brazilian leader is, but he wasn't a negative either, often playing quick 1or2 touches in circulation.

**Kovacic** entering the field completely improved our ability to connect build up to attack and offered great instincts to snuff out counters via tackles and interceptions. He even threatened goal from distance a couple times at the end, which is uncharacteristic, but extremely welcomed. Hope **Gallagher** is okay, but he looked very poor in this appearance.

**Broja** was a menace from a physical standpoint against the Brentford backline. Still needs to work on getting his head up, but he was operating with a **Havertz**\-shaped crutch who was crowding spaces whilst not really offering combination play. I've been saying it since his Soton days, but his close down awareness, timing, and angles are highly impressive and we saw glimpses of that today. I would have liked him to rip some shots to test Raya, but he hesitated a couple times; the Albanian should have played the full 90 as he was our most dangerous player during his time on the pitch.

**Pulisic** had an electric cameo during a time that we were devoid of creativity. He was fantastic operating in little pockets of space, and turning his man. Had some nice runs and shots, but ultimately felt like he was getting no support from the rest of the attacking players. 

I think **Potter** ultimately got the tactics wrong to start off, but made some changes to help stabilize the midfield. What was the point of wingbacks if they weren't stretching the field vertically or providing quality service? I realize he probably is still playing catchup to understanding the roster's strengths and weaknesses, and playing pragmatically isn't the worst idea to start your tenure, especially when we have some big games coming up. I've been a fan of his rotation so far, including this game, and just hope he's realizing who is versatile vs who is mercurial with certain variables.",Atleast Potter knows who he doesn’t have to start against newcastle,"Same thing happened last season, they both got injured and everything went to hell. Fucking distraught.",We are one month into the season and I am already looking forward to the start of a new one just painful to watch,"Motm Chalobah, Sterling and Mount. Thankfully Pulisic got subbed off. If not he would have allowed another goal.","Win is a win I guess. Happy for Gallagher, hopefully settles him down a bit.",Everybody clowned me for saying play Gallagher out wide almost as a winger. But he looks very good.,"Auba made us look a man down. 

Can’t believe Broja isn’t starting games he does more in his cameo than Auba and Havertz combined. 

We need to start using our only DM. 

Zyiech… IF I SPEAK.",Good win for us! Hope this boosts our morale and confidence!,"2007/08 / Fire coach, reach Champions league final, losing only on penalties",,When are we going to question Tuchel?,"Every week I just wish for a game where we play well and are comfortably 2-0 up by half time. It's not that much to ask...

Today our midfield was dire. Kova could not influence the game. Gallagher was running around doing nothing. RLC played deepest which means yet again he is hesitant in going forward because of defensive responsibilities. As much as I think Jorginho is a defensive liability, he is still necessary at the base of our midfield when we play midfield 3. With the way he controls the midfield, he frees the 3rd midfielder to attack. RLC has no such control.

I don't understand why we keep playing with false nines AND 3atb. We lack personnel up front in this set up. It's no surprise we looked so dire until Broja came on.",Taking kova off as well.

Great work ethic throughout the game. I thought Jorgi struggled simply because Palace were powerful through midfield, RLC came on and it stabilised things. Chilwell was quite negative going forward often opting for the backwards pass, but it’s hopefully he gets more confidence. Couldn’t fault the work rate of any of the players though.

And I’m gonna say it, but Reece James is the best right back in the world. I thought he was absolutely outstanding today. Controlling the overhead lob and beating his man all in one movement was sublime!","This match was so refreshing. Wolves were horrible and new manager bounce is a thing, but to change the lineup and still play so fluidly is great to see.","Azpi is done at this club.

Good to see Sterling bag a couple of goals, should help his confidence. Great performance in the second half from Kai. Lots of people hating on him in the match thread but I'd ask them to play as an isolated lone striker against a Premier League side when you're down to 10. Held the ball up well, provided a solid outlet when we needed it, and some solid shithousing right at the end. Not the best we'll ever play but certainly good enough today.",Anyone who doesn’t think FD Jong is an upgrade on Jorginho is mad.

But how can you play Azpi, Silva and KK in same backline? It will just set them up for faliure and it won't be their fault.

Look at arsenal rebuild, Real's rebuild, going for young, hungry, energetic players that are good. While we are looking to pay 30m for another older player that had already declined in PL and wasn't looking good. Buying 30 plus isn't a rebuild, where the fuck are our scouts? Can't we find a young striker for 30m that will be good at least for one season and will have a decent resale value 8f we need to move him in future if he doesn't pan out or we need other striker? And who if turns out good will make us have a good young player for some time.

Kovacic and Jorginho can't play together because they are both ""attack minded"" meaning that they are best in possession rather than defending. 



Out of possession, Kovacic and Jorginho in a midfield 2 are not good enough defensively and that's enough of a reason to not play them together especially when playing a back 4.

Havertz is being played out of position for the sake of Mount but last season and the beginning of this one he hasn't done enough. At least Havertz can head the ball to get us out of pressure and can hold up play. Today Mount had a 1 on 1 with a defender after Havertz headed him into space and he didn't score. It's understandable but you expect some of these shots to go in every now and then. He also had a shooting opportunity with his left foot inside the box in the 2nd half and didn't even shoot.

Also Gallagher was solid. He was asked to replace the best CDM in the world and did his best. Created a great opportunity in the 1st minute that should've been a goal

Hopefully we can play like this in the 2nd leg, should we do that we should win and make it to the next round",I blame myself for reading PM thread after we drew or loss. The negativity can drive people insane.,Least likable manager we've had in a long long time. Cannot wait to see the back of him.,I see glimpses of how we are going to be playing in a year or two in this game. Very pleased with the new signings baring some bad luck. Mudryk's time on the pitch has me bricked up right now but this game clearly shows us we need a midfield signing desperately. Our midfielders weren't cutting it besides Jorginho (still not a huge fan of him),"Wake me up when Potter is sacked. I will be sleeping till then. How can we even compete for 10th with this mentality?

We should have buried the game long before red card. This kind of attitude I have seen only with Scolari and AVB. Pathetic","That ESPN commentary is dogshit. Not a mention of the Chelsea injuries, kids being played, and a completely untested 11.",I wonder at what point Boehly and Clearlake are going to realize that re-couping their investment is going to be a lot harder than they planned. The league has 7 CL contenders now and we're nowhere near the top in terms of quality.,Facts are the squad is a mess partially due to injuries and partially due to years of terrible signings. Only way forward is a full squad rebuild with the manager being backed not the players.,"Interestingly I thought havertz had a frustrating game today with many instances a bad touch or bad decision slowed or stopped our play(e.g. turnover), so surprised by the reception he's getting. Just wish he tightened up that part of the game cos he's just so dynamic and interplays better with the other attackers than other striking options fair. Very positive and hope he improves more!","With the exception of Reece, there isn't a single player in the squad that I would bat an eyelid over if they were sold tomorrow.",I'm tired Robbie.,"Sterling is a finished player. Average squad player .he isn’t gonna do anything special or finish crucial chances. 

Same goes for havertz and auba. All are unable to take shots. Ziyech can do something. Should try him next.",Is it a fucking rule or something that United have to sign fucking little snide rats,"Toothless performance, havertz once again doing his best to convince everyone he isn’t a top level player.","Play football all their life, forget the one job while inside the penalty box. 😭😭😭😭","That's just the expected outrage from the Potter haters and fans who are more invested in players than the club. Anyone blaming management for playing a fit player desperate to increase his level is just dumb as fuck. Yes, its unfortunate but   honestly if that's the reason to turn on the manager than gtfo. Can't believe the shit I'm reading here. We're fucking Chelsea and it's literally the pinnacle of European football why would we roll out our U23 for charity?",This is our lowest point since 15/16. Absolutely gutless shambolic performance. 2 shots in the first 75 minutes.,Reminds me of our more old school shit housery we've done in the past.,"Connor you beauty Gallagher

Need to start getting a run of wins now boys. We can do this!!! Bring on AC Milan. Reece bullied Zaha that he had to swap wings haha gotta love it",Tears in my eyes another clean sheet too. 😢,HOW THE FLYING FUCK DO WE NOT WIN THAT GAME?!?!?!?,Potterball 🔥🔥🔥,if we play like this till the end we surely can. its a big if tho,,"I don’t remember feeling this “meh” so quickly, only 5 games in",I’ll take the 3 points but still such a poor performance. Our attacking play really really needs to improve and it’s worrying seeing the complete lack of creativity. Hopefully this performance from chilwell brings him back to last seasons levels,"Could have been 2-1 or 3-1 to Villa before halftime if it wasn’t for this man. On the one hand, we shouldn’t get carried away with the manner in which we won. On the other hand, we have every right to celebrate how immense Kepa was for us today. Got us at least 2 points.","We really need to stop shooting our selves in the foot when we play. It’s like we purposely handicap ourselves. 

Glad we won! I must admit I didn’t think we would do when Gallagher got sent off so early. I would’ve taken a point then.

107,Well if we get knocked out of CL this week at least I won’t have to care about anything else this season.,[deleted],still 3/10 rating for potter for those subs wtf was that. subbing best players off while havertz gets another 90min. he got away with it imo. and we still cant score from open play.,"15m compensation for Tuchel

5 yr 60m contract for Potter

WORST DEAL OAT",Let's have Kai sit a couple games and play a out & out ST or let's just start shooting from anything under 30 yards.,0 goals again man Tuchel cant coach an attack,I would’ve loved to have seen what tuchel could do with this kind of backing.,"Shiiiiit, my ass donated to  a Ukrainian charity after that performance from Mudyrk","Potter is very likable. I still have faith in him based on the current injuries we have alone. 

Tuchel was great and won the CL but his end days our attack and midfield was just as lethargic as we are now. 

I wish we could hit the reset button and let Potter have a full season but he has to figure things out. I wouldn’t mind giving him time but we are atrocious currently.","I really hope the new owners are not as impatient as the fans here in r/chelseafc. Were rebuilding from inside out, owner, manager, personnel, players and it takes fucking time",Commentary said no team has had this few points at this stage of the season and finished top 4. So that’s where we are.,"Our midfield and defend played really well today but our attack is so poorly compare to Salah Rashford Mahrez Saka Son, We need winger who play like prime Hazard Pedro  Willian and striker like Costa or Drogba.","Should've been more, i'm more than happy with our passing and attacking, that clinical finishing from Havertz and Mount, i hope we'll see more like this.","I'll say it here again. Bohley and co. Pay more attention on getting this team back on track instead some all stars game, you bunch of clowns. The only good thing this club had bar two or three players was the coach and you sacked him.","Chelsea need to get back to playing more positive football.  We've gone so pragmatic since Lampard left and it's awful to watch.

Would rather see the team go out on their shield playing like they think they can win than the negative slow death football we've seen so often under Tuchel sometimes and now Potter in seemingly every big game.",Cucurella should never start a game for Chelsea again. He brings absolutely nothing to the team.,Kova is packing,"Havertz has offered absolutely nothing quite a while now, wish Auba came on much sooner",If we could finish… some positive signs marred by poor finishing and some good saves by the city keeper. On to the weekend. KRBFFH,"Obviously he wasn't ready to play 90 minutes if a non contact injury like this happened.. it happens, but chillwell was still recovering. Results speak for themselves, he shouldn't have been playing the whole game",100 games Tuchel has been in charge for. He still has absolutely no idea what system to play or what players to put on the pitch.,And again not letting the keeper kick the ball forward. Standing in front of him,"Potter has barely been with the team a month, give him time to actually get the players to execute his vision.  Playing with 4 atb and getting a win against any PL side is a huge achievement.",Very solid performance all around today,"Anyone who thinks Ziyech is still worthy of a Chelsea shirt, have a quiet word with yourself. The man is fucking tool","Leao is a beast, we need that on the left wing…",I'd put Kova up there with Mount and Jorgi.,,"Hold off on the contract extensions please, at least until January",Is this how it feels to be Spurs fan when they met us?,Mason hitting form as James gets injured is actually really good for us. Today could have been quite a bit more difficult without James + in form Mason.,"Amazing result considering we played with 10 men for more than 60mins. I'm glad Sterling finally scored and i hope Tuchel saw that we need and actual winger instead of playing Mount there. We looked way better with Havertz, Sterling and Cucurella attacking",[removed],"I thought losing my job would be the worst thing that happened to me today, I also work across from a sports bar in Leeds so got to watch all their fans have a really really great time."
108,When’s it gonna end Robbie!,I love. Havertz,[deleted],In talksport interview Potter has basically said we had to make changes because of the champions League and that Southampton were a well prepared team.. The same Southampton that currently are without a manager btw,What a frustrating game to watch. Created loads of chances but no one can put the ball in the back of the net. Same old story....,"Im wondering how far fans can support mount. Honestly he is washed. The blackest hole in our squad yesterday and made no effort to integrate with new players.

Hates to pass to them and would simply hog the ball or pass to his mates who he is close to.

Starting mount is close to criminal by potter and if this carry on, nothing will change","I know nobody is talking about it for obvious reasons, but needs to be said that Gallagher looked dreadful in his 15 minutes. Trying to save a ball that was already going out for a Chelsea throw, actively getting in the way of passes not meant for him, and dribbling around aimlessly instead of progressing. For me this was one of the worst outings I’ve seen from him would’ve much rather had Carney come in and give it a try for RLC.","I’ll stick to the positive as half our starters are injured. 

Badiashile - growing in confidence looks good next to Silva..looking forward to his development 

Silva- not much to say ..getting better with age

Who could have possibly seen this coming?",Hopefully Boehly gets on his knees and begs Tuchel to come back.,Roman would have sacked Potter for this form lol. I’m writing this season off I will back and give time but this is gunna be a rough end of the season.

Today looked better, but our finishing has looked woeful for years now",At this point am mentally numb to these injuries.. I just hope Potter figures out a way to win without Reece or fofana..,"New manager bounce has worn off and the players are looking like they have no fucking clue what they’re meant to be doing on the pitch. Right now Potter is looking like he’s not ready to manage at this level and I’ll be astonished if we make top 4 this season.

Hope I’m wrong",We absolutely need to get rid of the 3 ATB nonsense.,"Look at Spurs lol, real comeback with a real serial winning manager that has the CV worthy of managing a top 6 side",Lousy performance imo,What an incredibly frustrating game of football really no idea how havertz managed 80 mins of football that was a Ziyech esque disaster class. Great to see Pulisic look like the old him had a bit of swagger about him which was good Carney played well too. Havertz has to be dropped from now on there’s no way he can continue just doesn’t offer anything.,I'm not going to lie. We had our shots. But that Ortega was on fire.,"I’m confused, the got same GD and head 2 head, is it alphabetical?",I hope Ziyech never kicks a ball for Chelsea again. Braindead.,Broja is massive,"The amount of times I found myself screaming “SHOOOOOOT!” at my TV.. Ffs man.

Massive 3 points and I would like to see both Conor and Broja start ahead of Mount and Havertz who have been very, very poor..","Looks like Potter is quickly figuring out the winning combination. I was skeptical on the amount of change we made (although got a mid week away game) but oh boy, I was wrong",Chelsea is just like me playing Fifa. Takes all match to score and when it happens the defense fucks up once and it's done.,So did Fofana tear is ACL or what?,"Against Salzburg specifically yeah.

Winning against Zagreb is enough for us to qualify.",,"There needs to be serious pressure on Tuchel going forward. I’m not on the Tuchel out train quite yet but these results are laughable. I seriously question his personal choices and the team plays with no energy. It’s a bore to watch.

Kai needs time on the bench. But we knew that already and he somehow keeps getting starts. Mount, while not great, I think took a step forward from his previous performances. Sterling had some poor decision making but he at least he can make a half decent attempt at finishing, so it’s a step up from the rest of our attackers. 

As for Pulisic, this sub has so much irrational and unnecessary animosity towards him. The fact that he’s the main focus of hate in this sub after that team wide shitter proves that. Was he poor today? Yeah! but what do you want from him. Never gets a chance at consistent playing time, gets denied his transfer request, and gets played at RWB. Hard to make a difference with no rhythm, out of position, and no midfield support. He’s in the worst possible situation for a winger",I might finally be able to not send a reminder that we win games with Chilwell on the pitch because he will simply be starting from now on. Back to winning I guess.,"Mase was unreal today, that free kick was a thing of beauty. I thought Loftus Cheek played real well. Connor provided a ton of good energy in the 2nd half and in general the team played with much more desire that 2nd half. 

But, the star and man of the match for me today was Kepa, which goes to show how amazing he was considering Mase had 2 goals. Kepa kept us in the lead for a long stretch of time with one unbelievable save after another. That diving save from the cross was truly phenomenal stuff. Another clean sheet for the lads thanks to this man!",So happy to see Kovacic back. Looks like he's hardly missed a beat too. Can't wait to see him at his best soon,Individual and refereeing mistakes costing us yet again,Koulibaly came here for a paycheck
109,I know the last few days under Tuchel were poor. But we’ve gotten worse. Far far worse.,Idc if Felix is gonna be expensive buy him PLEASE he gives us such a spark in attack. He also lets Kai play deeper on the pitch and Kai plays so well when he can float deeper like he did today,Obviously happy for the win but my goodness that was dreadful. A cagey 1-0 win off a corner against a genuine relegation candidate just is not good enough for Chelsea.,"Problem is he needs to go now, bring in a new manager who can get some time in with the team to have the off-season to enter the transfer market with a good idea of who needs to go/come in. Absolutely no honor in sitting back and watching it get worse.","They're playing better, building up a fast attack and taking shots so now it's up to Potter to get them to play well as a team.","Same with tuchel and same with Potter. Why they both keep playing Mount and kai? I don't understand a lot of excuses like, ""oh, fofana is young and inexperienced"". Or ""we play kai cause of his height and for headers"". Like do they have something in their contracts that binds both the managers to keep them playing? I mean cucurella hasn't impressed so far and he's an average signing for us. Our new guy MM got sick? Then why the fuck did he start the match? Why are you playing a guy who's sick? If ut weren't dor thiago and badi we would not have kept a clean sheet. 

Enzo will leave soon if this continues. He's not going to gamble. In his debut match he looked kinda puzzled at time on what our other players are doing.  He was disappointed by our players. 

William was still a better player than more than half of our team. I mean the guy dribbled and still has the pace, created chances and would have scored 2 easy chances had he been a little selfish. Noni, Enzo, DDF, felix looked more connected to the team than some of our players who have been playing here since the middle ages.","No improvement at all. Every week is the same, shit tactics, shit subs, shit manager. Potter out.","Excited for Felix to come back, definitely will be taking Mounts spot.",Fuck the piece of shit Boehly. Fuck Potter. Fuck Boehlybots.,Thanks Putin.,Ziyech needs to start. He’s in form and full of confidence.,"Eyyo where was this 'Haaland"" person everyone been talkin bout?","Really great game from mount today. Was all over the field, creating, combining with everyone on the pitch and doing really good defensive work. Pulisic similarly worked hard and had a good game. Kai had a great game! Could go on and on tbh, the entire team played well and dominated the game. Most excited about how creative we were though, Reece and sterling huge parts of that too. Best game in a long time. Build on it.","During the first half I was asking myself what Havertz does better than Pulisic. I came up with shots from distance, headers, and defending corners (given his height). Then in the second half Havertz gives up a goal on a corner by completely whiffing on a ball kicked right at him. Absolutely comical.

Pulisic is the most potent attacker we have right now, and it's not particularly close. Playing Havertz, Sterling, or Gallagher more minutes than him is completely indefensible. The biggest impact a coach can have is player selection, and Potter is getting that wrong. I'm sure Potter has his reasons. They may even be sound reasons. But the end result on the pitch is complete garbage.",Worldcup couldn’t come fast enough. We are in shambles.,POTTER IS TOO SMALL FOR CHELSEA,This fixture is fucking cursed.,Puli needs to start… Kai is dreadful out there. Shows 0 effort or heart. Terrible body language. Puli creates so much for the squad. He was terrific today.,"Wembley curse finally lifted. Let's goooooooooooooooooooooo.

Or not. Whatever.","?

Chilwell was absolutely shite.  I get being sympathetic because of his injury but he was really poor for the 90 today",Tuchel is an absolutely lucky goal from Chillwell and a horrible VAR overturn from only getting points from relegation Lester. He’s should be gone immediately,Broja reminds me a bit of Giroud/Costa,"So happy for Gallagher, and very classy non-celebration after the goal. We still could have played better overall but what a way to finish.",That was delightful,"Sisappointinf result from a bad defensive decision by Silva and a terrible shot attempt by Ziyech. But anyone who thinks this performance looks remotely similar to our last 10 games is talking shit through tinted glasses. Much better energy, much better attacking presence, especially in the first half. Hell we played an over the top ball or two to a runner!",We are massive,Yes,,Mount had a good cameo for 23 minutes. Needs to be dropped to lit fire under him. Also he needs to work on his positioning when on attack.,Their 2nd goal should have stood but don't forget their 1st goal came from someone who had nothing to do on the pitch. It evens out.,"I didn't see the whole game, but I have a hard time believing he was better than against Frankfurt... He was something else in those games",how come we played much better with 10 men,"Fuck Anthony Taylor, we played great. Taking absolutely nothing but positives from this game (start Broja next week)","I'm so over signing players for big money just because of their ""potential"". Get people that have solid performances behind them for a few seasons. We got all the potential we need in the academy."
110,"I've been really patient with Potter. He has genuinely had some extreme challenges with the amount of injuries we had and then having to integrate so many new players into the team. To an extent this has shown a big reason why we havent found any consistency or improvement as we've averaged like 4 changes every game. 

However, the quality of our performances shows no signs of improving atm. The amount of goals scored is pitiful. He seems to lack the ability to change games tactically through substituions like top managers can do such as Tuchel, Conte or Pep. 

I think the biggest problem might even be confidence and belief in the squad now, the players are surely struggling to get behind Potter's ideas at this stage. I kind of feel bad because we've been forced to make changes so often we haven't been able to find consistency and now he's probably lost the confidence of the squad, I can't see a way back for him. In other circumstances maybe he could of found his consistent XI and actually do okay.

All that being said, I do think it's past the stage of salvaging. Even with the problems faced, we shouldn't be this bad.",I’m ready for the 5 MOTM awards Kante will get in the UCL this year.,"There is enough quality in that squad to not have to grind out a win against a poor Leeds side, at home.","I am enjoying all the Potter defenders finally realizing he is shit. Something you guys hammered against those calling his ouster 2 months ago. It doesn't take long for some to realize it's bad coaching that is the issue. After you spend enough money to buy out several championship teams with no improvement, then your manager is the issue.","Mhhh I saw a lot I liked, if we continue playing like that we win more than we lose. On the right path!","Havertz/Mount are our Koulibaly of attack

We just need to find our replacements soon",Tuchel the results are the same because the players are the same. Tuchel did the best with that lot.,Progress  at least we are getting pissed at Draws again instead of acceptance of losses as part of the game.,"So the players have problems you can all admit this. We can agree some of them have to go. However, can I ask a question? What has Potter done/said to make you think he is the one to build around? 


Without mentioning Tuchel because he is gone and not coming back",GET POTTER THE FUCK OUT THE CLUB AND GET MR TT BACK! None of us even asked for tuchel to get kicked it was forced upon us by the dipshit new owners who’ve got next to no knowledge about the sport they can’t even call by the correct name. BUNCH OF USELESS ASSHOLES,"Threw away an easy win to FUCKING 19TH PLACE FUCKING FOREST WHO ARE GOING DOWN, LET THAT SINK THE FUCK IN",I hope we give hall more game time to develop and get better. Him and James down the wing we'll be soo dangerous on both sides,"From ESPN “Pulisic struggles but Chelsea beat bournemouth”…… I watched this whole match.  Wtf are they talking about.  It’s so annoying.  He probably should have been given that penalty kick too. He had a few giveaways, but so did just about everyone.  So annoying","What I don't like - 

1. Our luck - Kante, Chilly and Reece injured.  3 world class players who can influence a game so so much .

2. Our formation or lack of it .

3. Our identity - are we playing counter attacking , are we playing possesion ? Are we playing long ball ? Are we playing rough ? 

4. Zakaria had a decent debut , this game demands a dominant midfielder , should've used him
RLC and Mount and Sterling are all out of form , shouldn't have started this game . Okay you can start 1 of them but not all out of form players .

5. Lack of passing options or runners. 

6. Poor substitutions.","Key take away for me…we REALLY struggle against physically stronger sides. 

Every set piece is a danger, initial clearances won only leads to 2nd balls lost. Midfield overran not by speedier or more skilled opposition but by pure bullying. Our attacks stifled by defenders that should realistically be troubled by pace.

Often thought paying over the odds for Rice would be counter-productive, but more and more thinking it might be a necessity.","RLC is shit and is only at Chelsea because he’s good looking, he literally gets a pass because he looks like what you’d imagine a top football looked like 

Swap his face with Harry Maguire and he would have been sold 5 years ago","We are cursed. Hear me, we are cursed in this fixture. I’ll be 90 years old when we finally beat united in the league.",A 6.6 for Pulisic?  No way.  He created well and was a huge spark when he came on,"Of course their keeper turns into Prime Buffon.

But let's not lie to ourselves, our attack is unbelievably bad at passing so forget about finishing. 

We didn't play that bad but as soon as they scored we all knew it's a wrap. It's crazy to feel this powerless and it's been going on for close to a year now.

Onto Newcastle but damn, it's going to be a long, long season.","He had to be helped off the pitch, if you can't even walk on an injured hamstring then I doubt he's going to Qatar

Kova was uncharacteristically not ""press resistant"" 

Jorginho got bullied physically by Doucoure and bypassed by the silky skills of Eze/Olise

For RLC, again he could not do his thing because he was in a pivot whereby he was always shackled with defensive responsibility. That's why he played his usual 4/10 safe style football.

Without a functioning midfield, our offense barely had chances to threaten. Doesn't help that Mount was useless yet again.","How did KK do

Edit: ANSWER ME",We actually looked pretty good offensively. We’ll get there.  I think Fofana or KK should have been starting but other than that we have a lot to look forward to.,"Solid performance by us, and buzzing about the 3pts, but can't help but caveat the evening that Milan were poor. Average first half, and a great start to the second saw the win secured by the 65th minute.

At halftime I commented that Mount and Chilwell were not in sync and constantly taking up each other's spaces/lanes. That all changed in second half where Mount seemed to have more freedom to drop deeper into midfield and even roam to the right channel. Putting him up high against the defensive line really just isn't his game, even if he is taking up a winger type role.

We also showed more urgency to play cross field passes when Milan were overcommitted, which I think has been 1 of our most glaring weaknesses in the last few seasons. The driven cross field ball from Mount to James was incredibly saucy. Just wish we'd do that more consistently.

Speaking of, our man James was a level above everyone yet again. The guy can do it all. He helped keep Leao relatively contained, whilst also providing composure in possession as an outlet, along with creative threat for both himself and others. He's truly the first name on the team sheet, and can fulfill any role Potter will want of him. Doesn't matter against low blocks or high press. Man marking or zonal. Creative outlet in possession or finisher in the box. In space or in congestion. I hope to be singing his praises for a decade+.

Potter clearly still has some work to do on passing combinations and movement patterns, but overall today was a day where players stepped up when called upon. Great win in a vital game.","This fella is not managing CL games again, for a while atleast.

Thats how refs function right? Get bumped down a level when they pull a mad one like today",,"TT is not the answer to this team's problems.

I've always been one to say that the squad is the problem rather than the manager, but you have to face the reality and admit that Tuchel has made every one of our players struggle in his system. There is nobody you can really point to in saying that he's improved.

Frank deserved to be sacked by the end, but at least he could point to a crop of young players that he had turned into fantastic assets to the team. TT inherited that side and has turned them into very mediocre players at best. Reece is probably the only exception to this, but has TT actually improved him? 

If a decent replacement arises he should be moved on. It's going to happen sooner or later anyway...","After drawing a game we should have won (Spurs), I can safely say that it feels much better to win a game that we have no business winning.",Nah we got those points back at West Ham as far as I’m concerned that’s paid for in the balance of the season karma,"Havertz was actually a good outlet up top in the second half siege, though I still believe his best form will come in the midfield.

Thought Ruben and Enzo held up well in the middle throughout,"Feel like this one’s on Potter 

Not sure how fit are they but Sterling or Madueke should’ve started on that right side instead of Ziyech who clearly doesn’t want to be here 

And how the hell Mount played further up than Mudryk in the first half lmao. Felt weird that Mudryk was dropping deeper than Mount helping Cucurella out","I get he’s still young, do you think kai havertz will ever grasp the concept of staying onside? Maybe another 4-5 years and maybe it will click for him? I thought staying onside you mastered by u-14","Felix, Mudryk, Sterling, Ziyech, Pulisic, Mount, Havertz, Madulke, Auba

That being said, I'm not looking forward to the city match. Can't believe a team that cost this much can look so out of sorts, and no, missing RJ or kante isn't a good enough excuse.",I honestly thought city was going to spank us 4-0 or 6-0 like they do on occasion so I wasn't too bummed. We played much better today than we have recently,"Incredible, still 16 points behind Arsenal.

Lucky our first game back was a Bournemouth, if it was anyone better we'd of looked lost.","Absolutely dominated in the midfield. Partey and Xhaka showed us how it's done, play quick 1 touch and get the ball forward. I feel sorry for our attack who has to deal with the pivot.   


The pseudo intellectual Chelsea fans who show non-stop  praise for Jorginho are setting our club back. They're campaigning for a contract extension so we can suffer 3 years more of this. RLC wasn't good so we can point fingers at him but he was subbed off and nothing changed. The 'controller' stayed on the pitch however. This myth needs to be dispelled, he doesn't control tempo or games, has always been a team effort but he gained praise as his name sounded fancy. The constant fuel to justify his 50m price tag and 'regista' title needs to stop. 

&#x200B;

He's apparently a ball playing midfielder, but his on the ball abilities are poor. Very  small passing range, too many touches, lacks vision and creativity too. I can't be sold. He has redeeming attributes but they're all off the ball such as intercepting and breaking up play. 

&#x200B;

It's apparent that this team has always been carried by Kante and now that he's injured we've blown up, it's been like this for years. We need to invest in an actual midfielder who can unlock a defence, and get us up the pitch. Please be smart and go for Tielemans Boehly.  


  
Additionally first half I thought Havertz was poor, and did nothing with the good chances we did engineer. Cucurella kept trying hero balls forwards and they never executed.",Roll on the WC.,"A few matches ago I said that arsenal and city would destroy us with the way we're playing.

After we conceded, had loads of the ball but didnt really create clear chances outside of the one that fell to Kouli.  Lots of shots outside the box or tame shots at the keeper.  Sigh.

Then you shouldn’t be backing Graham Potter unless you’re a hypocrite. 

The person who supposedly “built Brighton” got manhandled 4-1 by them. Couldn’t even identify the weakness of the players and team he supposedly built. 

We needed a goal today he brought on Gallagher and Cucurella instead of strikers.

Villas Boas was a winner before he to Chelsea. Lampard qualified for top 4 and took us to a cup final. Sarri won us a European trophy. All got sacked for less.

It’s okay to admit Potter is out of his depth. Stop being biased towards English managers. He lost more games than he won at Brighton. He is not that guy. We are never too big to get relegated. F*ck this process.

Obviously willing to give Potter time but we just look so dull at the moment.","Apart from Liv & Fulham which we have yet to play, we have not won against any of the team currently above us this season. What an achievement","so far Todd already made numerous bad decisions:

Overpaying for an injury prone Fofana

Overpaying for Cucurella

Paying 35m for a very average and underwhelming Koulibaly with a 4-year contract

Paying 10m for Aubameyang when Arsenal release him for free

Giving a 7 year contract and 350k per week to Reece James who cant stay healthy for more than 2 games in a row.

We looked much better with a back 4 and RLC was decent enough for awhile there. Even made more chances with a ""less offensive"" formation because we could actually control the ball a little better and not get dominated.

And we see how unsettled we are without jorginho yet again.

P.S. We need Gvardiol",broke my fkin chair and earphones. good we are ass. and I need a chair,"Havertz needs to be benched indefinetely, disgusting performance","Our finishing woes continue, but we also just make poor decisions in the final third so often that other teams almost always put the ball in the right spot, we somehow pass way behind or way ahead with that final ball, its just depressing to see it over and over.

I think that final line up had something though, we didn't finish but we looked pretty decent on both sides. If we have James there instead of RLC, that might really work. Its a process and there were some good things to take away here. Hall looked pretty good, unfortunately couldn't bag either of his two good chances but I'd like to see more of him. Pulisic created well, but also gave away and missed his chances. Ziyech also had his moments of quality. Kova needs help in midfield, and none of our current answers are good enough it seems. Finally, I think our back line just isn't in form at the moment and obviously sorely missing Silva and Fofana.

I don't think this one was as bad as the score line suggests, couple things go our way and its a draw or win. We have things to work on, Newcastle is important, but more importantly is how we look post WC.","Potter rotated 7 players from our last match.

West Ham defended super deep but we should be able to create chances against them with the players we have. We got very, very lucky to come away with all three points here. 

Still, a win's a win. If we can somehow use this to build some actual momentum and string some results together we could finally get off and running properly this season. A man can hope.",yeah that does annoy me more than it probably should,"My unqualified take from this game on a player-by-player basis:

Mendy - Shot stopping was very good but can't be that easily beaten at the near post and still struggling with his feet. Will be one who if he doesn't have a big season could be looking at being replaced next year.

James - Always looked comfortable in possession and was his calm and collected self. The team looks to have a lot better balance with him at wing back.

Silva - Excellent as always but beginning to show more signs of age in the way he holds himself. Should be transitioned to more of a backup / irregular started to ensure he is always remaining fit, especially in busy winter periods.

Chalobah - Solid in the air and an overall decent performance, but Vardy should have exploited him poor positioning on more than one occassion. May struggle for game time with Koulibaly and Fofana available.

Cucurella - Very composed on the ball but left Gallagher in no-mans lands with that hospital ball just before the red card. Energy down the left definitely helped win us the game.

Gallagher - Seems to be trying too hard to try to impress. To me he doesn't fit with Jorginho as if Gallagher (as he so often does) runs out of position to press it leaves Jorginho very isolated. Red card was naive and he has to learn from that if he is to be last man from corners.

Jorginho - Helped us maintain good shape and possession in the first half but showed his defensive weakness as Leicster overran us second half. Although I think he is a quality player, I still think a big reason for why we don't score as many goals is due to his style of play slowing us down against lesser teams.

Loftus-Cheek - Starting to show signs that he could be a good squad player, especially with his ability to play a few different positions and him beginning to show his ability to drive the ball forward. Needs to try to add goals to his game or at least add some uncertainty by getting shots on target.

Mount - Anonymous whilst he was on the pitch and hasn't yet had the same impact as he has had in prior seasons. Needs to step it up again.

Sterling - Excellent again despite being brushed off the ball a bit too easily at times. Should have haf a hattrick but his two goals were both excellent, albeit a bit fortunate on the first one. His movement for the second was what we lacked a lot laat year.

Havertz - Worked very hard and often held the ball up well however he is not a goal threat. If we get a striker in he needs to be able to transition to a different role where he can be more impactful as he had technical ability, but it is up to him to prove he can do that.

Pulisic - Worked hard in a difficult period when he came on. Another one who needs to offer more offensively.

Kovacic - Could tell he wasn't 100% fit when he came on.

Chilwell - Too late to make a huge impact but made an important header at the back post to stop a potential shot on target.

Azpilicueta - Got caught out a few times defensively. Not good enough to play week-in-week-out anymore but a good backup to have for a year.",What's the point of VAR? Really,Nah Pulisic can't start. He couldn't help.... This is a warning sign but I hope Boehly and co. saw this and decided the time for action is now. Get Auba and let's keep it moving. This team needs attacking bite in the worst way.
114,We’re also learning how crap mid table sides are. We lose literally every game and we’re nailed to the 10th spot.,"Really proud of Chelsea tonight.

Felix plays with some guile. Madueke wasn’t very good today, but at least the lad tried to do something with the ball. Mudryk just needs to get the ball more. 

Potters gameplan is head scratching, but I think we could get a lot more if he pushed his players. It really seems like he’s too soft spoken to inject anything into a lot of these guys.",Auba is washed. We really need to stop buying old ST. We hv history of buying strikers past the prime too often,"Clueless board hiring a clueless manager. 


Board: We still haven't bought a backup RB and Jorginho will be our only fit PL quality midfielder in a week or two.

Manager: Playing Azpilicueta even though his legs are clearly gone and giving goals away for fun. Playing Havertz as a striker with Mount behind him even though its never worked. And you finally have a match fit Kovacic and you decide to play Zakaria next to him instead of Jorginho lmaooo fucking abysmal from Potter. Absolutely overran in midfield and on our right hand side and he couldn't see it.","It looks bleak right now but this humbling we're going through is needed it's foolish to think we can spend a shit ton and chop and change without it catching up to us. This squad is such a jumbled up jigsaw I'm not surprised how bad we've been in the league all 2022.

Potter needs to be braver, players like Gallagher shouldn't be getting any minutes let alone starting a big game. Whether you rate Havertz or not he has to start considering Aubameyang is a washed up poacher, with our creativity issues there's no point in him playing. How Mount gets back into the team when he's been awful for a while is beyond me he's the most protected Chelsea player I've ever seen.

If we're building a project start players who will be here long term like Chukwuemeka I understand he's had an injury before but he needs to be getting more minutes he's clearly very talented. Fofana might as well start games even if it's too soon because Ziyech won't be here long term and we lack so much pace and power in the attack.

The summer spending was so so poor, what serious club makes raheem sterling their marquee signing what was Tuchel thinking? Is he a bad player? No but he's someone you add when you have a team built and just need that little bit extra in terms of production/rotation. 

Signing Sterling and Aubameyang when our two strikers last season combined for less xG than Kane by himself (in a down year btw) is hilariously off the mark.

Bringing back Gallagher was insane he showed how limited he is at Palace he has no place in a top half premier league team, extending Azpi was also ridiculous he's been moving like an injured tortoise for a while now he should have been allowed to leave but no we want to show barca we got cojones. 

Hazard left in 2019 and even when he was here he had to shoulder the creative burden by himself. Signing countless strikers/second strikers and wingers like Sterling and Pulisic doesn't address the issues that followed in Hazard's wake. Pulisic you can argue brings some dribbling sure but where's the player in the final third that can thread a pass or dribble past multiple player's and create space for others to exploit. 

We don't have good wide threats nor do we have central creativity/passing in the final third signing an Aubameyang and Sterling just exacerbates the issues.

The attack isn't the only issue but a good attack can get you over the line more than a good defensive unit that struggles to score or creat high quality chances.","Koulibaly looks so bad, it's not even pointing fingers at him for the sake of it. He makes our entire back line nervous - sort of like when Kepa was really out of form and the defenders didn't want to pass to him. He mistimes every tackle and gets rinsed by anyone with pace.

Sterling I am so shocked at. He offers absolutely nothing for us other than 6 yard tap-ins and he's not even doing that consistently for us. To say he's been so prolific for years in the prem , he's been absolutely horrible for us. Forget the goals he's gotten, like the one today, it hasn't taken much to get to Chelsea top scorer for him. He's such a bad signing. 

Aubameyang already looks like he's been tossed to the side from the manager. He's right in front of goal today and he just needs to let the ball to hit him in his face for it to go in and he can't even do that.

Havertz just didn't offer us anything today. He's so inconsistent that we have to include him in the bucket of players which we need to move on in order to rebuild our squad","If Tuchel were still manager and had 1 win in 8 in the PL then everyone would be calling for a change. 

Potter deserves some leeway but I don't know how much, especially because more losses are coming this month. Sitting in 10th got Lampard sacked.","The good: Mount, Cucu, Kepa, Silva, 

The okay: Havertz, James, Sterling, Pulisic, KK, Zakaria

The bad: Jorginho",When it rains it fucking pours,Welcome to reality boyzzx,"This defeat had been coming after the recent games against Villa, Brentford and United. And the performance was par for the course this season. Another poor one to add to the list.

The game was also the same as many of the ones in the latter part of Tuchel's reign. Abject going forward and prone to making defensive mistakes at the back. Kepa - and maybe the new manager bounce - managed to cover this for a few games but it has reared its ugly head again.

Watching 5 minutes of Gallagher and thinking he is a disciplined pivot player and then starting him in that position against a team that presses relentlessly. Strike 1

Playing the best attacker (who is a fullback which is already an indictment on management) at RCB is just awful. Against Son? OK. Against Rodrygo and Dan James? Why? Strike 2

Nothing he can do about the Senegal guys losing their heads. Maybe that's a goalkeeping coach issue.

It's such a low probability that all the attackers are this bad. Sterling and Cucurella seem to be the only ones that actually move with anticipation in the final third. Weird that they recently transferred from teams that play with great positional movement. 

Tuchel got a lot of goodwill with the CL but that's gone. The attack is atrocious. Tuchel wants to get a whole new forward line as well? He won't last long enough to change it, he has to change to a formation that maximizes their potential now. 

If none of the attackers know what to do in final third, what's stopping Tuchel from implementing the automatisms that Conte did? Yeah, it will be predictable but it would at least give them a foundation to make quicker decisions. Hopefully this is the reverse Conte where he switches to a formation that puts an extra attacker or midfielder further up the pitch."

Kova looks like he should still be resting, Broja can atleast hold the ball and go 1on1 but the rest is completely toothless. With Tuchel you atleast had a game plan, Chilwell and James are out so Potter got a small excuse but he also had a couple of games now so show his vision of Chelsea. 

Well, Potter got some time to show how good he really is. Maybe even buy some creative midfield player or someone for the wings how can win the 1on1.","On a very unrelated note, Europa League anthem is a banger tbf","1-1 a fair result, they started best but completely even game after Kova came on. Even though Potter got the lineup wrong initially, I think plaudits for him to acknowledge it and be quick to change.","Very concerning coaching from Potter today:

\- lineup didnt make sense at all

\- sterling as a wingback doesnt work

\- chuck was decent but lets be honest no need for him on this match

\- keeping havertz for so long was criminal, should been subbed of way earlier

\- Pulisic performance really exposed the coach, him over Havertz any day",That offside goal at the end summed up our shooting really,"That ""world cup"" is a joke",How the fuck have we lost to Dinamo fucking Zagreb… Absolute shambles,Love Kepa telling him off though,"That goal was so scripted lmao

But in all seriousness a fucking great hit. Hope this win slowly changes things.",Tuchel was doing a horrendous job.,Once again players fail to deliver in the final third. Sick of the indecision in the box. Dominated another game and got nothing. Potter got a lot to do but looks like same old same old. Dominate a game a game fail to take chances and concede after a counter.,What are the chances that Kepa is favored over Mendy? Kepa has looked amazing these past few matches.,Too harsh for the red. Penalty yes. Also the ref gave stupid fouls for us and them and giving yellow cards like cookies. Also Tonali should have received red like ages ago.,,Not how I expected the second half to go.,We shouldn't have won but I really don't care,Cash and Bailey were linking wel down that side surprised Bailey was taken off,"I think people are overcrediting Havertz a bit, he still struggled with the same things he has for awhile now, though I get he’s not a natural striker and will never perform well there and I appreciated his second half hustle. That said, thrilled that the team gritted out the win and all bets are off when you’re down a man so early so I’m certainly not trying to make any negative proclamations about any player in that situation. Onward to Tuesday!

Also need to add the requisite, thank all the deities for Reese and Thiago Silva.","Death, taxes, and getting robbed by the bald cunt Anthony Taylor.",Does anyone have a good joke to make me feel better?
117,Anyone still trust the process?,"Check bvb post match thread for a laugh.

They are having some weird “chelsea bought the ref” and “the little man vs the billionaires” type narrative.",You can see what it meant to them at full time. Not as convincing of a win as we would like but let’s hope we can ride the momentum. Needed a win more than a great performance.,"I don’t think ALL the criticism Potter has gotten over the past months has been fair… but this was a pitiful, pathetic performance. And it starts with him. How you take out our 2 best performers of the season (Reece, Thiago) in a MUST WIN game is unfathomable to me. Not to mention pairing Enzo with Kova when they’ve never played together before!!! No words. 

He won’t get sacked so I don’t think it makes sense to drag him for long after this loss. I hope he gets better, and he may, but that does not take away from this atrocious shit show we all were forced to witness today.",Southampton should squeek out a draw vs chelsea,"Mudryk plays a few bad passes - gets subbed off

Mount plays bad since the start of the season - still plays every match.",This squad is full of very exciting talent now.

And people say we are acting fast under this ownership.

And what is woth Todd is cooking, he is rocking my world thing. Every single one of our signing has been wank. Cucu doesn't do anything in attack, yet everytime is out of position for oppositions counter attack, overpaid for him. Setling is invisible for a guy that Todd has made one of the highest earners in PL. KK has been bad. Fofana has bern injury prone for such a big fee signing.

Fired a top coach, gave Potter such a big contract. Last team in the league is schooling us. Let's say prople are right that Tuchel's time here was over, is this what you are okay with then? This is better? Give time to at least a manager who deserves it, ManU giving yime to Ole did jack shit. Potter hasn't improved us yet.

Even this draw was because of a lucky goal. Potter doesn't need to have 300m more and 5years to not just win, but to just not get outclassed by Forest. And results etc are different thing, the guy has supposedly full backing and trust of owners, then in these situations atleast show guts to bring Omari and Chukwuemeka a bit earlier. Didn't even bring them when we were 2 up last game. He isn't showing one thing to back him for. Yet goes on to talk big and take digs on fans after 1 good half last game.

If owners aren't all talk and actually have ambition, they need to get a better coach. Give time to a guy who deserves it. I have no personal fight with Potter, I hope if we stick to him that he turns out good, I do, I just don't see it.","Even though we lost, if we play with that’s energy for the rest of the season. I can’t be mad with whatever the results are

Lots more minutes for Zakaria to come",100% win rate in Dec!!,"It's all a bit wimpy isn't it. 

Didn't unsettle them at all, didn't impose physically, no conviction in the final product.","Eddie Howe always seems to know how to destroy us.  It's starting to get irritating.  

Also, can we please play progressive forward passes instead of constantly being scared and back-passing?  We were doing multiple back-passes extra time, for crying out loud.","Please stop playing Sterling and Pulisic as WBs.

Either play them in their natural positions or just don't play them at all.

Both completely out of their depth there.  

They're not like Davies who has the strength and pace to recover whenever he makes a mistake.

Sterling was turning the ball over for fun and Pulisic looked like a kid lost in a mall.

Both heavily involved in the 3rd goal as well.

Please it needs to end here.","Pathetic from the players at the end, can’t close a game out for shit","This one is on Graeme, he took a gamble resting main players, an audacious gamble but it didn't pay off and if we don't win Sunday it will backfire badly.","amazing performance we dominate city at there home ,I can see potter winning CL in a season or 2","You make a good point, not really any reason for chilly to play a full 90 like that.",What has happened to mason mount? I don’t think he’s been this in the dumps since his debut.,"could've seriously injured Silva, should've been carded","A bit off the pace, but quite understandable after coming back from 2 week break with a new manager.

Very happy with the win, but the footy we're playing right now is fucking dreadful. We move and improve.",He is Chilwell from a parallel universe. Can’t convince me otherwise.,"So, if we are not going to sign any miedfielders is it time for Tuchel to dust off Gilmour?","We need to have an inquiry about that Cucu challenge.... fucking bring the shit cunt to court aswell, restraining order from our matches","Okay, here’s my take:

-This performance was abysmal, no doubt about it and no other way to mince those words. Can’t spot the team 2 goals before deciding it’s time to play. 

-More importantly, we have not learned anything new about this team. All the problems that were there two weeks ago are here now. You lack a cutting edge in the attack and you can’t finish. Those problems aren’t new.

-Fan bases, especially in this sport, are incredibly reactionary. Last week, we couldn’t stop talking about Tuchel’s “tactical masterclass” and now all the posts say he should be sacked. 

I get why, though. When you have a good performance, it’s easy to forget certain struggles. When you lose and lose big, you want quick fixes to everything. That’s life."
118,Goodbye Potter,Seemed strange to bring Pulisic on at such a critical moment as he looked way off it,Havertz getting full 90 is crazy tho,What a disaster….,"It seems like they are JUST starting to gel together.

Felix is so good with his flexibility in position and with his dribbling skills and technique, he was always dangerous

I feel like Mudryk is still kinda lost on where to stand or what his role is. He seems invisible at points in the game but when he got going, his passes were dangerous. Still needs work

Thiago Silva is always great. Very important man.

I feel like chilwel was one of the worst performing player in the pitch. His side was exposed so many times and it feels like he is scared to get injured again.

Havertz.... Man if only he is much more physical and aggressive in holding the ball and have that striker mentality to be selfish and just shoot he's be so good... his hold up play is great but it feels like he is very conservative and always passing instead of shooting. If he becomes a firminho type of player with two great wingers, we're set

Ziyech is a one trick pony. Ahhh

All in all, great game tbh. Just unlucky","Every single signing is 10 times better than our core of the team. Kai, Mount, Gallagher, Ziyech, Cucurella are all championship level players at the moment.","Potters record is tragic. The squad isn't that bad at all.

Madueke was pretty awful today but I hope it works out for him",Ordering my Mudryk shirt as we speak,"Not sure if Potter bad or just plain unlucky. Key players out injured, backups suck, and now another key player out for a stupid reason.

Our injuries are actually the only reason why I'm giving Potter the benefit of the doubt. Not even tuchel could handle it.",Under normal circumstances id say Potter out if he loses again Fulham. But with this injury crisis I don’t know who could come in and makes things better,Potter Out,Hutchinson needs to be playing in the championship. Not good enough for Chelsea atm,This. Hopefully we get a string of matches to let them work out the kinks.,"The most pathetic performance I've seen since last week. World Cup break can't come soon enough, need Fofana, James, Kouli back ASAP.","Told y'all, its gonna be like this for quiet a while I feel. Nkunku is likely reconsidering his options as I type this","It will be a miracle if we qualify for the champions league, and honestly Potter doesn’t bring nothing new to this team he’s playing exactly like TT","That is so fucking annoying. Spurs all over again, start defending and concede on the last minute","I can't believe how this sub is literally 10mo too late in realizing Kai gets WAY more minutes than he deserves. 

Been saying this for a LONG while and said similar about Timo as well long before anything was done about him. 

I LOVE Kai as a person. He's young. He's going to keep getting better (I hope), but enough is enough. 

- Gallagher should be inserted similarly as Kante
- Broja looked okay, but lacked the energy / hunger he has shown as a sub
- Puli, again, looked like our most threatening player. If he hasn't deserved a start, I'm convinced he just wanks off during training. This is ridiculous at this point.
- Kepa. So happy to see him doing well. I was vocal in benching him for Mendy. And I love Mendy. He was a beast. But he just hasn't looked the same since Afcon or so. Kudos to Kepa coming on when given a chance and making the most of it. The #1 is his to lose now, imo. 
- We miss RJ so much. Azpi is doing well, very well all things considered, but we really miss RJ.

I would love to see Sterling and Puli given a string of games together.  I don't know what lineup changes to need to happen. Mase seems undroppable to me... so yeah. But if Puli doesn't get a string of starts.... something is messed up.","Feel good positives from the game -

We don't care about the energy drink cup.

We put up a fight as always but it was City.

Arsenal & Spurs are out too.",Trash win,Embarrassing again. Like every other match this season so far,What a cunt,"I know people have been clamoring for 4 ATB since Frank left but this team is built better for 3 ATB right now. 3-ATB allows Reece and the LWB more license to push forward and provide width in the final third and crosses from the byline. It also covers up the fact that we don’t have a holding CDM in the squad (unless Zakaria is that guy - but it seems like we’ll never know). And we have 3 CBs taking up spots on the bench today, one of which was highly regarded and hasn’t seen the pitch yet under Potter.",Im interested in people who went to the bridge for the first time today... What did you like/dislike and what was your first impression?,It’s time we start fucking docking these players pay if they can’t beat the first man with a cross. Who do they think they are on that fucking money spamming every cross and corner into the first man? Bunch of useless pricks.,"Good win in the end. First half was a bit scrappy at times, but we looked more comfortable in the second half with some nice passages of play being created. This is the sort of win that can be built upon further moving forward.

The only real disappointment was Fofana's injury, hopefully it's not as serious as it possibly sounds or looks. 

Also hope people took notice of Tomori. While he's been good for AC Milan since joining, as someone that does follow Serie A these sloppy moments aren't unusual for him to see. Maybe it'll settle a few of the noisy bunch that bang on about how selling him was a mistake. Don't get me wrong he's a solid defender generally speaking, but he's not that player that's truly regrettable.","Italian teams are bad juju, every time we win we lose a major player.",,"What's worse, giving up 2 to Southampton or only scoring 1 vs Southampton?",How were 5th when we’ve been so shit is beyond me. I have to believe that when the squad gels and we get some players back we’ll kick on. To play poorly and win is a good habit to get into. I’ve only seen us play well once and we drew so it’s a funny one so far.,Shouldnt play cucurella for any cb position. He doesnt possess any aerial ability and so clumpsy today. He didnt even know what he suppose to do there.,"I know Trevoh made some mistakes but he did really well too, and so did RLC. Obviously Reece James and Silva were perfect. I love this team. What a showing",Was such a good game of football but of course Anthony Taylor had to be in the spotlight.,Mendy let us down like De Gea did Man U last week. If that goal doesn’t happen we stay completely fine but the goal fucked up. Then a blatant dive on the second and shitty defending from us and game was over.
119,"Emma Hayes needs to walk in to the men's squad and regain mentality. Potter hasn't got it. Three weeks ago I was Potter in, wanting Potter to last but after Southampton I switched.

He's making us the worst team in the country.",So happy for this win and especially happy for Graham Potter. Now to keep the momentum going.,People moaning about that performance but also want Jose back.🤷‍♂️,Potter is shit.   It’s not controversial Brighton fans agree - he’s a feel good loser.   Would you trust him to make a decision with your mortgage?   Honestly will argue with anyone that says yes,"The only positive I can think of right now is that we are playing more through balls lol. 

Somethings gotta give. Our luck in the final third has been cosmically bad. I believe the floodgates will open once we break through this drought.",Very poor from Potter. Got 2 weeks of training with an almost fit team and there doesn't seem to be any improvement,"Potter out, weak timid midtable manager

End it now before it gets even worse, 2 wins in  15+ games or so is insanity

Also send headless Chicken Cucurella back to Brighton along with Potter","Game was there for the taking, so a bit disappointed, but once that settles this was another step in the right direction.

With Reece, Felix, Kanté, Fofana, Chilwell, Mudieke, Mudryk in the mix we will play Fulham - West Ham - Southampton - Spurs - Leeds - Leicester - Everton - Villa - Wolves - Brighton in our next 10 games. 6 of them at home. We are going on a run.","Havertz makes that pass to Felix and we'd have won the game. How be stayed on the pitch for 90 is baffling. Absolute waste of time, space and money.",My biggest issue with the match today is that Potter is forced to play most of the players again next week lol,Praying Enzo wasn’t watching the match hahaha,"Very impressed with Chuk, Zak, Hall, Kova and Havertz played well in midfield. Much better from K2. Auba was terrible. Cucurella was fine apart from the 15 mins after half time.

Im just happy that we didn't default to five at the back and actually matched up.

For all the Ziyech fanboys. This is what he offers. A whipped cross and giving the ball away by running into his defender or leaving the ball behind himself after trying a stepover.","Thought the same.

Zero positives and zero fucking points",I’ve seen enough. Bring back Tuchel,"Incredibly frustrated with Sterling. I know we're all frustrated with our other young forwards who absolutely should be doing better.

1. Our reaction after their second goal was not good, taking the foot off the pedal and letting them Control the game was a bad move.

2. Although we were more direct today, this team needs a lot of improvement in terms of Final ball and Finishing.",This team fucking SUCKS. 70% of the players need to gtfo.,I never want Thiago Silva to leave.,Leao on the wing vs Azpi gonna be brazy 🥶🥶🥶,,"Simply not good enough. Bullied and beaten all over the pitch.

Desperately need a midfielder who can actually get the ball forward quickly, and it looks like Broja deserves to be starting ahead of Kai up top when he's fully fit. Looked far more dangerous in 50% of the time that Kai had.","Not too many positives to take away from this win. Nice to see we have resilience to come back from 1-0 down and win. Also nice to see Kai and Ben playing well and scoring. 

Besides that, awful. We just dumped a fortune almost exclusively into the defense yet our defense is shit. Still no midfield presence and everyone is still afraid or unable to play creatively and be threatening. I'm not optimistic for Auba, he's going to get no service.",Mendy's gonna need to climb a mountain to take his position.

This is some of the weakest Chelsea I’ve ever seen. Not just from a footballing standpoint, mentally as well.

The only time I’ve been this frustrated with our team was in the final days of Conte’s reign when the players downed their tools.

Potter can’t turn this around. Unfortunately I think it’s time to part ways. He won’t get these players to believe in him.","Listening to these absolute twats on stan sport complaining about the penalty. It's clearly a pen. Fucking madness.

I haven’t seen a tactical/strategic improvement or identity. Our players haven’t been improving individually, they’ve actually gotten worse. So what does Potter bring?",Moutinho would never let this happen.,"Koulibaly having John Terry’s number is one of the most disrespectful things the club has ever let happen, he’s the worst defender I’ve ever seen in a Chelsea shirt",i'm convinced that cucurella was one of those transfers Bohely forced upon Tuchel because his data analysts told him so and Tuchel accepted with a sigh just because he spent all his negotiating power on rejecting Ronaldo. He was awful today.,"Puli and Mount have always had good chemistry I feel.

Lampard might have something to do with that... they came up/joined the team at the same time, saw regular play time, both performed well for their newness to the team/PL, and have consistently found good link ups (especially against Madrid!)",That is one of the worst goals I have seen us concede. Heads dropped after the goal. This team needs a lot of work,Team looks clue less,"Today's loss is on Potter 100%. We are with Potter in the long haul, it seems so he will be given time to learn and get things right. 
It is unfortunate whatever happened in the summer, but our signings have all been so questionable. Marina was hit and miss but this summer has been a miss completely. 

As for today's performances, we lost it tactically. There were good performances from Kai (all the unnecessary hate for him. His first touches were sublime and he was the only attacking outlet that we had) and Gallagher who I thought was magnificent, he had 2 huge chances in first half and provided an amazing assist for the goal. Some atrocious performances in there and let us admit it, Thiago Silva has been single-handedly papering over the cracks within our defense for so long. Sterling needs to be booted out of the team, please. I'm okay with Pulisic starting despite his performance today as he deserves a chance to get a run of games but Sterling has been borderline poor and needs to earn his place back. Hope Kepa can return soon. 

Bitter bitter loss to take and in all honesty, this might be a very very rough season by our standards. Top 4 looks difficult with the competition in the premier league this season, so I'll keep my hopes down.

Way too much overaction on here and on other socials about this Chelsea team, Potter, and tonight's performance. We were always likely to lose tonight, and we probably will again on Sunday; sections of our fanbase need to wake up to the fact that we are simply not good enough to beat City at the moment. No matter who plays, and no matter who the manager is.

  
I am happy that Potter is willing to take the risky decision of bringing the youth on, especially when the game is gone. As soon as City scored the match was wrapped up, we only came back into it because they took their foot off the pedal.  


We aren't getting relegated, ignore any of that waffle; and we aren't getting top four this year, so what do we have to lose?","Yeah I like an attack that gets all of these guys together. Havertz, Sterling, Mount, Pulisic   playing together allows us to get most of the attack, just need the midfield to be able to handle it too. Lets see how Zakaria develops for us, I didn't really have much hope for him but at least he offers something different, we still need an upgrade or hope Kanté sorts out his injury issues but at the very least someone is there who can provide that.

Every attack we had was far too slow, they were able to set up and we never really got anything going because of it. Also, we need to sort out our runs in the box, too often two players make the same run and the spacing is terrible.

“PLasTiC!”","After a long time I got to see proper passion from Chelsea. The team performed really well and came into the game fully knowing the job they had to do. 

Kai and Chilwell both had standout performances today. For me personally, I think Chilwell was the MOTM, he was great offensively and did some crucial tackles, though he did pick up an unnecessary yellow card. Special shoutout to Kovacic as well, was really crucial today and did well with the captains armband. 

Sterling was really lucky to score, cause otherwise he wasn't great. I'm actually really afraid going forward regarding him as he always seems to find himself offside, I mean we all remember that city game, and today as well he was caught offside loads of time.

Idk what pulisic was smoking, he should've seen Gallagher's run towards the end, but it's his first game since injury so imma let it slide, but still was lowkey pissed at that time.

I think Potter did well today, especially with the team selection. A step in the right direction, and if he keeps up this performance it would be an exciting future for Chelsea.

I was initially questioning why we need 2 mids and thinking that would probably be excessive. But todays match made me realise how much of a overhaul is needed. Zakaria is utility quality. J5 is absolutely awful in trying to create something against low blocks or keeping control in counters. Kovacic cancels the positives he creates after winning back position through the form of misplaced passes or just releasing it to the wingers. RB depth is a must, this game showed me that Azpi is truly past it. Good to see that Badiashile has been signed, hope he can turn it around.","We're about 6-7 signings and 2-3 managers behind City at the moment.

I'm so deflated watching Chelsea play.","When the others are moving around him and he can play 1-2 touch football he’s excellent. I think when he gets a break this summer he could learn from drogba and costas technique when running with the ball becuase havertz is excellent at using his size in the air or to keep possession but never uses his size when dribbling, just get the sense that might really open up his game cause his technique is world class","Honestly no complaints from me. We didn't deserve to win. Out played in literally every single aspect. Miracle it was 1-0. I just cannot believe how dead we are without James and Kova.

It was clearly a 3-5-2 with Cucurella - Silva - Azpi behind Sterling - Mount - Jorginho - Kovacic - James.

And I'm afraid we may need to endure this until the end of the season. Why would Potter give a shit about fixing this?

On one hand Potter looks out of his depth and seem to lack the tactics abilities to change the flow of a game when things aren't working. 

On the other, it seems no amount of coaching is going to account for the sheer amount of utter incompetence that the majority of the players have. Brain dead tackle. Awful individual decisions. Absolutely moronic errors more or less every game under a multiple different managers. Some of who are lauded for their tactical excellence. 

I honestly don't know if a new manager would fix the issues we have. There are so many. Medical, tactical, coaching, recruitment, it's seem endless. 

This is the culmination of years of poor management,  bad decisions and short sightedness. It will likely take quite a while to fix it all too. 

You could argue that the new ownership appears to be attempting to put the pieces together with the recruitment of certain staff for particular roles. 

The players, sheesh. How bad is this bunch. Don't think I've ever seen such little effort before. Where's the pride. So much money spent and virtually none of our recent signings have been anywhere close to successes. 

So much needs fixing and I don't know if a new manager would make much difference.","They're going to blame it on injuries.  That's a problem, but not THE problem.  They're disjointed and don't care.  Well done Boehly",It’s actually remarkable that the only time we’ve looked good in the last 7 league games is the 50 or so minutes James played. I just don’t get it,"As I said in the match thread, I just don't get excited for our games any more. Before Boehly and Potter I at least thought we would give any team a run.

Relatively solid in midfield and out the back but clueless once it was time for the forwards to get involved. 

Obviously a lot of talk was about how much we missed Reece but frankly I find it unacceptable that we're so reliant on a right back for all of our attacking threat. Even if we do find a back up they probably won't be as much of a help as Reece. We need productivity from our front line so we can be a team that doesn't care if their right back is injured.",Good point in my opinion.

Its staggering, can't remember consistently seeing decent ratio. Tonight Flashscore has us at 18 shots with 4 on target...been a problem for years","Agree with most of thoughts but want to add:

- they didn't play a low block against us. Possession was nearly equal, but we seemed to have more good chances. Still don't think we are on the right track until we beat the lower table teams parking the bus consistently

- if I'm pulisic and I was able to play, I'm 100% leaving in Jan after tonight. 6 attacking players get minutes but not him?  Hell. Gallagher got attacking minutes over him. Ouch. I love Pulisic and would rather just see him leave so he can play consistently. Would prefer he stay but it doesn't look like it's going to work out for him here

- starting to see potter's mindset. Gallagher getting minutes. RLC featuring. He wants athletes on the pitch. I think Jorgi and Azpi and Mendy are going to see fewer and fewer minutes. This could also be why Puli won't get minutes. He might not think Pulisic plays ""strong"" enough.

Silva was a beast and Trev was fantastic, as well as Mendy! We left too much on the plate but luckily we still won. It seems 3 atb can we work when we flood the midfield with 5.

We are a different beast when we play 3 at the back, and I'm glad mr. Potter finally sees the light. He's playing it to save his job, but if the consequence of that is that we find our form and get a good run of games together, then i'll take that.

Barring the opening 30-35 minutes, we really came into our own and were by far the better side, despite what the possession stats say.

I haven't watched a chelsea match that had so much fight in it for a very long time now, and my god is it a good feeling.

I have been Potter Out quite vocally. However, if this sort of performance continues in the next 3-4 games, then I will finally be willing to give potter more time. The onus is on him though, he's gotta maintain this run and he's gotta be smart with his team selections and game management. Let's see.",Man how tf is chillwell rated so low. He tracked a lot and had some amazing runs,"I’m fully on the Potter Out train after that.

Kai and Ziyech also very poor, when the ball falls to them you just have no confidence they’ll score. I don’t blame Kai for being a bad striker, but he is one and it hurts us so much.

Brentford are a well disciplined team but we knew that already, shame we couldn’t get it across the line.

Sterling should not be that close to the touch line. Cucurella needs to put on his shooting boots. I like what I saw from broja, pace strength and tenacity is exactly what we need and are missing from havertz. Speaking of havertz wtf does this man do on the pitch? For real like what is his purpose on this team. Kepa my man is on a mission. 

Anyway the one positive about this game is that we didn’t get embarrassed by Brentford again so I guess I’ll take that.",Hall deserves a first team call up after that performance,"I think Sterling on the right and Pulisic on left both have a place on the pitch. Havertz when he’s not down the middle isn’t particularly inspiring, and with a back 4 (please) instead of 5 should have room for all of them to get plenty of game time",Disasterclass from Mount and Ziyech. Difference is one isn’t starting for a long time and the other is probably starting against Fulham,"> Great win in a tough stadium

They were 40 games unbeaten at home. I know a lot of that is in the Austrian BuLi, but that's still an impressive record.","Winning when you look like shit is the mark of a good side, but still—you get the feeling that this group of players adds up to less than the sum of the parts. I have no idea what’s going on with Mount and Kova (and Havertz to a lesser extent), but it’s been ugly.",Does anyone have the video of Caesar throwing the offender off him,How the fuck do they manage to be so shite at shooting? Do they not practice? Nobody can hit the fucking target it’s pathetic,Even though Reece pocketed him. Leao seems like a real good player esp against average rb he will do well against a low block.

we should go for tielemans what a player",Match Fixing. That’s what Anthony Taylor and VAR did. Flat out robbed.,"Why is he playing havertz as a 9, why is he playing mount as an inside forward, why is connor playing as b2b, why is RLC playing wingback, why is reece playing as RCB

His insistence to play players out of position just so we can keep our 343 shape will be our downfall. I mean no wonder neither midfield and forwards worked and in return it put further pressure on defense when you try to fit square blocks into circles.

He keeps on saying this shape must be played due to Thiago and Jorginho's lack of speed then why try to get another CB instead of a midfielder."

Yes Potter deserves blame for today. Yes Boehly deserves blame for this circus.

The players also deserve blame. Potter cannot score for them.

You can want him out but do not devolve into toxic insult or wishing harm against anyone. You’re better than that.

Feels like a real intervention is needed this week with the club.",Havertz time is done I think. Millions spent but we really need a centre forward more than any position and have done since the start.,"Please fuck can we sack Potter now, outside of a new manager bounce he has shown NOTHING to indicate he should be in charge.

And I’m really not interested in his apologists pointing to his time at Brighton. Look at the league table there a whole host of clubs outperforming expectations and nobody is suggesting we go get those managers, not to mention Brighton is doing just fine without him.",Poch would’ve been a better project manager. His CV is gravy compared to potter.,"It's eye-opening that Felix's 60mins and Mudryk's 35mins were miles better and more promising than anything Mount and Havertz have shown this entire season. Mount gets way too long of a leash, he should be dropped next match","This is too much for Potter. He a mid coach who has now been handed Championship level players.

He managed a game a week at Brighton which was at his peak. He needed a week to make his tactics work. Now at Chelsea with almost 3 games a week he has no time to implement nor work on his tactics.

The games seem to come at him fast. We can see that because of the fact that the team has no philosophy or a game plan.",If Potter survives this then I am done with this club,Potter isn’t entirely to blame but ffs you can’t beat forest with this cast?,"Lewis Hall with a better performance than Cucurella.

Looks so dangerous on the ball, whereas the more Sterling is on the ball the worse he looks",Well that was fucking dreadful…. Again,PotteryBall,🙏💙,"What a great game, honestly the best I've felt for a while after a game. To get 3 points, a 3-0 win, while rotating and getting good performances out of players who aren't necessarily part of the ""best 11"", just immense. 

Special shout out to Mason and CP who I've always felt had good chemistry. Mason was *awesome* in this game, and CP's finish was fantastic and a lot harder than he made it look. Could also shout out a bunch of other people, so many deserve it.",Sterling looked piiiiiissed,"Happy with the result. But need updates on Fofana's injury.

Another shit performance. Chillwell needs to start from now on. Mendy creates a panic on every situation. We have a 50% chance of conceding on any set pieces. Not sure what’s happening. We need to really tighter our defense. 

Also, we are going nowhere with RLC and Jorgi. They have zero creativity. I don’t know when we will solve the problem of chance creation",Lucky FC for real,"Thiago Silva best player, Kai Havertz great shithousery and pretty good header, cucurella so energetic, sterling 2 goals, mendy great goalkeeping, Gallagher actually pretty decent apart from the sent off",I’ve never felt this angry at a ref in my life.

Just another day at the office for Potter.


Mediocre all around .",So Potter prefered Pulisic who seems like cant properly run yet than Mudryk..,There is probably going to be a lot of negativity around the performance but. WE WON A F*CKING GAME LETS GOOOOOOOOOO,"Potter got a team that finished 3rd one year ago, won CL 2 years ago, has half a billion invested in the squad and still was able to turn it in mid table club that is close to relegation battle. Please let that sink in for a moment!","We okayed very well. Bad luck and shit finishing, Potter is definitely not to blame for this one, he did everything right. We play that every weekend and we are in the top 4.",Potter has been nothing but disappointment. I hope Boehly has a plan B if Potter can't improve the team.,"Not sure how this can continue really, hes pretty lucky we have Southampton as our next home game who are somehow worse than us. 

He is just completely out of his depth, no tactics, no shape, subs are awful.

Times up for Potter I think.",Mount and Gallagher been beyond dreadful this season,Fuck Graham Potter fuck Todd Bohely,Potter out.,"When Tuchel was at Chelsea it really felt as if we were a group working for each other, almost family vibes. Now we just seem like a bunch of distant relatives that don’t really want to be there.",Fuck it if this is a rebuild play the youth every game. Lower than Brighton what a shitshow,"Probably wouldn't have agreed before the world cup, but I agree now. Sterling and pulisic either side of havertz is just so much more dynamic than having auba in there","Well that was dire. Not as bad a score line as I was expecting, mind you, but awful nonetheless. RLC needs to sit for awhile, as does Havertz, and Potter needs to stop sticking with a formation that clearly doesn’t work when we have so many starters out injured. I’m not even mad, just kinda numb.","For the last four games we have started with a 343 and switched to a 433 when we have realised that we are not capable of doing it. Tuchel switched to 343 because under Lampard we looked like conceding from a deflection from the half way line. He built the defensive structure/understanding/confidence. What never came with it was the understanding of how to create passing lanes and space to retain/progress the ball under pressure. 

Now, we concede as many chances in a 343 as a 433 but with far less control in the middle. The simple fact is that in a 343 the two CMs have to be athletic freaks to make up for lack of bodies in that area. We don't have that.","Honest take. Havertz/Pulisic/Silva/Chalobah were noticeably poor to me. Sterling was bad as well but he created our best chances of the first half. Pulisic was as bad but has none of the same chance creation, he pretty much just did nothing. Silva had many mistakes on the ball today. Havertz scored a great header, which is the only attribute he offers, on the feet he has nothing in his locker. Chalobah cannot defend 1vs1 at all.   
 

Potter lost us the game, first half was a disaster there was too much space on the wing, Cucurella was in a constant 2vs1 battle. He did rectify that 2nd half by balancing the wings by placing RLC.","Very frustrating performance. A bit tired of this team tbh. Can’t keep giving up goals in injury time. Need to bring in some killers come January and Summer, cause some of these lads just don’t have it.",Christ that was abysmal,"RLC, Ziyech, Havertz and Pulisic out now",pulisic mount gallagher all have good chemistry together but ngl i think potter definitely has his favourites and we'll probably see sterling start sunday,This somehow feels much worse than the Leeds game. What is the plan? Our attack is just aimless.,"I'm happy that atleast we didn't collapse after going ahead

Much better from us","It feels good to win games, we should start doing that more often. Feels good to have a striker who can score a goal like that as well, was the last goal of that type we scored the Mount volley in that Norwich drubbing? 

I will say that our last two wins have both come off the back of late, late winners, but fuck it, we take those. Hopefully we can get a bit more clinical as Potter gets more time to work out the kinks.",Kepa first choice from now on?,Good luck to everyone who has convinced themselves it was all Tuchel and Potter can turn these shite attackers into something. Our only hope is Broja taking a leap and helping out Raheem who’s literally carrying this attack on his back.,Idk if anyone else caught it but there was a fan celebrating Reece’s goal in the third kid inspired fleece tech hoodie. Did I miss the release of it?,"We completely took the foot off the pedal man

That's what I never liked and hope Potter improves that aspect",,God our formation is really not working out. Mount and Havertz are not it in this style of play. We need one of them to play as a playmaker because right now we have nothing to connect our midfield with our attack. Teams know how to play against a wingback formation and we don’t have anout and out centerforward.,"please bench mendy, such a bad GK",Chalobah was so meh again it's ridiculous. Cucurella was too but Chalobah is so average everytime he puts on a shift,"Amazing amazing from everybody involved bar Gallagher who I never wanna see again tbh

Mendy confident after last week slip up, chalobah was good maybe got spun by vardy but it’s okay he had to step up today and he did played two different positions throughout the game aswell

Thiago silva holy heck to perform like this at his age he’s the best in the league surely

Loved Azpi coming in and reassuring everything thought TT approach to the match and the switch post red card was world class management

Kai was a handful for defenders and even though he isn’t getting goals he’s contributing so much and is working super hard, up the chels big win for morale we showed grit",The club has to do something about this cunt Anthony Taylor.

We played really well, couldn't score and conceded an avoidable counter attack... Against a team undefeated in 2023. Good performance and positives to take for the return leg. We have to, have to be better at finishing.",They’ll need to replace every player on the pitch to figure out that Potter doesn’t know what he’s doing. We’ve scored 2 goals in 7 games…,Mount and Potter should stay. Stay at West Ham that is,"I have been very negative about our dealings and performances lately. But a draw and clean sheet at Anfield isn’t bad and there are signs of control in possession and some injection of urgency with the new signings.

Mudryk looked electric from his cameo and Badiashile has quietly adjusted.

With some players back from injury and Joao Felix to add in we should see some more positive performances.","If you're still defend Potter after this then you're part of the problem.

Dude is clearly so out of his depth, the best for both is that he resigns tonight.","Classic silver lining take here -

We have been screwed out of the last 2/3 stonewall FA Cup victories due to either biased/corrupt/or inept FA officials. (Then we lost the 1/3 fairly imo).

Regardless of my opinions on how they went down & how we should have two wins out of three - the history books say 3 FA Cup Finals lost in a row, I'm very happy that it won't now say 4. 

I'm also happy to be out of this bullshit domestic competition that clearly hates our club, at the earliest possible exit.  It's not like the FA Cup is even considered important anymore.  We've been blessed enough the last three seasons to have a discussion around what we needed more- Top 4 or FA Cup Final victory and everyone consistently went with Top 4. 

We could have won the FA Cup this year and finished 10th in the Premier League and the season would still be considered a massive fail, better to just be out of it early and hope that this big decrease in games from being out of both Domestic Cups, gives us greater rest & prep for matches we care about in the Premier League and most importantly now imo - the Champions League.","There are some theories that the “star”
players don’t respect potter as a manager because he’s just a dude from Brighton and doesnt have pedigree.","But hey guys at least we're top of the table in terms of character and fighting well, according to Potter","Agree, let’s run them out for 3 or 4 games at least","Shocking game and shocking from Potter as well. Seen nothing going forward today at all. It’s really bad. 

I’m sorry but Aubameyang can’t keep starting games against serious teams. He just offers nothing except goals which he can’t create for himself","Am American, firing Tuchel was a mistake.  Not because we got rid of Tuchel, but because we picked a coach that is just going to run the same formation and is even more sporadic with subs. He won us an UCL might’ve well just rode the season out.","Potter is repeating the same mistakes he has made in recent matches, and yet he continues doing the same thing expecting different results. Putting players out of their natural positions, playing Chilwell and Cucurella in the same game. I thought by now, he should have learnt e.g from the Man u game. This loss is on the coach more than the players. I didn't even bother watching the game, I knew the outcome the moment I saw the line up.. The only surprise for me was the scoreline, I didn't think we would be hammered that many/much or whatever","Okay, a draw is a fair result, but...

I’m really not sure all of the ball crossed all of the line. It's hard to see exactly, because Kepa brings it back a little before it rests on the line for a moment, but it looks like it might have been just in play throughout.

The 'goal decision system' graphic which shows it well over the line tells me exactly one thing: the goal decision system was not calibrated properly. It was a LOT tighter than that either way.",Havertz has to have dirt on everyone at the club. He’ll start regardless of form throughout the year regardless of manager. I have to rate the blackmail to be fair.,"Twitter is having a collective aneurysm but it was a good performance. Certainly better than our performances against City last season.

If having Potter sees some of the more childish members of our fan base drop off then he’s a Chelsea legend regardless of what happens on the pitch.","Came on, hit 9/9 of his passes, 11 total touches, played two good balls to Gallagher, and did that just in 7 minutes.  He's looking good.","Thank God, I didn't waste my time watching this.",Boy it looked pretty bad after Zagreb. Happy to be where we are now.,"Still time for adjustment. Not jumping to doomsday conclusions yet. 

Upside this showed we have players to come off the bench which will be vital in this next stretch of games. 

Allow the attack to gel under Potter better, get some guys in form and shore up the midfield.","I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Armando Broja. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Armando. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.","Same dross. I really hope we get rid of the ring of death that we form around the opponents third when we are trying to attack, does absolutely nothing. I want to curse the manager who embedded this style of play into us. Really did a number on this club.",No,We saw the real fik tomori the past two games. That’s his level. Kalulu is better than him,,Someone tell Pulisic he doesn't have to play with roller skates,Mendy is becoming a liability. Always looks shaky on the ball and makes some fucking stupid decisions.,Baffles me he has haters. But sure they're mostly all kids so ignore it. Anyone with common sense supports him,Amazing team effort. Everyone gets a 10 except for Gallagher.,You know it’s bad when even r/soccer can’t understand how it’s 2-2,Looking at city's attack makes us look so much worse 😭
131,"Worse winning percentage than Ian Porterfield and David Webb, and just think of the calibre of players they had available to them.",Little confusion whether Potter has instructed Kai and Raz to sit so wide when they defend. Rest-attack reasons due to BVB’s high FB’s or the threat with the overloads they create in wider regions. However it allows the CB’s way too much to time on the ball and transfer their free men advantage and in turn overload the sides,"Good first 20 minutes followed by the same drivel as always.  Unlucky to not score in first 20 and lucky to score when we did. 

Subs and surrender tactics at the end were maddening 

Leeds could have easily scored","Potter is the worst manager in the clubs 118 year history.

End our suffering Boehly.","We’re starting to look better. Please make yourself heard if you are also happy with the progress. It just hasn’t translated yet to the scoreboard but it’s inevitable it will as we’re finally building momentum. A Dortmund friend of mine said we looked really good and underestimated us. If outsiders see we are starting to get better, then surely we can see it too no?",No one can convince me that potter is capable of winning anything. He's clueless and massively out of his depth.,"How much time did Ten Haag need to start performing? Oh wait, about 3 games in.","Mason Mount have a fucking seat and wank.

Good effort from damn near everybody today. Attitude and effort has improved these last few games. Tough point prolly should’ve had more.

Encouraging debut. Ziyech and Cucurella had a great game. Thiago Silva is literally unmatched.",[deleted],"To people calling for Tuchel, let us go through some results from last season. A 91st minute winner needed to beat relegated Watford. A draw with Leicester. Draw with Wolves. Loss to Everton. Draw with United. 90th minute winner to beat West Ham. (These made up 6 of our remaining 7 league games). Comfortable loss to Arsenal and Brentford. 89th minute winner needed to beat Newcastle. 89th minute winner needed to beat Palace. Draw to Brighton. Loss to City. Draw with Liverpool. Draw with Brighton. Draw with Wolves. Draw with Everton. Last year was not this magic season where we actually done well. Teams like United, Spurs and Arsenal were all in transition. Chelsea, coming off the Champions league win, scraped by so many teams. The only difference between Potter and Tuchel is I think the players aren’t as mentally strong as they once were.
But time and time again we berate how poor our players are, how they lack consistency, how they aren’t creative and all of them have the initial instinct of passing back. We consistently criticise the lack of through balls and risk taking. That is absolutely not a managerial issue because it has been a common theme across Tuchel and Potter, both of which have been seen as attacking managers before coming here. These players are mentally weak, do not gel together, have little tactical awareness and many are not good enough technically. Change the players, bring in some actual leaders on the pitch like Silva, and we might see a change in fortunes. But keeping these players and expecting them to be a coherent battering ram is not it, because most are content with collecting their pay checks",We picked the wrong city player this off season. We needed a creative midfielder like Bernardo Silva,"# We are rubbish.

Better today than in past games, but if you think that is praise, you are clueless.","Yep, Sterling and Puli on the wings are a creative/progressive duo when they’re not wingbacks. Also really benefit from having a 9 play between them… really showed the few times they played in a top 2 together",I am so sick of us not giving a shit when we are down. We have shown 0 urgency the last 2 games we were behind and it is pathetic,"Everyone wants to chirp about how potter needs time and we are rebuilding, etc, but this is dire to watch and we have talent to at least be better then these results regardless of rebuilding needs. Potter hasn’t proven he can manage a big club and he sure as hell isn’t up to it so far.",Very awful numbers but there were some good things also. Havertz did well in my opinion. So did Gallagher. The attack is getting better. Bad luck and some defensive errors cost us the game. These kind of results just happen.,"Need to sign a DM in January so we can play 4 at the back more because we livened up the second we switched formations, I don’t care if it is Sangare, Alvarez, Rice we need a DM so bad","Why did i watch that shit till the end, it’s 22:30 over here","Koulibaly was at fault for both goals today - looked like a passenger out there 

Mendy is legitimately shocking with his feet but made some great save that Kepa probably wouldn’t have.  We have two aggressively mediocre keepers. 

Hall, Pulisic, and Zakaria all looked pretty good.  But our finishing is non existent. 

At least it’s fewer matches","Havertz was probably our best attacker this game, sure we need more consistency - but he should have at least 2 assist in this game.

Sterling and auba on yhe other hand should do more",Caught the last 30 minutes of the game. Saw 2 chances from Reece hitting the post and Jorginho cross to mount. That’s it. The team cannot create a clear chance the whole 30 mins,"Silva could legitimately be man of the match for 98% of our matches if we wanted.

Ngolo Kante went on a similar run for us","Still so disjointed all over the pitch. I get it’s a new manager/players, but nothing looked comfortable for us. Still, a win helps keep the morale up so we can hopefully get more fluid"," Sewy

Great, great performance from him.","Absolutely great performance after going down to 10 so early, but it’s mad when after spending 200mil, the person keeping us in the game was a 37 year old Thiago silva","That feels like a loss. Total gut punch. Both spurs goals had fouls overlooked beforehand. Taylor has it in for Chelsea, that much is obvious.

Call me deluded but I think we were really unlucky today.",Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck,"Tuchel said it himself. We still have the same players so we’re gonna have the same problems. I think we played pretty well tonight going forward. Both fulham goals were caused by mistakes from Chalobah.

I hate the back 5 if Reece/Chillly isn’t playing. You can see everytime we play the ball to Azpi the game slows down. 

I can’t believe all the Chelsea fans calling for Potters head. Those you who are have a lack of patience. You think hiring a brand new manager is gonna fix everything everytime?

get fucking Mourinho in or something idc anyone's better than this guy","We have the worst fanbase in the league. Too entitled, impatient, contradictory and abusive.","Mason Mount get the fuck outta my fantasy team, it’s the age of motherfucking Mykhailo Mudryk","If Boehly doesn't sign 2 midfielders then we are done. I'm just tired of listening to fans who say oh oh we don't need midfielders.

It's the moments like Mount passing to Azpi instead of Felix, is the reason why we need a midfielder.


Also, we need a B2B for carrying the ball forward. Felix was literally dropping as near as our goal to carry the ball forward because rest of the bums can't create space or move the ball forward.","There’s one thing that is rebuilding and there is playing like headless chickens. The players don’t even wanna win, they act like an average 9-5 worker who’s gotta feed his family and hence works like a corporate slave day in day out. There’s no passion, no aggression. The last time I saw Chelsea players playing for the badge was second leg vs RM. Since then there’s been ups and downs but this has been the absolute low. They walk on to the pitch and run around, go back after 45 mins, repeat. 

I expected to be down bad seeing the current scenario but that would have been acceptable if we had some positives, yet there are absolute none.",Shocking is all I have to say,"Hope all of you enjoy only losing 1-0

&#x200B;

Fucking shambles of a club","Zakaria looking so good just goes to show how badly we’ve needed a world class defensive mid for years now. Zakaria comes in and adds steel to our midfield, imagine what a top quality DM would do.",Drop sterling next match …. Do not use him at all,"So is sacking the manager what you all want?  I've followed the club since ~2008 and I can't think of another team that has gone through managers like we have.  We had some success with it.  More so early on when we still had Drogba, Lampard, Anelka, Ballack, etc. But over time it's not had the effect that it once did.  Now on top of that we have new management.

The reality is, these players aren't playing well at all.  So what do we do?  Sack Potter, bring someone else in.  Then what?  They are successful for a year, and then it all falls apart again?  This has been an issue for a very long time here. A very long time.  This team has been consistently inconsistent since before even Hazard came in.  Players start to perform poorly,anager gets sacked.  New manager comes in, we play well for a season, bam sacked.  Rinse and repeat.  

We need to solve the root issue once and for all.","Our fundamental problem is the players. Compare what we have rn to what we won the UCL with (which was still a squad that massively over performed) and we are worse in almost every area. 

Defence is basically the only thing that hasn’t gone to the dogs. We’ve gotten a couple solid CB and I appreciate our focus on youth, but still shelled out FAR to much for Cucu whilst leaving nothing for RB depth (whilst having our starting rb be both essential to our squad and injury prone). Imagine if we had just brought a couple of those Bundasliga wingbacks for 20 mil each instead of Cucu. 

I don’t even need to get into how neglected our Midfield is. When we are constantly starting RLC- a man as far from and England call up as I am from from going to mars- you can see the issue. The only other players are a shaky J8, a none existent Kante and an injury prone (albeit quality) Kovacic. It’s not as if we all knew we would have a midfield depth issue going into the season.

Our forwards meanwhile, are one of the most embarrassing displays in all of the big 6. How has not a single forward worked since Lockdown? Our best forward is Mount who is class about once per month. Sterling would be a great depth buy, but he has no form. What the fuck do we keep trying with Havertz? Why the fuck do we keep trying with Ziyech and Pulisic? Starting Auba as our number 9 we may as well pull Zola out of retirement. We create nothing and then struggle to put what we are given into the net.

To end this, what the fuck is keeping Potter from learning from his mistakes. Sterling doesn’t work at WB. Pulisic doesn’t work at WB. Havertz doesn’t work as a 9. Cucu doesn’t work as a CB. How many times does he need to be reminded of this? I fucking promise you as well that maybe 1 of these will change when we play Arsenal next week.","It’s honestly what we deserved, unfortunately.","How in the world referee was not checking any foul or handball? 

That last kick definitely hit his hand still he did not even bother to check. 

Ben mee should have been sent off as well. 

I think we created enough chance to score at least 1 goal. But our players think too slowly or take too many touches before the gap is closed. 

And for Havertz I think he should see the bench more often. I hate Pulisic but I think he deserves more time than Havertz on his current form.",Fun game to watch,Pulisic is a bench player unfortunately. Super sub,If you want these threads to be civil everyone needs to start reporting trolls.,Honestly should have had 3 or 4 goals,Love that it was a come from behind win. Hopefully this gets us rolling.,Really proud of our boys today! Great effort and work ethic from everyone. Even though we made 7 changes we still played very connected and looked good on the ball. Seems like our bench players are gaining some confidence which is crucial for our congested schedule. To top it all off our boy Broja bagged a great goal to start his chelsea account,"Overreactions aside I feel the following:

Pros:

Liked the overall setup.  We looked dangerous most of the game. 

Raheem looked very dangerous on the left flank

Cons:

Couldn’t get the result

I have never seen a team so allergic to finishing",What happened to him?,More penetrative passes for sure.,,What was that. We got out played everywhere physically dominated embarrassin! Tuchel really needs to shake things up before WH half these players coasting!,"of course its done the chelsea way.. only showing some sense of urgency after being a goal down..

worst performance for 3pts ever.

and why did we spend 60+mil for a chilly replacement? we had emerson and alonso as benchers for chilly. cucurella's decent, but why spend so much when we literally have ben fucking chilwell???

i dare say we have the best wingbacks in the country and perhaps even in the world. 

i wanna support tuchel but i dont understand the fucking hesitancy in taking risks in attacks and always fielding players out of position. whats the point of having 300 corners in the game and 95% possession when we do absolutely nothing with it...",he looks to immediately pass it backwards. He and Cucurella were super poor today :/,Havertz can't play with his back to goal. Let Broja play in his place and let him take Mount's. Can't remember Mount even getting on the ball let alone doing something with it. Boy needs couple of weeks to get the engine started.,"Neither of their goals should of been allowed, first for the foul on Havertz and the second was the result of a corner that should of been changed to a FK after Cucu was given a hair cut. I'll take the point, I actually expected us to lose, frustrating","The moment our wing backs got the ball, there was no one to pass to. Mids are still way back, front 3 already near the center of the box"
134,"Gonna be honest here, I was one of those “xG” guys after Dortmund and was fully potter in because I truly saw some signs of improvement and thought that maybe that game could kickstart something. Clearly, I was wrong. That game was an outlier and we have regressed to the mean now. It’s getting harder and harder to defend Potter, but after seeing some of our abysmal performances I really don’t see how he’s going to turn it around.",I’ve been really critical of Kai lately but he was cooking tonight,Amazing how much more comfortable we look in a 3atb . Wingback FC should be here to stay imo. Reece and Chilly bombing down the wings is pretty much impossible to stop and with Felix and Enzo now in the side we should be able to utilise that space in the middle more. Still desperately missing a genuine goal scorer,Something has to change,"2 wins in 14, 4 goals in 2023. Not aloud to say anything negative though. Keep the hope and have patience! Boys tried hard!","I was expecting so much from this game

Havertz just did his best to dash all of that",Potter out,"Positive, our backline looks very decent.

Cucu had himself a shaky first 15, then he played his best match in blue.

Ziyech creates and work off the ball.

Mudryk will be an asset... omg.

Havertz had another great game (but still no goals..
)

Hall isnt built for this","Can someone help me understand what Potter is supposed to bring?

I haven’t seen a tactical/strategic improvement or identity. Our players haven’t been improving individually, they’ve actually gotten worse. So what does Potter bring?",The only thing that will make me happy is waking up to the news that potter is sacked,"The squad is rotten. It's the same old Chelsea performance. Bunch of players with no creativity. I said when we won the other day that we looked dead again when James went off, it's absolutely shocking how bad we look without him. 

Ziyech looked alright coming on, really wouldn't mind sterling warming the bench for a bit after that performance. Gallagher, oh boy, that was absolutely shocking. Not much else to say really, just same old!","Potter has managed us for 17 games.

We've won 3 were Kepa wasn't man of the match

We're one of the worst clubs in the league by every attacking metric.

The squad isn't good but it isn't this bad. he has to go.

It's like Watching Moyes at United again albeit Moyes is obviously a better and far more successful manager at Everton than Potter has ever been",I’d love to have a punt at Livramento. He left because Reece was in his way but surely he’d get a fair few minutes with Reece’s injury record. Plus Southampton might be going down and he might want to jump ship.,Our two only good players can't ever stay fit—Todd better be ready to spend,"So many years and windows of bad signings and being bailed out by world renowned managers. 

We look exposed right now. We don't have Tuchel to bail us out. If we remember, a lot of those Tuchel games were drawn out and side to side passing competitions, but they resulted in wins (the most important thing, yes). 

If we kept Tuchel (which I would have loved) we would have done the same thing of buying overrated players and having edged it out over the course of a season. 

The bold step to go with Potter as a long term option means we are going experience a lot of ups and downs. We started our first 8 really well, now our past 6/ 7 have been bad. Over the course of the next few windows and seasons, we are going to (hopefully) move on some of these awful signings and start building a proper team worthy of challenging for the title. 

Remember, since GP has come in, how many games have we played? How little time has he actually had to train these guys for more than a day at a time. We know what he can do and hopefully the owners stick with him and we can see the outcome","Pulisic noob. I hope the muricans stop saying he needs to start. Did fuck all, cant attack cant defend.","As soon as Lindelof came on, Broja should've been on. How did Potter miss that after doing such a fantastic job adjusting I have no idea","Brentford are a good side and credit to them for playing a good solid game. Think a draw is probably fair all in all and not the end of the world from our perspective. In terms of positives, Chukwuemeka looked really lively which is nice to see and I thought Pulisic looked something close to his best when he came on. Just wasn't to be today.

Edit: thought Kepa was good but MOTM probably over the top. Would have given it to Koulibaly personally.","We could (should) have won. 

Pulisic looked great. He needs to play more, get into rhythm, and then I think he finishes that. He has had some unbelievably composed and fantastic finishes in front of goal for us in the past. He is more than capable, but he needs playing time and a manager to give him a string of games to build up his confidence. He seems to have regained a bit of the explosiveness he had pre-hamny. 

Hall. Great game, young man. Would love to see more of him. 

Ziyech. I've been asking for a while why he doesn't play more. Yes. He had an absolute atrocious game 1-2 starts ago... arguably one of the worst performances I've ever seen. But his left foot is amazing and he is a line-busting magician at times and we could use that in the squad. 

I don't want to see Kai start for the rest of the season. Love the kid but he's not ready. There is zero reason to put him out there when we have all these other hungry players looking to make a name for themselves. Give ANY of them the same patience and grace that Kai has had and see what happens. 

Same for RLC.",I promise you that Potter does not give a fuck about Pulisic's world cup lol. Says a lot that this is him supposedly being in a good patch and he's still achieved almost no end product,"Slow, uninspired, indirect, visionless, and devoid of anything that resembles a goal threat. I watched all 90 minutes of it and I want my time back","shame Auba didn't take either of those chances, both were beautiful build up",Is that two league wins in a row?,"Great to see us putting in professional, comfortable performances again. Can’t remember the last time we won 3 on the bounce. Great day for the blues all round.","We have 15 shots but only 3 on target, what the fuck is wrong with these players","We looked good, but lets not hide the fact that Milan were absolutely toothless all game. They looked dreadful",Ability to look for and make higher risk balls. Actual throughballs through the middle of the pitch. I've said it before but Tuchel was so possesion focused and would go nuts if it was lost. Must be so freeing to be encouraged to take risks without the manager going ballistic on the touchline.,,When is pre season over? Looking forward to watching our team try and win games like points matter.,"Is there a worse gk in the prem than mendy or a worse athlete than jorginho. Our ability to play through the middle is a joke. All we can do is pass wide which is lovely when all our crosses beat the first man....

Spending 280 mil and having glaring issues in a few positions is almost funny.",Out of interest what did you want from him today in midfield?,"The game perfectly showcased all the good and bad in our team.

Thiago Silva and Reece James were amazing again, easily among our top 3 best players almost every game. Unfortunately Chalobah had a mixed game - didn't get punished for his awful positioning and marking because Vardy had a mare, but it was not a convincing performance by him. Awful individual error from Cucurella but he was good outside of that. We need to cut down these individual errors though, almost every game we concede it's from a boneheaded play and not the quality of our opponent.

Midfield was poor - Gallagher really screwed them over with his recklessness. Jorginho was decent, his errors in possession didn't get punished this time and he recylced possession well.  But Mount was entirely absent, and RLC had these flashes of great potential with no end product again. Seems to be the same thing wtih him, runs with the ball and then has absolutely no idea what to do with it. Imagine if Jorginho had RLC's body. 

Havertz was Havertz again - bringing good effort and time wasting but a complete lack of attacking quality again. Sterling was Sterling - relentlessly making runs and trying to create chances and this time being rewarded. 

Kovacic looked okay when he came on but really the subs weren't in a position to shine due to us being down to 10 men.

I'm still really nervous about the season ahead, I just don't see where goals are going to come from and our midfield seems incapable of protecting our backline, as well as all these individual mistakes...","Look we should have gotten the three points. We were better, had more chances, had better chances. I don’t know what else you want tuchel to do. 

Two massive errors by Anthony Taylor and a mistake by Jorginho. That’s what it all came down to.","Freezing our all the natural wide players to persist with three is going to cost us. We should have transition to a back 4 after his first half season. I believe the champions league win actually delayed that. Setting up to cover for thiago and jorginho is so short sighted, and it basically means every other player is put of position and form. Lukaku, zyech, pulicic, werner, and cho have all struggled. How long does the list need to be before tactics and coaching is looked at, how long before we add sterling to that list."
135,Potter out!!,"Sweet relief, the last 20 minutes were nerve wrecking, I'll remember this night for a long time to come 💙",We actually won a match guys,Potter has to go now,I miss Tuchel. I’ll leave it at that for the sake of positivity,"Playing like we have no manager.

Absolutely pathetic,The Chelsea Fan base is the most toxic of all. People are blaming Potter all the time.

But, he can't do that as a pivot because he is always concerned over his defensive duties. That's why more often than not he makes the safe pass.

The biggest thing I see is a complete lack of confidence in the attacking unit as a whole. Players look hesitant and desperate rather than composed - and the consistent lack of production from stars to subs reflects that.

TT can’t say he didn’t get most of what he wanted in this transfer window. If this group doesn’t start to gel soon, I think he has to look himself in the mirror and we need to stop focusing so much on individual performances.","We are, guaranteed top if Zagreb don't win later too.",Take the win of course but this squad is full of bang average players which will most likely take years to rebuild.

Glad for the 3 points against a solid defensive team however we need more urgency coming forward like we showed after antonio scored. It's a shame that we lack confidence in our attacking patterns because we are kept at knife edge especially against such a compact structure full of runners like west ham today. I thought fofana showed good intent today on his debut although his shot was horrible. Also kovacic was shaky today coming back - if we weren't so dodgy in mf he should be eased back in like chilwell and hopefully zakaria registration is sorted soon. Also great cameos by kai and ben.

Will point out, 60 minutes in at home and potter makes double sub to take off attackers and put on 2 defensive mids, or at least 1 defensive mid and 1 box to box, to have 4 CM/DMs on is fkn shocking....at home to fkn Leeds, jesus christ.

Need to now try and find 2 goals vs Dortmund now....here's to hoping!",This is not ok.. it’s straight up butchering the club I love,The PE teacher needs to fuck off,"Disappointing but expected. Still rebuilding. There are some glaring weaknesses in the team, namely Mount and Gallagher right now.","Awful/non-existent tactics, strange selections, substitutes with no impact and an utterly dull and uninspiring post match interview.

We would have lost 0-1 with somehow less attempts on goal,Anybody remember the terms of his loan and what the price was set at for his buy option?,How depressing was this,"Even if we were THIS bad under Tuchel, I'd still find some comfort in backing the manager that literally transformed us into European giants out of nowhere.  
This is just sad and just shows a club with no plan or direction.",Oh well that was horrible,Feels like a loss… what is it and United in the last 5 mins of a game.  Question for me is why have Cucu as LCB when it was an absolute failure last week … makes no sense. Casemiro … my hatred for this Cabbage patch kid looking mf knows no end.,"Havertz was poor today. Seems to be very careless with the ball and never fully in control of it.
Broja looked really bright and he caused them a lot of problems, shame he couldn't quite make the final pass or shot but if he keeps playing he'll be a starter for us for sure.
Subs all played well although not sure about Sterling at LWB, he doesn't have the defensive awareness for it but thats not his fault, he's a forward!
Ultimately a point away at Brentford, with this team put out isn't the worst result.

Also Kepa has really stepped up these last games, hopefully his crisp packet hands have been replaced!",And less fixtures available for Potter to show his tactical ineptitude,"Personally Boehly needs to get someone in to have a look at the physio's and trainers at Chelsea, something is terribly wrong.","A team with zero passion.

The only players that look up for the fight are James and Silva (Not tonight as he didn’t play). But they all lack passion and it seems like they’re a team of individuals. We thrive playing 5 at the back last season, some incredible football, but new signings and players out means the system has to change. We need to play to strengths and build together.

Massive lack of creativity too, unsure what Jorginho does when he’s on the pitch. But no creativity mean little chances. Really poor performance in an important CL game.",Yes we qualified,Kepa Conor and Auba showed why they should be starting,How was costa?

You can blame whoever you want for that, but I blame TT. Every descision he makes is an attempt to cover our weak midfield. If you really want to play 3-4-3 then fine but you need 1. A deep lying playmaker (not jorginho) some one who can playmake dah (ala fabregas, pirlo,..) and not be a lyability in defense, and 2. A ball winning midfielder (like kante but fit) preferably a tank, with big shoulders, to bully midfields.

We survived yesterday because it was deleted by the mods on time.,Havertz man.. what a performance. He lead the line better than Lukaku ever could. Incredible !,"We dicked spurs up and down for 90mins. Great performance and really should've had more goals.

Still should be a win if ref has eyes.","Is it time to pull a conte and swap formations? A refresh is needed. This formation has been found out since last season. If back 4 is the eventual goal it may be best to start moving towards this.

139,"You simply cannot be behind Potter. It's inexcusable. He's just out of his depth.

We should have capitalized with 3 points.","If all I need to do is to be a loser to be Chelsea manager, please employ me Mr Boehly.",Bad,I’m really worried about this new standard we’re settling for. That simply was not good enough. It says a lot that our only goal came from a massive stroke of luck. We shouldn’t be clinging on for a draw against teams like Nottingham Forest. Really poor.,"If we need a clean slate, we need to sell Havertz. He’s not a striker, and we keep playing with a shadow of a player thinking we have a striker. Sell him, play a proper striker, we have enough playmakers.",I'd say the rest helped a lot too.,"Thé différence in technical ability between our players and Arsenal’s was so shocking, we could barely string 4 passes together all game, our forwards lose possession every time they got on the ball, looked like a midtable team","I know that I can be a unwanted shining light of 'glass half full' (except when it comes to ref bias against us in the domestic cups) on this sub when everyone just wants to shit on Chelsea - buuut-

Are Chelsea bad right now? - ✅

Yup! We are boring, we can't score to save our lives. We can't take long shots. Our attackers can't beat their man 1 on 1. We keep trying to play from the back despite the obvious threat of a pressing high line whilst we have Mendy in goal - thus not playing with his weakness in mind. 

Is their legitimate reasons? - ✅

Yeah! Significant ones too!
Our fucking OWNER got unjustly ripped from us by an inept UK Government, due to a war in Europe that we somehow got roped into and blamed for, whilst being used as a scapegoat to make it look like the UK was helping Ukraine and cracking down on Russians- whether said Russians like Roman actively disagreed with the war or not. 
(Sidenote - still proud of Romans efforts during covid pandemic helping UK people + his efforts to attend and contribute to peace talks on behalf of Ukraine).
That got him replaced with the best of a bad bunch in Todd Bohley.

During the whole pre-mentioned situation, that process had our club fucking sanctioned, which made our Champions League/Club World Cup/Super Cup winning Manager Thomas Tuchel get burnt out by having to be our anti-war spokesman to the media, whilst dealing with a overload of games - because we got no assistance from the FA like other clubs when we had a large portion of players catch covid. (Even though other teams got matches delayed for just 1 covid positive case).

(Those sanctions also prevented Chelsea from resigning Rudiger, our second best Defender, who I believe brought a significant fight and chaos that the team needed and thrived on. To a lesser extent we also lost Christensen, so at least we save some money budget on toilet roll.
The sanctions also explain why we were late to the transfer market, because we weren't legally allowed to contact players or do deals untill it was all over - which everyone forgets/pretends isn't the reason why all our new players have such gigantic price tags on their heads - all clubs knew we were desperate/setup to fail without the new players and they milked us for them). 

Then we had the stupid US tour which burnt Tuchel out even more.  Rather than getting support from our new owner in Tuchels first bad patch. He was stupid enough to actually sack TT. Which has pretty much ripped the spirit out of a lot of the fans (myself included). 

INJURIES-  Can't skip the fact that the players who are injured, just so happen to be our best.

N'Golo Kante! Reece James! Ben Chilwell! 
Those are our UCL winning starters right there.
+ for added bonus new signing Fofana + God Form Kepa + RLC? 

I would say T.Silva is the only 'best player' that we have who is still fully fit. 

Conclusion  - 
We've gone through more insane shit than any other team could possibly imagine, we lost our owner, our manager and most of our best players.

People should not be suprised that we aren't doing very well. 



The positive outlook - WE HAVE WITNESSED CHELSEA WIN EVERYTHING THAT COULD EVER BE WON!
EVERYTHING!!!!

Some fans of other teams have never seen their team win anything ever. 

We just have to accept that it's our turn to get kicked around for awhile and hope that it doesn't last too long. 
Our club got gutted and was dieing on the floor only a few months ago. Chelsea will bounce back at some point but it won't be for awhile.","Not gonna overreact but hopefully Potter learns from this game, back three without proper wingbacks just doesn’t work.

Seems he’s chopped opposition 18yard box now too.",So who else is a temporary Arsenal fan tomorrow?,I think we lacked energy. Mount was playing his 4th or 5th game in a row and he was still the best.,[removed],These fucking idiots on TV giving Tottenham credit for not losing like they outplayed us at any point in this game. This whole shit is a reality show,"Chelsea should just stick players to their natural position, 
James has to play at wing-back, if he plays CB we don't have attack on the right side. Havertz has a talent, but not for false 9, needs to play true striker upfront or we just spam cross for nothing.

Chelsea nature it's to have proper DM/B2B midfielders, we have essien, ramires, matic, kante. and now we see if kante not playing, our midfield can't handle press. Cucu apart from his directness play, he can't shot like Alonso or Chilwell for winning a goal, he need to step up his shooting aim, I can't believe I'd rather start Alonso at this point, he definitely has goal threat than our forwards."
140,"There's definitely some tension in the squad.. Felix doesn't pass to Sterling. Mudryk doesn't pass to Cucu and vice versa. Maybe nationality clashes, but damn were definitely just a group of individuals trying to get a result.. There are groups within the dressing room which are probably why there is no cohesion to the team. 

A strong manager would break all these when he walks in, but this is just beyond saving. Potter walked into a minefield and it blew up into his face.

I’ve watched relegation level teams play with more heart. 

Fuck the tactics there’s no tactic that saves a team like this","If the idea is to actually rebuild and results don’t matter, then play more youth like Frank did. Don’t see why we’re trodding out the same players expecting something to change. If the manager can’t get these players to click, play Hutchinson, play Chalobah (should be playing anyway), play Carney before the 87th minute, and move on from the players that don’t want to be here. 

Need a midfielder, a RB, and a defender badly. Koulibaly is past it, Azpi’s legs can’t have him playing the Reece role of being in the final third and sprint back to defend.
No idea why Zakaria played as the furthest midfield up at times, took him away from the middle of the pitch where we desperately need another outlet. Mount was very poor, Havertz didn’t even complete a dribble. Just really, really bad team selection. We beat Bournemouth but similarly they played themselves back  into the game and Kepa saved us, this game it looked like we could’ve conceded more as well.","Ziyech is so frustrating. Has ZERO hustle. He’ll lose the ball and make NO attempt to win it back and just meanders around like he doesn’t have to do anything. He gave the ball away so many times tonight, just get rid of him as soon as possible.","World Cup, rest and seems like some new tactics from Potter. He seemed to be conservative in team selection and tactics trying to have a soft transition over from Tuchel. I hope the fans let him try out his tactics before calling for his sacking for every small negative thing that happens at the club. Clearly the new owners and players are totally fine with Potter but some fans with a Tuchel hangover will just hate on him for no reason.","A football team with no identify, no belief, and no direction.

If this continues, we will not even reach Europa League. I’m sad to admit that we do in fact play anti-football, but with very little end product relying entirely on our wing-backs with a toothless set of attackers and a weak midfield.","Pulisic will start next game for sure. I could see mount as 10, Broja as 9, and Gallagher on the right","Today Chaos FC reigns victorious against the Charity FC.

Charity FC tried so hard tho.",Spurs did not get one yellow other than Conte in that entire game. Tell me that is not biased after how that game went.,"i think not using a top 3 is hindering the attack a lot. problem is the wingers we’ve got really aren’t respected on the dribble, Sterling aside bc he hasn’t been playing wide much… guys like ASM, Zaha, Foden would make a huge difference in the oppositions entire defensive strategy. Unfortunately Havertz is not known for his silky dribbling.

Reece at RWB and Cucu as LWB is an okay way to compensate for the lack of wingers but they’re crossing it to Sterling.."

Not sure what else people need to see to understand it is a coaching problem. Either Potter is incapable of putting together a winning plan and communicating it effectively to the players, or they're simply not buying what he's selling. Neither are a good look.",Why is Potter smiling in the interview? Lol. I would be embarrassed in this position.,"We scored, could had few more, West Ham showed we have a soft underbelly from set pieces, didn't help ourselves though.

Players like Ziyech need to be far away from this squad now, he has no life here beyond the summer so why even give him time? He gives away fouls after fouls with lazy defending, always pulling at a shirt when a guy walks past him etc and could have cost us points this game. 

Subs today were diabloical, how on earth u taking off both wingers to bring on Ziyech who doesn't want to be here and isn't good enough for how we want to play and then Noni off for Mount, who made few good runs and nearly squared a tap in for Kai, but still both those going off really messed us up.

Keeping Lofty on for that long was also criminal, the guy is not a top player, if he is happy to be a squad player then keep him around, but he shouldn't be starting, he does everything in his power to not pass the ball to a team mate and looks like he walks around the pitch. 

Cucurella poor guy needs Sancho treatment, get him out of the squad, let him relax and build himself up for some apperances in April or something. Hall and Chilwell is enough going forward now.

Outside of that we played well though, some exceptional attacking moments with player still finding there feet, something is growing we just need a bit of patience and Potter needs to stop ""keeping people happy"" and start taking them out of the team.

Lofty cameo today is just so weird, Deniz Kovacic and Kante all coming back soon, Lofty aint never getting in after they return for example, so why even play him lol.","I, for one, am excited to see us revert back to pass to LW and hope for a miracle.","No improvements, other than Felix looking dangerous....oh and Potter glow up jacket.","I think it's obvious, guys: these players ain't playing for Potter.

The unnecessary sacking of Tuchel, the mediocre signings (Cucurella, Koulibaly, Aubameyang), the lack of a clear tactic plan from the coach and the players seemingly having already checked out mentaly from this season. Maybe the new players haven't shined yet because the team hasn't done so, but with Sterling you can see the team is holding him back, with the others I don't think so. Potter hasn't done anything to improve cohesion and build-up play in this team, I'd go as far as saying that he doesn't have an idea of how he wants us to play.  With how things look like right now, we'd be lucky to get top-6 this season, I don't want to even think about Champions League because we have to solve other foundational issues first.",[removed],CAAAAREFREE WHEREVER WE MAY BE,"Our summer signings letting us down, think we’ll look back at this window and talk about how much we spent on medicore players",Has anyone done a chant of “Kepa Arrizabalaga” to the tune of “if you like pina coladas” yet,[deleted],He’s played 418 minutes out of a possible 1080 in the PL.,Mount isn't playing in the world cup if he doesn't improve fast.,I was so angry at the Salzburg player for that.

Bring on Dortmund","This was hideous. We just lost to the bottom of the league with an interim coach at home. Chelsea is unrecognizable. No aggression, no pride, and no strategy. I want to believe in the “project” but I am officially “Potter OUT”. Great coaches make a difference (i.e. Eddie Howe & Sean Dyche) with limited time/tools while world-class coaches make something out of nothing (i.e. Tuchel CL win). With Potter, there’s no improvement in any aspect of our play after 600m in signings plus 6 months at the helm. Potter had plenty of time with World Cup break, depth in every position, and nothing.

We played well tbh",My only consolation is that Arteta got 3 years to build their squad. Dont know if I have that much hope in Potter though......,Potter is awful,"Been really impressed by the performance of the lads today. We're actually starting to look like a team rather than a group of talented individuals.

I have had my reservations about Potters style of play but now I'm starting to see flashes of the old Chelsea. Mudryk and Badiashile look set to fill the hole in my heart that Hazard and Rudi left and I can't wait to see how they will develop over the course of their career for us. 

Even players like Ziyech and Havertz that I'd mentally written off, are now looking like they might actually have a place in our team moving forward. 

As much as I miss Tuchel, I think by the end of his time here he had lost the support of the players, and when that happens there's not much you can do other than appoint a new manager and it looks like the lads are ready to give it all for Potters system.","Honestly gone past being angry or sad, now it's kind of funny the bad luck we're getting. It's got to change at some point. Right!?",We’re gonna be man utd no2 after they lost sir alex aren’t we,"We’re in a seriously bad place at the moment.

Graham potter somehow manages to really turn the entire team off with his pep talk in the half time.","Yeah we needed to control the game in the second half with a midfield change but the profile of midfielders we had couldn’t really do that. Kova and RLC would’ve helped in that regard. 

Best option was to go back 5","Only 1 shot on target at home, against our rivals Arsenal of all team. Why do the club pay those high wages to them again?

Tbh I am not mad at Gallagher. He played well for the minutes he was in. The first yellow was too easy while the 2nd was deserved. Cucu did him dirty there, so he had to try to win it. Maybe in his head he was the last man in defence. Definitely a situation I expect most of the youngsters to fail. Cheer up boys, this comes with time.

Great character shown is what matters.","Fuck Anthony Taylor. But at the end of the day we cannot waste 100 opportunities in the opposition box. Kai, Sterling, Gallagher all guilty.

Offered nothing to the midfield all game,My patience with potter is growing thin I am not potter out but at some point he needs to show us what the team is capable of,"Badiashile looks to be class back there. Calm, good on the ball and physically very capable as well. Mudryk looked electric but he’s still very raw. Overall not a bad result and hopefully that injury to Trev isn’t serious.","That entire back line, Silva aside, were WOEFUL. Granted that’s not Hall’s best position but KK/Trevor/Azpi, my word. Breathtakingly bad. Kepa…what the fuck?",I’m here for the scenes,"We looked ass even after the break.

Its not looking good for our top 4 race. Its intriguing to see how patience Boehly will be","Hard to overstate how disappointed I am with Aubameyang. I never want to see him in a Chelsea shirt again. I would make Aubameyang train alone and sell him at the first opportunity after tonight. Disgraceful! I'm really pleased Potter took him off. Ziyech showed why he doesn't play and should be sold.

Despite a disappointing result, the new injuries and 1 or 2 extremely disappointing performances, I feel better about our prospects than before. I was very impressed at the youngsters and newcomers today. Zakaria also excellent. It feels like there is the beginning of a real team here, but my god do we need to get rid of the stragglers.","Cucurella and K2 were fine today, probably their best game in a while tbh.",Villa just created a goal that we wouldn’t be able to if we played for 10 hrs,"For those of you genuinely asking for Potter to be sacked, it’s not like we were looking great under Tuchel ffs. These results are a product of years of turbulence. Look at what Arsenal has been able to achieve with some stability and long-term vision over a few bumpy seasons. Give it time or we’ll be stuck with this forever","A team without balls, first of all. Having Reece injured we don't have a single player who can step up when things are going south. That's one thing compared to Liverpool and City these players never had, balls.","Chalobah with his beat performance for us today!

The only problem is I don't think he believes in himself being a higher level of player.

Also, can I mention how great Jorgi's been lately. Man has gotten even better at interceptions, actually has been playing like a proper DM instead of his normal regista style.",Great game what would you guys say our formation was?,Armando Broja’s goal was the peak moment today - a quality academy player - lives and breathes the club.

Just hope  from next game he skips the first half level and starts at the second half level from the get go.

Kai was very good, I don't see Aubameyang doing anything Kai does, not saying not scoring goals is great but the way Kai is holding off defenders and linking play like a target man, I just don't see how Auba fits that gane plan.


RLC was good too, had few lapses in choosing passes but great work out there.

Cucu was very good today. Azpi did well after coming on. Reece was Reece.

Mount has been a ghost, needs to get in form fast.

Mendy saved so much, he has donre some big mistakes lately but man saved our ass today.

Chalo did okay, still could cut errors a bit but today showed the reason we need him with so many games.

Jorgi has had a great start to the season apart from that error.

Gallagher man you need to be calm and more mature. You were having an okay game today but now the dumb reaction is the talk.

It’s too early to say but against weaker teams (the majority of teams we play) potter ball is proving to be the answer. Tuchel always set us up amazingly in the big games so that will be the test","feel like Broja should be starting or at least deserves a start soon, immediately showed hunger and a willingness to chase balls down and hound the opposition.",Unbelievable tonight,"Mount's change of pace is kind of special you see. At one point he might seem slow but in the next 5 seconds he will go in a physical battle with a defender, use his body while his back is facing the goal, turn around with the ball and accelerate at top speed instantly and deliver a killer shot or killer cross.",,"Where do we even go from here? Our midfield is ass without Kante but I don’t even know if signing a DM fixes our problems. Team acts like they’ve never played with each other before.

I have limited knowledge but I feel like it's the midfield, as in we have no midfield outside of Kovacic and Kante and neither can stay healthy. It's going to be a tough ask to secure top 4 with such an average midfield. Hopefully the defence which seems strong will get us through if Sterling at least can keep playing well. I don't want to be lumped in with the clowns around here please. I am not shitting on our players just for the sake of it, I am not saying Tuchel out or we're getting relegated or anything of the sort, I just really don't feel confident in much right now but I'll support this club til I die.","12 v 11 today. We played very well. 

Disappointed with result but proud of the performance.","We are a good defensive team, but we play a possession based game. When mistakes happen, the ball is so close to our goal that’s it’s always a chance for the other team. We need a counter attacking style, get back to our identity. That’s how we won: defense and lightning counters. We are not capable at possessive attack, we know that so far."
152,What in the fuck did these owners base their decision to hire Potter on? I’m so baffled by it all. Was it the fact he couldn’t get his Brighton side to score goals either?,"What a fantastic win! We were by far the better team, we might not have had possession as much as we wanted, but we had by far the better chances. We were still a bit shaky defending the result at the end there, but it's normal considering we are a team in transition. All in all great win against a good team in form.

Otherwise a decent performance with the back 3.",Sorry Potter can’t defend you anymore mate……. This is a must win match….,"Werner my sweet prince I miss you. You had a 10% conversion rate but atleast you converted after 9 tries, or the lucky rebound would fall fortunately to someone.","If mount and Mudryk are playing together, gotta line up Mount on the opposite side. Mount so far up the pitch and occupying the spaces that Mudryk would be good in.

Players need to pass the ball to Enzo more. All we do is pass in a U shape from fullback to fullback and the lone times we look dangerous is when we play up the middle. 

Ultimately, it’ll come down to Potter doing something about this. I don’t know what his fix is since we’re playing his tactics. Fullbacks and wingers know the sideline isolated from everyone and playing the ball to them just to pass the ball back. I don’t see what the plan is.

I think Sterling was about on par with Havertz. And really that isn't saying much because none of those 3 played well.","Well done to the team for resilient performance.
Needed a lot bit of luck to get a result after going 1 man down.

But Tuchel needs to do players a little favour by playing them at their positions.
I am feeling bad for Gallagher people are already starting to bash him even though Tuchel is playing him alongside Jorginho which is a little surprising because RLC can play a holding role better than Gallagher but RLC's finishing is awful and his vision is average.

On the other hand, Gallagher can shoot better and has better vision than RLC I watched Gallagher quite a lot last season he was so good for them.

The likes of chalobah, gallagher, mount, havertz, Ziyech all can't beat their man when in possession and under pressure, so their instinct is always to pass backwards. Look at City players. They are all hovering over the ball baiting our players to press, before they comfortably pass to another player in space.

Why when a team plays a low block do we become peak Southgate England by creating a massive square with nothing going on in the middle.

We play wide wing backs and use them to get into a crossing position but don’t have anyone who can header to get on the end of them.
If we’re going to play with crossing wing backs then we need to have Broja or an actual striker up top.

If we’re going to play with the team we started with them the top line needs to be more fluid. Why is Havertz as a false nine not dropping into space to pull defenders out of position? He’s not a striker no he can’t lead the line like one either.

We were just let down by the finishing and thats an individual error/mentality thing.

Some complaints about the subs were seen but we dominated the match to the same level before and after so I think Potter was fine with that too.

I genuinely had a Ratatouille flashback during the close dribbling he did in the \~63rd minute.

Ugly win, but a win nonetheless",[deleted],Played well with 10 men but if we play like that against City or Liverpool we will get hammered. Tuchel is going to have to improve these tactics as soon as possible.,"We played great, dominated the game, and fucking Anthony Taylor lets Romero bulldoze his way through our team and practically hands them two goals. Sickening.","A priority for next year needs to be better planning around our pre-season. We will certainly go on another tour since Boehly needs the money printer to go brrrrr, but look at how poor our US-tour turned out. In our game against Arsenal they played the exact XI they have used for every game so far. We gave minutes to Werner, Sarr, Alonso, Batshuayi while Gilmour wasn't even part of the squad.   
   
I think we'll be fine for Leicester, but today we showed that preparation so far have been poor."
156,Keep making jokes fucking clown (potter).,EVERYBODY CLAP YOUR HANDS!,Watching 2 minutes of the Arsenal game was more exciting than any Chelsea game I’ve seen under Potter.,"even shitty teams can score, this performance was embarrassing, I think that Potter runout of time to show what he can do with our squad","This team is a walking ghost. 

A walking fucking GHOST.",Badiashile has settled really well,CFC stands for cursed football club,That mudryk dribble before he hit the side of the net gave me hazard vibes,"We lose every week, we lose every week

You're nothing special

We lose every week

Our chant the next few games","I’m glad I went out and had a good Sunday instead of watching this match. I’m finding myself uninterested in Chelsea matches lately. Still a fan but with all the injuries and the way we play, I’m just not entertained, and that’s really the point of sport no?","Got cut our loses with some of these players, Havertz isn’t up to the PL spec. KK either. 

Auba biggest strength was his pace, he’s the wrong side of 30 for that. 

Azpi has been run into the ground, legend of the club but can’t keep up with the pace now. 

Gallagher isn’t Chelsea quality (yet maybe?) 

Ziyech not consistent enough, doesn’t get consistent game time which doesn’t help his cause.",Everyone happy with the atmosphere tonight? Hopefully it came out loud enough through everyone's speakers?,Peanut butter and gasoline.,"I’m saying this for the millionth time but the midfield is the heart of a team and ours is dreadful. We have a bunch of pressing 8s and no true 6 who can play in this league. Jorginho and Kante are not what they were 2-3 years ago, Kovacic is over used and RLC does not play that naturally. Until we invest in that part of the team we will struggle with any team in the top6 because they have better midfields","I'm not a fan of pinning the blame on the manager, nor am I comparing Potter to Tuchel, but does anyone think we look good under Potter? Bar the 3-0 against Wolves and the wins against AC Milan, we've consistently looked shaky if I'm being kind.

I have no problem in giving Potter time and ""trusting the process"", but on what basis? We've been horrendously unstable defensively, our finishing is shite, our build-up play more often than not is non-existent. There isn't one phase of play where you can point to and say, ""Look, this is where the improvements are coming, now give him time to work on the other stuff.""

Granted, we have had injuries to key players, but is our squad bad enough to lose 4-1 to Brighton (no disrespect)? I don't think so.

I don't know, maybe I'm too emotionally charged up right now look at this straight, but we've looked poor throughout this season, and it fucking hurts. 8th is NOT where we should be in the league.",Gonna start to get use to watching Thursday night football if we're lucky,"I will start by saying that I feel the recent performances against United, Brentford and Villa have been poor. We’ve looked devoid of ideas in attack, poor in midfield and we’ve been lucky to concede 1 across those 3 games.

However, the level of negativity aimed at Potter is absolutely insane. The guy has been here 5 minutes and is using the EXACT SAME group of players who underperformed for Tuchel, plus he’s had no transfer window to bring in players he specifically wants to fit his specific way of playing. 

Let’s put it this way…
- Potter can’t suddenly make Reece James less injury prone
- Potter can’t suddenly sign an able deputy at RB/RWB to step in when James is injured
- Potter can’t suddenly give Azpilicueta and Jorginho pace
- Potter can’t suddenly make Kovacic less injury prone
- Potter can’t de-age Aubameyang
- Potter can’t suddenly make our wingers prolific goal scorers, when both Lampard and Tuchel failed to do so

The list could go on but my point is that Potter has been here for 5 minutes and has inherited what he has inherited. Compared to other elite sides, we have a deeply flawed squad with obvious jokes and clear issues. However, we have not lost a game since he joined and considering the level of performance earlier in the season under Tuchel, I’d call the current situation an improvement. Moreover, he’s actually trusting younger players in big games and with real minutes which is a pleasant change from previous coaches.

I don’t think it’s fair to judge Potter until he’s had at least 12 months as well as a window (or two) to address key deficiencies in our squad… deficiencies that we fans have known about for years but deficiencies that haven’t been addressed for years.

Let’s try and be positive yeah?","Kepa played great again today.

Puli came in from the bench and was our best player offensively (with only Broja coming close imo), basically controlled every major attempt from the 60th minute onwards, but had little to no support (or Brentford came up with a big save/block).","Ziyech played well? Are you kidding me? 
Pulisic has become a dribble merchant recently, just no awareness or selfishness on his part he doesn't pass.",Away goals scored.,"I was a huge fan of Tuchel since he came in and won us the UCL, but I can't defend him anymore. Either he improves our playstyle, or starts grinding results while playing whatever style of football this is. If nothing improves then he's gone at the end of this season after being backed with 300M in signings.",Lmao power went out at my house and my phone died so I missed everything after Salzburg equalized,[deleted],His press along with Mount's has been immense today and we still have Kanté coming back,"First game I've been able to watch for a while, and even though it was a disappointing result, I don't get the overwhelming negativity in this sub, enjoyed watching it: I think alot of the toxicity here feeds off itself.",Lmaoo,Leao being the only player who did anything of note for them over two legs?,,"Too many people here complaining about the back 4 and Mount’s and Havertz play today. Prior to the first Southhampton goal we were knocking on the door for a good 10 minutes and both Mount and Havertz looked way better. Especially with Mount in  the midfield. Afterwards we completely disappeared in the first half and in the second we didn’t do anytning. 

We look better in a back 4 going forward but defensively its tough. James needs to be in place in front of Azpi. He just cant play RB/RWB. 4-3-3 just makes more sense for our personel minus J5. It lets Mount play in his preferred midfield position and allows Ziyech/Pulisic to push for gametime which lets us see which one we should keep.","Time to drop Mendy and also i wish for this lineup honestly

I'm not sad because we won but I'm definitily not happy after this","I am in the ‘potter out’ gang now. There were injuries, players were out, there can be bad form but…but I expect him to beat Southampton and West ham. An interim coach who has never coached will win games potter is not winning now. 

This guy knows Todd got his back. I wish he was on fire knowing that if he lost games like Southampton, he’d be axed","Instead of trying to buy every expensive young midfielder in the world, maybe focus on getting a legit striker.

Boehly masterclass.,"Anyone who is negative after that performance needs there head looking at. From what we have seen vs the likes of Forest and the shite this season, this clearly shows stepping stones. Lots of times today we looked the better team away at Anfield, regardless of the form Liverpool are in, we and them missing players and we looked good away at Anfield in lots of spells. 

Mudryk nice cameo from him looking nice and sharp on the ball and beautiful quick feet. Kai looked good today again which is nice. Wish Mount stayed on instead of Connor but u can understand why as he wanted Carney to play as 10 and Mount i doubt can play as 6. 

Still lots of positives in that performance, we looked a lot better, still work to do of course, but there was a clear plan it seemed from Potter and the team responded to that and put in a good performance, we should have won imo, had the better chances, Zyiech just cant score for us it seems and everyone who gets near a shooting chance slips over lol.

Our season starts now!",Only one thing left to do bring big sam to save us from relegation,was Mount playing?,Uninspiring football for most of the match.

If we are serious we need to look internally at our squad first,"that went about as expected. better performance, zak is good. onto the cup, up the chels","Forgot how horrible some of these takes were. We looked great in the first half. Very curious how that translates to clueless in attack. Had 2 goals, should’ve had a PK, and should’ve had a 3rd goal from Puli if it weren’t for a horrible call from the ref.

You could see that everyone had a clear role and it looked they knew their role and stuck to it very well. Excellent subs by Potter. 

Was great seeing Chelsea players being ready for the fight and getting stuck in. They looked not only determined and they seemed hell bent on showing it to Dortmund. Chelsea players are clearly playing for Potter. They respect and like him. It showed on the pitch and after the final whistle too. 

Also, great to see all the smiles and wide grins back on our players’ faces and to see Potter showing some emotions :)

Chelsea, who are in their worst in years, have beaten Dortmund who are on a 10-match winning run, after losing the first leg, by keeping a clean sheet. You just can’t overstate this achievement under the circumstances. 

We are well and truly cooking.","A win after so long, still so unsatisfying",2 in 15. Any other big club with this amount spent and talent is sacking the manager. Unacceptable defeat this was a must win at home.,Havertz needs to be benched asap,"Mount is shit and should be sold, same goes for Gallagher","Guys, you have to understand football is not football manager or FIFA. We have changed half our starting XI and things take time. If the performances, i'm not even talking about results don't change, then we can start talking about a change. Believe in the team and let's evaluate at the end of the season.","I think in general our back lined looked pretty good for the most part, Cucurella missed some passes but had some big actions in defence that stop Salah and co. Badiashile looked very solid, Thiago as always and Chalobah did quietly well. 

It's the midfield that let us down, it wasn't the worst but most of Liverpools chances came on the turnover and it was because our players were getting caught out too far up the pitch rather than offloading it to the attackers, at least when the attackers lose it then there's anther body or two before Liverpool hit our defence. 

Mudryk looked very good imo, if that's what he's doing after 2 months of no football then fuck that's a promising signing.","""Im rapidly falling out of love with football. I just wonder what's the point anymore you know""","Disagree with those ratings, Lewis Hall made a few mistakes but made up for it with some good interceptions, passes and runs. Hutchinson didn't look like he could pass wind nevermind the ball.

How Jorginho continues to feature is also beyond me. I guess Zakaria needed a rest today but no way Jorgi can be a regular at the moment.

At least Humphreys and Fofana looked decent. I don't know who cam eup with those ratings but Fofana looked a lot better than Havertz up front.

Also I get we need players in a lot of poisitons but our lack of a proper back-up to Reece was more obvious than ever today. Azpi is not good enough going forward to be a WB now, and Gallagher was clearly uncomfortable playing there.

Whole squad needs a rebuild at this point.","Such a shit unbalance team we have. 

Koulibaly, Sterling, Azpi, Havertz, and Gallagher were shockingly bad. 

It's the same textbook performance I am seeing week in and week out. 
Keep the possession between defenders (only when other teams let you have it) and when they start pressing we then crumbled and start hooping the ball. 

It's like watching Mourinho park the bus tactics without an attacking purpose. 

Kovacic when coming on you can clearly see the difference between a WC midfielder and an poor midfielder. 

I just hope we don't give any new contracts to Jorginho and instead. 

And also should have sold Gallagher in the summer when he had a good value. 

As for azpi, he is finished. 
Needs an Rb asap. 

If we get Enzo and an RB in January, then I can think we will be good to go for a CL and have a go for a top 4 (which I think we will not finish in the top 4)","All and all I am not mad at the result the young guys looked awesome out there, we should use, Hutch, Carney and Hall more we looked so lively when they came on",Have you been a Chelsea fans for three months only?,You could bring in Pep and Klopp to co-manage this team and they still wouldn't be able to do much better than Potter is with this island of misfit toys.  We desperately need to sell off all the dross and refresh the midfield.,Boehly has to call Tuchel from his India vacation double his wages and bring him back,"Why was Kepa subbed off? He couldn’t do anything about those goals, was he injured? I couldn’t watch the match",our players got rinsed all game,"\+, Kepa, Broja, Pulisic

\-, RLC, Havertz",Comical at times how the ball would not go in the net!,Chilwell,"Excellent pressing performance from our great pressing forwards. Why need forwards who can put it in the back of the net when you can rely on your defenders to whip something up!

Havertz really ghosts through the game, 0 creativity and 0 ability to  beat a man. If he has to smash it across the goal or tap it in then I guess he's useful.Mount was poor too offered nothing from what I've seen him produce in the past. He has to get it together.

Ziyech completely dreadful, where were the people who thought signing Raphina would be bad?

Fofana cost us the game unfortunately, his positioning was atrocious (shown it multiple times at Leicester), and couldn't use his pace to recover. Us going down in a game is a death sentence, we're never breaking a team down who parks the bus.

Getting rid of Werner was a terrible decision by the board. He offered so much more than any of our forwards. He created opportunity and chances. Without him it all feels  sterile.

And finally, this team cannot function without Kante. Get him fit and play him gently. Don't partner him with J5 so he can tear through his hamstrings covering the entire pitch again.",I  petition that we permanently make him watch matches with no wifi,The best thing about this match for me was the cinnamon roll I had then Gallagher banged that one in and my mood improved.,There will be plenty of people to find something to bitch about unfortunately,"Tonight was the first time Thiago Silva showed his age, he committed to that tackle because he knew he wouldn't be able to keep up with Adamu..but it's not on him that we didn't get the win tonight, we should have been able to find a 2nd goal against a team with only one first choice center back available..",It’s his (kepas) to lose I think so let’s see. I’m actually contemplating bringing him into my fantasy team this weekend,Mate he was in for about 10 mins when the game was completely dead.,,Leeds and Southampton were both simply more physically intense than us it seemed. Bizarre,Tuchel need to be drop.,"Yeah he was probably better than Frankfurt, the fact that people are (rightfully) calling him MOTM when Mount got two goals says it all really","Connor Gallagher is a hot, hot mess. I have seen none of the brilliance he displayed at CP last year. He is trying WAY too hard to impress and instead ends up looking like he should be sent out on loan again, if any other team would even take him.","And with that, the shit from Spurs is my most hated team again.",Does anyone know the song played by Leeds United at the end of the game?
159,Can’t wait for the presser.,"Potter bought himself a few more games. Hopefully he sticks to this 3atb and we get no injuries to chilwell/James.

Overall great performance, everyone fought hard. That said, I'm still not liking how Potter goes defensive subs to defend the lead yet again. I prefer us to defend by having possession, rather than ceding control and inviting them to attack.","People are upset over winning, fanbase here is so toxic right now.",I’m still unsure how it’s ends 11v11 with the same ref that sent off Felix for much much less. How does the premier league not do anything about it? Unless mourinho was right about there being a bias.,"Kai Havertz doesn't deserve a 4th season at Chelsea next season. Nothing about his performance today had anything to do with his position. It had everything to do with his lack of individual quality. Inability to run with the ball, lack of pace, poor decision making. Playing the game much slower than his teammates. Killing our counter attacks. Not able to set his feet, can't collect the ball, runs into defenders because he can't read danger or lack of scoring opportunities. None of that is rectified by playing him in his alleged proper role as a no.10. He would just do it in a different role.","If Mudryk was injured at half time why not replacing him with Sterling? Bringing on Madueke but playing him on the wrong side just baffling. Also Enzo was man-marked heavily during the first half, why didn’t we have another midfielder dropping deep to help with the build up? Cucurella was struggling clearly by the 50th minute again the substitution was a little too late. I’m down to supporting the manager but we’ve got to see progress with his selections and in-game management","Havertz silky army taking out all the stops to defend their knight in shining armour. 

He's been so poor, and should be miles away from  a starting line up. He really offered nothing this entire game (like every other). He  drops deep thinking he's Firmino/Odegaard but he has no vision or passing ability. When he has to carry the ball his dribbling is stiff. We need a striker running in behind and occupying the West Ham CBs so Felix/Mudryck/Noni have space to work.

Havertz has 5 goals in 21 games. He's awful. All his goals are tap ins or headers as well, he really offers nothing. For someone with apparent play making  ability, he has 1 assist. People need to stop pretending he has this creative ability and get their head out the ground.","That was our game without a doubt.

This team is allergic to making the right decisions sometimes. It is fucking shocking how bad the decision-making is. Gallagher needs to learn to pass the ball without taking 5 touches, Havertz, Mount, and Chuk have all been guilty of not pulling the trigger with clear chances. What a waste of a fucking game that was so clearly there to be won. I usually find myself complaining mainly when we concede, but in this match I found myself complaining mostly due to the players holding the ball for too long and not just strike it

On the positive side, we looked better than our fellow mid-table team. Defensively we were so solid and Badiashile has been a class above. Mudryk looks incredible. So quick, his dribbling was perfect, his passing was great, and he never looked to be stressed by the press. Added another level to our attack. Havertz had a good game too and was half a foot offside in the goal. Silva is Silva, faultless. Cucu was solid too against Salah of all players.

Two weeks rest now and hopefully some injured players back. Onwards and upwards.",I remember thinking how great it was that Boehly got rid of nearly all the deadwood in the squad this past summer. Now it feels like there is more than there ever has before. Not sure I’ve ever felt worse about a Chelsea squad since I’ve been a fan.,"No need discussing the game! What did you guys think of Fofana, the short time he was on? I liked him...","Honest take for us?

**This game -** we should've put the game to bed in the first half when Forest were sitting in deep and trying to hit us on the counter. I know we looked fairly comfortable which meant there wasn't a huge amount of urgency required but it's another example of a team coming back into the game and us dropping points.

The amount of comments that always appear to single out Mount is unbelievably confusing and frustrating. I've probably got a little bit of bias involved but am more than happy to admit that he wasn't at the races today and hasn't been for some games this season.

That being said, there's clearly 4+ players every game where we struggle that are just as *meh* as Mase can be in games but they get far less criticism aimed their way. If that's because we expect more from Mount then fair enough, but you can't be all for criticising him when he doesn't perform and then say nothing when he's outstanding for us. It doesn't work that way.

**This season -** people are quick to forget that we had a change of ownership in the summer which meant that the structure behind the scenes changed. It's not business as usual in that regard. Potter came into the club at the start of September, after the transfer window had closed, and we're expecting him to have done far more than Tuchel with the exact same squad? How? He's alright but he's not a magician!

We had okay squad depth but it's becoming evident that the talent doesn't descend through the levels. That's clear as day when James and Chilwell are out and Azpi and Cucurella just aren't up to the task. Havertz blows hot and cold with Auba clearly not being up to the task. Jorginho is okay in phases and Kovacic can't cover two positions to make up for him.

This season was only ever going to be a transitional season with the stuff the club has gone through in the summer and the months leading up to that. People need to temper their expectations that we were unlikely to be fully comfortable and as a result we might be struggling further down the table. That's even with spending how much money we did - this isn't really like Football Manager where you can fork out for half a new squad and expect them to work perfectly after a few weeks.","A loos but a good performance against the odds. The young lads were brilliant, Hall in particular shone. I'd like to see a young line up against City Sunday. They can't do any worse and on the basis of tonight they will do better.",We just won wtf?,"You guys realise James,chilwell kovacic fofana koulibally kante would start if fit","Atleast Boehly will have a manager he can talk to, that is enough to win matches.",First goal went in and you just knew we weren’t gonna get 2 and stop them getting another.

He's earning more minutes which is what he should be aiming for, we have 5 games in the next 2.5 weeks, and then it's World Cup time.

Secondly, I still think the West Ham call was correct, even if it could have gone either way in a 50/50 decision.

What the FUCK is wrong with this team and dropping off in intensity as soon as we go a goal up? This and the CB one touch game?

It's happened so much since Tuchel's spell from *December 2021* that I refuse to pin it on tactics. It's them. My only question is...why?

We need to sort this out as a matter of urgency. I don't care about semantics, we win this game even with the fortunate goal if we just match Forest's intensity. We cannot do this next week.","Despite the result. This has been one of better games and I was quite happy with how we played. Did not deserve to lose. 

A tough game against city where it was always gonna be difficult to control possession, but out of possession we kept our shape quite well and were compact.

In possession is where I was most happy, we weren't scared to play out the back and everyone was confident and composed under any pressure  which I felt we always struggled with. We were better at picking out forward passes and not just passing side to side for the sake of it, we weren't scared to play a risky pass or playing between the gaps. We also showed some good fight after going down. 

This season has been horrible for us for injuries, to have lost Pulisic and Sterling so early was really unfortunate.

Kovacic and Zakaria excellent in midfield, and our young players looking promising.
Loved seeing Havertz finally as 10 and is so much better seeing him in space, more on the ball and involved. Hope to see him more in this role even once Mount returns.

Aubameyang was the only real poor showing and I'm glad Potter made the decision to sub him off despite being a sub.

I really hope we can use this game as a stepping stone to build on what we saw in this match.

Also on a different note we have so much young potential in the squad and I'm happy to see us invest in these young players and build a philosophy and group of players that will be hungry for the club. Even if that means a season or 2 of disappointing success.

Multiple players this season have been mediocre to poor and played consistently until they found their form.,Can we get “Tuchel Out” flair? Asking for a friend. That friend is me.,[deleted],"Uninspired performance, but fantastic result. 

Game flow, opposition tactics, and individual mistakes made it difficult to analyze Potter's influence on the system, which I didn't expect to be all that different from Tuchel's anyway.

I expected Chilwell and James to position themselves higher against opposition backline as wingbacks, but that was hardly the case. Forced our midfield to play combinations with tight triangles with many direct back passes to evade pressure, which was rarely followed by skips or diagonals where the space was - Fofana and even Silva were not quick enough on the ball to shift our attack to where the space was. These, and lack of attempts/success on the dribble, meant we had trouble stretching the opposition who were well disciplined to staying compact.

On a positive, the team showed great adaptation throughout to adjust positioning and play patterns to better deal with Palace - no way to tell if this was players themselves or at the direction of Potter - either way, great to see! Our wingers started being more selective at the runs they made to the ball (i.e. staying away), which allowed better angles for play further up the pitch - Pulisic staying wide and high along the backline for Gallagher's goal is a good example.

That was a tough game with a hard-earned 3 pts. Plenty of room for improvement, but well done to the team!","Wanted to come here and say essentially this.

Was liking Gallagher as a sub, but I imagine he willed he forced into a starting role until Kante/Kova are healthy. Gilmour might’ve just found his way into staying at the club for sure this season…",I think it’s time to give Kepa another chance

One thing though,anyone know where is our Mudryk?","Not exactly a world class performance, Havertz in particular still shocking and no idea how he's starting week in week out, but a win is a win and we needed it.",Man we need a new manager even if it is to instill a fight in our players.

James and Chilwell coming back will make it even better. Our new signings all look excellent too. Enzo is going to be a revelation for us.

They fire Potter, Mourinho comes back just to finish the season, wins the UCL, retires from club football and moves to become a coach of some national team","I love both of them, but how is it possible that both Mount and Kai - who are mercurial young talents, seem very close off the pitch, won trophies together, and have played with each other everyday for 2 years now, are NEVER on the same wavelength as each other. It's honestly baffling.

We should be expecting high quality interplay between those two at the very least instead of this rookie shite we have been seeing. Literally every pass between them is off.",Kepa can’t be anything but an expensive number 2 next season,"I think it is fair to really question what we've seen from Potter while acknowledging that he's had it about as tough as a manager can have, coming in part way into the season, mid-season World Cup, with no preseason (and Potter seems like a guy that needs that) and injuries to many of the best players in the squad. 

However, it's also unrealistic to expect there to be no adversity at all, at any point during the season. Things will never be perfect. What I want to see is some pushing back against all that adversity. At this point,  it's not necessarily about results, but process, which is where I think this ownership will differ from the past. So far under Potter, the results have been mediocre to bad and process middling. 

Going forward, as players get healthy I want to see the process from Potter improve even if the results don't by much. The first of these two City matches was an improvement in process if not strict results, this one not so much.

Players without any confidence.
Players that don’t play as a team, because why pass the ball, when the next guy is just going to drop it.
A manager that haven’t been in this kind of battle before. Where the team he got, were in decline, and afterwards nearly a whole new team has been bought, that also needs to function.
A manager that clearly doesn’t know how to utilise the attacking power he’s got.

Fans that attack individual players, rather than looking at the team combined. That’s just toxic.","I don't want to hear any shred of Potter blame tonight, that was solely on all the players. Chance after chance they failed to put the ball in the net, it's absolutely ridiculous how poor they are in front of goal",Leaving Badiashille out of CL was a huge mistake. It should have been him instead of Mudryk.,Another one is we havent scored from set pieces in ages which used to be a staple source of goal for us under Tuchel.,"Ok I’m sold on Mudryk, our most direct player already.","All these manager turnovers over the years have destroyed all our players ability to properly set passes for attackers. We rely on side to side and back passing that leads to nothing and just adds pressure to every player. We need to change this mentality or else we will be left behind and turn into a joke. All our midfielders are old and stuck in their ways we need to get rid of them all and set a new mentality.

Another thing is not signing a back up for Reece is an absolute joke. How many years have we gone without a back up to Reece and not see how terrible we are with Azpi running around and not doing shit.",No point getting new manager in right now because our season can't be saved.

Arrogant fucker with no redeeming qualities apart from a ""wand of a left foot"" which works maybe one in 50 times",It’d be tremendously unfair to Kepa imo.

How much longer is Tuchel going to employ these awful tactics that offer nothing besides a majority  of the possession (that we never end up exploiting) that makes us rely solely on individual brilliance to get results? This is Sarriball without Hazard, and somehow that was more enjoyable to watch.

Pulisic looked good in the first 10-15 but as the game settled he got bogged down by our awful pacing.

Sterling with a shocker IMO, he offers a lot going forward but is often disposed of the ball forcing us to stop a counter.

Jorginho caught out with another shocker that almost cost us a goal, 4th game in a row.

Fofana had a good game.

Broja with another good cameo.

Chilwell saving us with his individual brilliance.

Havertz with a good cameo as well.

Mendy has been shocking since AFCON man, he’s been dreadful. Absolutely tragic at commanding the box or dealing with corners - West Ham’s first goal doesn’t happen if isn’t shit at punching or collecting the ball.

He bailed us out with an Oscar worthy performance and robbed West Ham of the 2-2.

Tragic all around, this season’s going to be a long one.",He did ok vs Wolves as LB/CB hybrid,Yessssss,I haven't been this outraged since Barcelona,"Conte said he is a tailor,he measure his players and make a suit but Tuchel make a suit and make the players wear it whatever there size."

Take that, doubters!

Garbage hype bait. Tepid manager, at best.","Rome wasn't built in a day. We'll get clowned for not winning today, but I believe the pieces are there and we'll do better as everyone settles in. Thought Enzo was very tidy today, and considering he's had what, one session with the team? That can only get better as time goes on, especially when he's paired with Kova/Kante over Gallagher. Madueke looked exciting too, just need the chemistry to build between the attackers. 

Lovely to see James and Chilly back too","I'm not going to say Potter needs to go, I think that is still just too early, but when is the system going to start showing promise? Why is Havertz still being played up top? Why is Cucurella still getting starts (Chillwell not fit yet?). 

It is worrying to me that the best player on the pitch, by far, is a loan player. Enzo has been playing really well, so that is a positive, but our transition to attack when playing down the left is abysmally slow (when one of the fastest players in the league in Mudryk plays on that side). 

That being said, what are some positives that we saw from the match today? Is there anything of substance that we can take away from drawing a club who's currently 17th?","just saw a replay of that mudryk chance where he took the ball from gallagher, how on earth was that not a penalty? gallagher got completely taken out","Starting off with the positive - Joao looked great , Hall shaky at times but overall a good performance for academy player, Chuk looks like  the most creative player we have. On the bad side a lot of missing players, Joao red card, Zakaria injury, team looks like they have 0 confidence and Potter isnt doing anything to improve that. Its painful to watch but we have to go through this, a lot of things changed and quite a few injuries on our best players.",My expectation now is that we avoid relegation.,"People underestimate how badly Azpi hinders us as a rb. Can't attack, can't create width, can't dribble with the ball, can't track back, and then everyone wonders why our attackers struggle. We are missing a whole person in attack. There isn't anyone to play it out wide on the right. Few, if any, overlaps. No tempo or control from that position once the opposition realizes they can pin Azpi back. It's the price we pay for choosing a veteran we KNOW doesn't have the legs over other players. At least these results will ensure we get a proper rb.",Thanks Cucurella.,Seriously just fuck oooofffff,[still true](https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/vy6qj9/sterling_signs_for_chelsea/ig200l0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3),"Potter in?

The manager isn't the issue, the issue is and has been a mediocre scouting department that recommends players who continually fail to impress.","I don't really blame the players for that first half. Potter got the tactics all wrong, which was clear because they had a very simple way of playing out and into a dangerous area, goalkeeper to midfield, midfield to winger darting wide, winger has a one-on-one and players arriving.  Positives for me are that Kovacic is still in the form of his life, Havertz looked really creative on the ball, and we can play 4-3-3 effectively enough to be a top-4 side in the Prem.",Think Pulisic isn’t in their long term plans and they don’t want the problem of him possibly looking good in a start.,Havertz should be sold in January,"The whole ""7 changes"" thing isn't an excuse when the other team is playing more kids than we are with just as many changes","At least we have Cucurella (although his form hasn't been great) for LB/LWB.

We do not kill games off,"The biggest problem was our midfield. The lineup was similar to against spurs, but we had conor instead of kante. Conor is not press resistant and can't play in a pivot. Our non existent midfield meant we struggled to break Leeds press and feed the ball to our attackers. That's why all they had were scraps to work with. 

We looked so much better in 2nd half when rlc came to the middle. At least he is more imposing and press resistant, whilst being a decent carrier of the ball. But then tuchel for some reason decided to bring off jorgi, who despite his limitations is necessary to control the midfield.

Realistically, we really need a CB, DM and ST to finish the squad. A proper DM will allow us to play with any midfield combination whenever both kante/kova are out. We can also play a back 4 too. So I'd say it's the biggest priority."

Mahrez was terrible. The free kick he scored should have been straight into the wall, and the ""assist"" was just hit straight at the keeper.

I don't disagree our attack has been bad. But Mahrez was not good today... like at all.",He hasnt played a lot recently. It was a fine decision to play him tonight just unlucky,"Oh man the bias against players like Ziyech and Pulisic is so transparent. We’ve literally had back to back games where Havertz and Mount were absolutely invisible and extremely poor on the ball. Even today Mount was quite bad and Havertz did nothing to show he has improved whatsoever. Yet when Ziyech has a bad game he’s the worst player ever that should be left in Zagreb and should never have any minutes at Chelsea. I mean c’mon, what do you mean double standards. Ironically, today although he failed was at least trying to do something by taking on opponents and trying to play it directly into the box. And to imagine he hasn’t even got a tiny percentage of the minutes the other two got, it’s very clear how biased and toxic this thread is towards our bench players.","Been wanting to see Pulisic and Sterling on the wings together in a top 3 and ofc I’m stuck at work unable to watch. The game where they played as the 2 strikers lacked the presence of a physical 9, and then it’s just been 10ish mins here n there","Whatever the fuck Potter told Fofana when Clyne was being treated worked like a charm. 

Fofana played really well in the second half",He milked every second of it lol,"Frustrating to not get the win, but overall I am very pleased with our performance.

Such an uninspiring display. Can't wait for the World Cup break.,"It's not the ownership, it's not the manager that's the problem. It's this extremely frustrating squad that's the problem. No proper leader to lead the attack or players who are reliable to channel attacks through. Im sorry, but our midfielders would be great complementary players but they put out absolute dross when asked to attack. Mount, Gallagher, Kovacic, J5, Ziyech, Pulisic, all of them are so 1 dimensional and jack of all trades, master of none. That it is so frustrating to watch. With the moves that have been made in our recruitment department, im really hoping we get what we need to get this team to challenge again. I'm OK with writing this season off if it means we get an overhaul, and for those saying that it's an absolute must for us to get T4 or be winners of something. We aren't entitled to those things. Years of poor recruitment and hiring/firing has finally caught up along with the fact that PL has become ultra competitive.","Last season I tied myself “this season is a throwaway, TT needs a couple of windows still”. Now I’m “this season is a throwaway, potter need a couple of windows”.","Weird game, not a whole lot happened. Sterling and Auba could’ve been a bit sharper but they didn’t get that much service.

I like him but he needs a long spell on the bench,"probably bottom 3 in the Prem if we're being honest, not a single reliable goalscorer or consistent threat.","I get that Potter wanted to win again but the starting XI was unnecessarily strong for a dead rubber, especially when the performance was only OK.",Europa league here we go,"That was incredible, and he was smart enough to go directly out for a corner. If he decided to clear it straight out, it's getting deflected in for a goal.

Though I'll be honest, he's somewhat at fault for the first goal, took himself completely out of position by pressing 20 yards ahead of the backline and whiffing on the challenge and that led to the breakaway goal.

But it's okay, cuz that's the first mistake I can think of in forever, and he more than made up for it 10x with the rest of his play.","12 shots but just 2 on target.
Atleast our conversion rate is 100% from shots on target 🙃",Lampard got similar or an even larger welcome when he came on for City. Even after he scored against us lol,Gallagher has looked pretty average most of games,Kepa should be the starter imo,Bullshit lmao. He's been absolutely solid in the Serie A. A couple of bad games doesn't change that.,,"We have such a messed up squad right now. Almost every position there's been doubts and it's not because we don't have quality players, but because nobody seems to fit the system they're getting used in.

Last time things seemed to work was with a back five, when James and Chillwell ran down the flanks, our midfield didn't look like it broke down every two seconds either cause of injury or old age, and our attack could be rotated around Mount without with some actual confidence.

But those times are over. Cucurella and Chillwell look set to fight it out in a proper contest, but we don't need that at this point as everything else seems to crumble. The midfield just isn't holding up, but shoring it up by adding a man leaves us with only two actual attackers. Which is actually kind of how we won the CL, but that was when Kante didn't need much backing up, so Mount was free to go forward a lot more. Apart from that, it was clear to everyone that team was created from necessity, not by design.

The only shimmer of hope is the potential return to a back four. If we can get this done, we can get another man into midfield without sacrificing our attacking numbers. Chillwell/Cucu and James can still get forward, though not as much as before, and our midfield might be able to hold up with three of Kova/Kante/Jorgi/Gallager/Mount/RLC. The attacking spots remain difficult. We got Sterling who'd usually go wide and Havertz, whose obvious potential seems only reachable when he plays in the position behind the striker. So the attack would need some testing and tuning, but personally I'd like to see Broja supported by a drifting Sterling with Havertz behind them at least once. Otherwise perhaps actually drop Havertz and just settle on a classic 4-3-3 with Puli or Zyiech on the right. That alone should easily get us through some of the games we're messing up at the moment, right?

It's a mess, but at least personally I can still see a cohesive picture with a little bit of imagination. Rooting for Tuchel to find a way out of this.",Gotta appreciate RLC more and more,"Cucurella was very poor. Chalobah was fine and has been good, not sure what you are mad about.",Silva was immense but I'm giving azpi some love too,"The point in VAR is that because it wasn’t deemed a red card, it couldn’t be pulled back for a foul.

SACK HIM NOW

how many defeats we had in the last 14 games? We are fucking worse than Southampton in number of games won, they decisively sacked their manager just to save their season, what the fuck is Bohley doing sticking with this failure? 2 wins in fucking 14 is UNACCEPTABLE even to a relegation team let alone a team like Chelsea that spent 600m this season

The season is only going to get harder. 
Chelsea are a mid table team and will remain one for the rest of this season. They'll be a win here and there against the likes of Southampton but the moment they face a side which won't fold e.g. brighton, brentford it's well and truly curtains.

You just look like you have no idea about this game, this league or this sport.

You can't be good 100% of the time. I understand people wanting more, but for fucks sake, calling for Boehly out or Potter to be sacked is just so pathetic.

I wish they didn't sack Tuchel, but its been done. We have a chance now to actually build something. Its not going to be fixed overnight. If you can't sit through this building period then don't watch. Nobody will miss you.

This is not me trying to defend that performance. It was fucking shit.

Anyway, Lewis Hall is a good player. A lot of the boys were already in a WC mindset. I guarantee a few of our lads were giving 85% because they didn't want to risk their tournament, and when you're coming up against a team giving 110%, it's only gonna end one way. Newcastle are a cracking side who could really push for top 4 this year. We have a lot to work on and it's going to take time, but I do hope we start to see some improvements soon. Need players like Mount and Jorginho to step up as leaders.

But that’s not an excuse to LUCKILY lose to Soton away 2-1 which should have been 4-1 but for some brilliant last gap defending from Cucurella and Silva.

First things first, I’ve had it with Kai as the CF. He needs to be a bench option going forward. Give Broja or Pulisic some more time with Sterling and Mount to see if some goals start going in.

Second, we can’t be this different without Kante and James. We were world busters with both of them healthy and running rampant vs Spurs just a few weeks ago. Both of those guys out of the Starting XI and this team goes to shit.

Desperately need Kovacic to get healthy and fast. Jorginho is a has been, can’t defend, and gets caught out too many times. Thanks for your service but it’s over. 

Hoping with Fofana likely coming in that will shore up the back line. Koulibaly and Silva can’t do it all and Koulibaly honestly looked a bit lost out there today.

Good news is it’s still early and who knows what will happen? Bad news is these are a costly 8 points lost already this campaign. Can’t have that be a trend going forward if we’re to have any shot at getting too 4 at end of the campaign.","Might be harsh to say this but Mendy needs to improve drastically.

How dense can you be. The line up was horrible. The players look clueless. No wonder as there is no coherent game plan. Potter is tactically inept. Either he’s clueless or he’s trying to make it too advanced too early. We can’t waste more time on a bang average manager.,Still want to back Potter folks!

Coming from a Kai believer he is the epitome of that. 

Kid has the talent but is allergic to consistency. Can’t drop a stinker like that when the team is forced to play youth. This is his 3rd season at Chelsea. Step up. 

When it comes to transfers, I would do exactly what Arteta did and target players that have already played in Grahams system because players are showing they cannot. Caicedo is a must.",That was grim,"Kova and Zaka were good together. The youngsters looked so much hungrier. The sooner we play Hall, Carney, Gallagher etc over waste of time holiday players like Auba etc the better. At least it’s the beginning of a new generation rather than banging the same drum of those who won’t be here soon with hope.",Don’t think he’s come back from his ACL tear yet,Not to worry. Cristiano is gonna come in January and sort this mess out,Gallagher shouldn’t be starting for us if we want to be a serious club. Mount too,"That performance was completely on Potter and his ridiculous setup. 

Why would you not play or best conductor and controlling mid against a team who presses high and ferociously? And then to make matters worst he plays to wingers who have no ounce of defensive intelligence or ability. So now not only is the midfield vulnerable but down BOTH sides are as well, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!

But besides from that I want to get on 2 specific players in general, Sterling and Mount.

Sterling is a signing you'd make when you've got a manager eho lacks talent id or a head of scout who's complete incompetent. It was well known that for 2 WHOLE seasons prior to coming to us that Steing had been poor and wasn't the player he once was(Partly mental and pary physical)yet we still paid 50m of the queen's finest yo get him. A terrible decision that unless Boehly is willing to take a hot on, will hold us back for a few years.

As for good ole Mason""Golden boy""Mount, He's been nothing but diabolical this season outside of a few games and is constantly going ghost when he actually has to play against anyone who isn't the dregs of the league.

They both need to eat bench for at LEAST 3 games to show the team is picked on meritocracy and not names.","Long gone are the days of Lampard, Terry and Drogba etc. We aren't good enough and we're not going to be good enough for a very long time... 1 - 1 was a good result for us because we were dreadful, we just haven't got the players.","How was that not a pen for the foul on Pulisic?

On a sidenote Carney was great very impressed with him",They leave their shootin boots at home every damn game,"Yep, you are more likely to pull a muscle when you are pushing yourself too far when not in shape for it. 60 minutes would have been better to continue to ramp up after being out of the squad and then a 24 minute cameo. 

It wasn't a guarantee to happen, but given that it was a meaningless game, more precaution could have been used.","How many L's do we have to ""trust Tuchel""","I'll start by saying Pulisic had a decent game today he was involved in some good play.

But when world class goals like Havertz scored, a simple lay-off pass from Pulisic or any other player who passed to Kai for that goal is not really an assist in my book either. They don't know he's going to smash that shot, it's not like the pass was skimmed across goal in an attacking play that someone will get on the end of and finish, that would be a good assist.

Havertz pulled a world class goal out of nowhere, it was his goal alone. Just the same as if Pulisic scored a goal like that. The commentators would have said the same thing if anyone made that ""assist"" to Kai.",[removed],Hopefully Willian gets a similar reception now he's not at Arsenal.,"It's really sad realising that FOR NOW teams only need 1 good chance not even a very good but decently good chance to score against us. They just need to sit deep, overload the middle of their box a little while defending knowing our attackers have a fear attacking from the middle when they see the overload and once they counter, it doesn't even have to be a fast counter just be sure to create a good enough chance and eventually in the game our defence is just turned off enough to give you that goal. It's happened this entire season so far. Even more sad knowing that every team we play now knows how to play against us, because it's especially clear that currently our mentality is shockingly super weak. Even though Tuchel was kicked out and Potter will need to time to fix it, I just hope he sees this strange chelsea problem and is capable of finding a solution. It was very clear against southampton and the sloppy and extremely lucky win against west ham. This team does not give me motivation to watch the next few games even if I admit the football looked better today. I might just be pissed off as it seriously ruined my night but I just hope Potter can see the issues and push himself to fix it quickly as possible. Otherwise I and some other tired and frustrated fans might only watch highlights for the rest of the season and we try again next season. Cmon chelsea.",Why do I see multiple people call it a backflip when it's clearly not,This is the best thing I've ever seen,,"I’m tired of cross and Inshallah. I’m tired of tepid recycling ball possession. I’m tired of no physicality or guts in the field of trying something creative for fear of it not upping the possession stats. Do something unexpected or different, it’s too easy going","Jorginho came on and did his very best to throw the match away. I’ve defended him for so long, I am so fucking sick of seeing him play.

Mendy is shit. Best thing he did today was playact as if he’d been hurt, when he’s actually just a shit keeper.

The referees are even more shit.

Apart from that, great fight back from the team. Chilly was brilliant, as was Sterling at times. Love that Kai got the second goal. Don’t even want to call it the winner because it still feels dirty.

This team needs a wake up call, and Tuchel needs to change *something*. I have no idea what he needs to do, but we look like Lampard’s Chelsea out there at times. 70%+ possession and doing fuck all with it",We'll have you watched him play at all this season? Doesn't sound like you have. He hasn't been great till Potter showed up so are you just going off past love? Or were you just going by his FIFA video game stats or something? Because you shouldn't be baffled at all if you have ACTUALLY watched him this season.,"Finally a bit of good fortune our way with Leicester's poor finishing!!!

Very good performance overall!","All of that bullshit aside, I think sterling could've had a better game. I know he assisted for Reece's goal but often times I felt like he held the ball little too long","Mount has been off it the past few months, can't put my finger on it"

The reason why we were so defensively sound in this formation was due to Kante. Now we just don’t have someone with that engine that can continue to win the ball back and counter quickly. Gallagher has that engine but his time in the pivot has shown that’s not his position. Once again our midfield is a problem this season due to injuries and the profiles we have a available. I really wish we would’ve gone for someone or at least kept Gilmour as another option. I’m hoping we are able to target someone like Milinkovic-Savic from Lazio. Our midfield just isn’t healthy enough to take us through such a congested season.,I’m done with havertz. He’s not a bad player but he will never be a great one.,Could care less? What,[deleted],So are we not allowed to criticize Tuchel still?,"Ehhhhhhhh... beating 3 defenders is a bit strong. I thought Puli had a good game but laying a pass off to someone that roofs it from 20yds doesn’t earn much credit imo. Same as his assist for Gallagher.

Still had a decent game, not hating on him or anything but I’m not gonna act like he made that goal","Happy with the result

But holy shit we need all the help from the ref to barely beat Crystal Palace and only had 2 shots on target. This team is shit after spending 270m and Todd needs to take a lot responsibility for this",Anyone have a link to that? Had to miss the match,Aubameyang still goalless no surprise,A new lifeline!,Best I could think of lol,,This has potential to be worst team in chelsea's history.,"- J5 is our worst player and shouldn't be starting for a divison one team full stop

- Mendy hasn''t had that many bad games and everyone is over inflating how bad he is, yes his distribution is poor but he is good shot stopper, he did have a stinker today, but his GCSE drama performance may have saved his bacon

- Chilwell is on another level

- James seems to lose focus every now and then

- Team are extremely disorganised, it seems we have no plan at all going into the last few games and no plan B either 

- Sterling did well as a provider today, excited to see how he plays with Pierre

Over all an undeserved win, but a spot of luck for once is always welcomed","he was fine...won some balls, won some fouls, made some passes and runs with the ball. Not bad, not amazing.",Very proud of the effort from the lads.,Can someone explain y was richarlison not offside for first goal?,You can choose not be reactionary
172,Sean dyche has more top 10 wins than potter. Dyche did so in his first game. Potter has 0 in 12,Glorious evening. Very happy for the players and Graham.,"A couple of conclusions of today...

1. We're going to have the best centre-backs in the Premier League for years. Badiashile is the best buy of the new ownership. At least in cost to performance ratio. 
2. Very happy for the lads and very happy for Potter. I still don't think he's good enough and I still think he will be gone sooner rather than later, but he has bought himself time and I respect that. It was the greatest pressure point of his very young Chelsea tenure and he didn't crumble. 
3. For God's sake, can we make peace with playing a back 3 until we get a defensive midfielder in the summer? The way in which a back 3 allowed Chilwell to run and Enzo to play further forward is precisely what we've been missing. They even created a 1-on-1 for the first time in forever! 
4. Let's add Reece on the right, a little bit of confidence and we might, **\*might\***, have a chance on Tuesday. There's no reason why we can't win it and 1-0 isn't the end of the world.","Fuck Potter is downgrading our club idc what you say about this comment but truth be told, see when you step into a big club like Chelsea you are required to keep its DNA so far all I have seen from Potter is nothing no tactics, looks lost, no action on the touchline and comes out to post match interviews talking about problems yet we don't fix the problems, we fans can only trust the process when we see change I have had enough I didn't really care few weeks back because I was willing to give him time but he is proving me wrong. This job is way too big for Potter and he is not the guy to lead Chelsea tbh, he cannot lose to a coachless club let alone when we have a high caliber of players even though we bought new players it's easy to integrate what you want from the team ffs.

Exactly the type of game I envisioned when we signed him.,I know we have injuries but the worst part is we looked like we were never going to score.

I guess we bring back the suicide threads ?",We all know that potter likes to experiment with formations and line ups but sterling and pulisic can never start as wingbacks again. You cant have two players in that position who cant defend at all. This loss is on Potter,"We look so disjointed.. Like there is no plan for attack.. The free roaming game play is not working.. No particular player played particularly horrible, but overall as a team, we just were not clicking.. Auba and Sterling were muted today, with Auba giving of a carefree vibe.. RLC and Jorginho couldn't do anything meaningful with the ball.. Crosses from wing backs were not good, corners were not good, pressing was quite poor at times.. It looks like there is no clear gameplan, no set patterns for attacking.. Potter needs to do more, cause with the squad he has, he is massively underperforming..",3 ATB won’t keep us in top 4.

Mount/ havertz - Auba/Broja - sterling (sterling is less questionable for me than havertz and mount who I don't want playing at the same time with a back 5 and I want an actual striker every game)",It would be nice if he can fit a through ball in for once instead of wiffing them all but I do not think he’s bad,Hard fought win but something is not clicking - most likely chemistry it seems,"Alright after an hour or two of processing here are some thoughts.

Koulibaly was immense again, what a player. Reece James world class. Loftus-Cheek could prove a very useful player for us this season, was excellent today. Shame about the injury to Kante as he looks good, but Gallagher was excellent when he came on—hopefully he can keep that up as he will likely replace Kante with Kova not fit. Lastly, Havertz, despite all his grit and determination, needs to be scoring more. 

Great game outside of some bald-headed fraudulence. Up the blues!!! 💙",Rather we lose and are able to identify shortcomings in our game too early than too late tbh.

We have to accept that it's not the way the new ownership sees things forward.
Honestly, with a fit squad we'd have a different shot at all the matches we have played so far, we have way too many quality players to not.
Hard not to be disappointed because even after almost 20 games the team is struggling with an identity here, the freaky timing of injuries doesn't help, Zakaria was really coming into his own. Thought Felix had an excellent start as well.
Let's just hope that once we get some of the players back things get better and we start seeing the true direction the club is expecting.","Jorginho, Havertz, koulibaly, Kepa, and Ziyech should never play for this club again.","This team has too many soft introverted types.

178,Happy I didn't wake up for this.,Nevermind that we are the worst team in London in the Premier League. We just showed everyone why we are the greatest club in London,Got absolutely smashed by this team at the beginning of the season and people are really complaining about a clean sheet and 3 points at home.,Trust the process guys. The players look improved and potter coached a win. We will hopefully win the championship in 4 years time. Up the chels!,anybody putting this on Potter is just out their mind,"What an awful, disjointed match","This sub is a cancer. On the bright side - maybe if we'll lose couple more some of those ""fans"" will lost interest in football.","Mudryk, Noni and Joao is about to be electric",![gif](giphy|cDkHKN3UGiuOs),Pure trash. I’m fucking done. These players are fucking hopeless. This club is finished.,Can't wait for Potter to make this result sound positive.,Lost on purpose to keep arsenal from the title?,I’d agree with you if that was what they were miserable about.,"I feel sorry for Potter for ditching Brighton where he was flying high and rosy, even though he and his staff knew fully well what they were signing up for when Boehly approached them after Tuchel. The composition and the components of this squad are massively underwhelming compared to the squad that he and Brighton's recruitment team had (finally) managed to compose before he left them.

We have so many players who are past it with regards to how football has evolved and this is one of the reasons why Arsenal were so better than us today. 'Midtable' and 'relegation-fodder' teams beating 'top' teams in the PL is not and won't ever be a freaky occurence anymore. Nowadays even the GK, the CBs and the CDM have to have high-IQ ball-handling, space awareness etc.",Potter blasted into space,r/chelsea in full potential now,"Anthony Barry fuck off from this club. 

All we do is have 11 players in the box when defending corners and still somehow concede. 

Even if we clear there is no one upfront and then balls come back in our penalty area. 

I am disappointed with the display. 

We never look like scoring. 

Mount was off today and should have been substituted for Gallagher. 

Draw feels like a defeat this is the sencond time we have conceded an equalizer in dying minutes.
And both were on set pieces. 

Again Anthony Barry you suck.",Havertz is just a slow Werner,"Cucurella started really well, was hospitalised and clearly has taken time to get back to form after that. 

I don't see why you would be going at him with that context, especially with how excellent he was today.",Nah,"Did they forget how to pass the fucking ball forward and in the spaces between the players
My good that passing from side to side and then back to the defender or the GC 
The f is happening","Eh, I think it's important to try to win every game in the champions league so I can't see such a big rotation.","I saw something different last night despite awful defending 

So, we put many through balls and lob passes forward, we tried more risky passes 


I say I like it, but if we do that often, we must have a proper ball winning player, we will lose the ball often if we play like that


If we want go on attacking a lot, we could play both Mount and Gallagher as AMF, like City did with De Bruyne and Silva

The thing is, we just need ball winning player, could it be Declan? Should we go for Kessie?",Minutes for Chuk and Costa didn't murder or maim anyone.,"Long ride back from the game. If we could clone Sterling and throw him on the right, not have Jorginho give me a heart attack every game, and not rely on old legs in defense, then we might have something here.",Well the Fofano injury really pissed in my cheerios…,"Yeh. He’ll still do other games this season though, it’s reviewed at the end of the season.",,"We used to have a club identity. Ever since Sarri, we have lost it",James was dreadful after getting that yellow card,Did u not see the different quality chances they had compared to first half because of KK coming on?,Chalobah surely is our lucky pendant,Has Taylor ever given a bad call in our favour?,"Coming from an Arsenal fan:

I don’t understand why for the life of me Tuchel isn’t playing James and Chilwell as the wingbacks and Cucurella as the LCB. I also don’t know why Boehly was so intent on a third LB when a striker is desperately needed. RLC isn’t at the level I’m afraid.

Letting go of Tomori, Guehi and Abraham wasn’t smart either. However, if Chelsea go back to playing James and Chilwell as wingbacks and sign a striker and goalkeeper they’ll be fucking dangerous again, who knows Broja might produce the goods."
179,I've ran out of excuses to accept.,"Remember how shite we played vs Southampton?
What a difference tonight.","Potter in, Potter out I don’t give a shit just score some goals and win some matches","I think Boehly's long contract strategy backfired, we can't swap out Potter relatively easily now.",This one IS NOT on Potter. Jesus christ they cant score,Can't say about the attackers but I am sure this midfield will be a good one with Kova and Enzo.,"Didnt watch the game today (odd timing), but i can see literally nothing changed from the previous game. Players i expected to be good were good, and not were not.

Sigh..",We actually made forward passes. Potter has Ziyech being what we’ve been expecting which is great,Let's just pay RB Leipzig to free Nkunku now please...,"January 8th: Out of the FA, out of the Carabao, 10th in the league.

Trust the process (of relegation). 

I’ve never had less confidence in a manager since I started following Chelsea (2001). Shambolic.",Luis Enrique?,Chilwell >Cucarella,same half chances that gave Spuds and United late draws,The start time for this game was 7am on a Sunday morning. Not worth waking up to watch that kind of effort.,"OT based on everything else from the match, but my god the love fest for Newcastle was disgusting.  No mention at all of the oil money.  Just this perky up-beat feel-good narrative from a down and out team.  

I don’t remember the same narrative when RA took over Chelsea.","I really try not to be a downer but there’s a lot of bad consistencies with this team over the last few seasons:

1) The thing that bugs me the most is that whenever we go down i have no confidence of a comeback compared to other clubs. Sure sometimes we come back but it’s nowhere near enough to actually give me confidence once we go down. It’s so irritating. 

2) if a team is in a poor run of form, they always show up against us for a 3 point gift.","1. You knew it was coming. The very moment that penalty was given, the equaliser was guaranteed.
2. We should have lost this match 4 or 5-1. That's how much better they were than us.
3. Sterling is becoming an albatross. He has the first touch of Jack the Ripper and his decision making is worse than Titus Bramble.","Leaving on Havertz is inexcusable. He was absolutely shite, how on earth can you keep him on for 80mins?",This is actually a fair take.,Because Cucu has played a ton of matches,"I was hoping for more time to be added on but the truth is, we could’ve played another hour and not score. We were horrible today other than the first 10mins. It’s like our players shut down once they scored",Sadly feel like we've been saying that for 2 seasons,"Got out of jail. Mount and Havertz shouldn't start together next  game.
One of them needs to be on the bench.",Good day 4 sure,"Ziyech is lost. He's gone.

Unless something crazy happens in the next 2/3 games and he starts redeeming himself, if he gives out another performance like this, he just needs to go asap.

Loan him out, do whatever. Just please keep this guy out of the team.

His facial expression of disgust when our supporters were mad he was screwing up every action on the pitch spoke volumes.",It’d be a walk in the park with 11 x James,Serie a is a farmers league just look at Lukaku. Horrible player who looks good when he plays in Italy,,"Pulisic giving Bakayoko a run for his money for worst ever appearance in a Chelsea shirt. Gave the ball away or fell over every time he got a touch.

We desperately need someone who can score goals and I fear this result will just push us towards a 120m bid for Gordon.","Another howler by Mendy. He HAS to get dropped.  
Fofana was excellent, as was Mount when he came on.  
Jorginho again getting dispossessed and giving away a potential goal.  
Havertz was great, goal aside. He doesn't excel as the lone striker but put somebody else up there for the defenders to mark and all of a sudden Havertz has time and space to play in",He's played there for us before,"We need that heart the rest of the season. If we play with that level of concentration and energy we can do special things. 

Happy for Sterling. Reece, Thiago and Chalobah were immense. Havertz was strong in the 2nd half too, some good no.9 play.","Anyone got a clip of that lovely Havertz flick? Believe it was him and Mount (?) Involved, over near the touchline",[deleted]
180,Get potter out my club,"I've noticed we've started with really aggressive pressing in the last two games which has set a good precedent and provided a great platform for what I think was the most fluidity we've shown in attack possibly all season, certainly in the first half. I don't think it's a coincidence that that coincides with a bit of consistency in our selection choice in the midfield and forwards. So great to see Chilly and Reece firing again, but I thought Cucu had his best game in a Chelsea shirt also. Love the fact Kai has just got on with things and quietly been putting in solid performances playing the role the club needs him to, culminating in what was an excellent performance tonight, big man for the big occasion! Most I've enjoyed a Chelsea game in a long time","Good game, but still disappointing. Could have been another average Potter game if not for Fofana",I hear all this potter out but we never solved our goal scorer issue since tuchel.  If we can’t score goals we can’t win.,Saw a lot of progress.  Way more direct passing through the middle,"I thought Enzo looked great, especially having just barely joined team. Solid on the ball, made some great long accurate and danger passes, and won a lot of tackles. Excited for the future!!!","Coufal was marking murdryk a lot closer than emerson was on madueke in the first half (it changed a little bbit in the second half, i think moyes told emerson to close down the space). This is why murdryk didn't receive the ball too much, it was the same against fulham. Teams are afraid of his pace.",Pretty encouraging game imo,We’re bad. And the medical staff needs to be sacked.,Doom and gloom.,"Potter out, what an embarrassing performance against the worst team in the PL.","1 win in 9, half the squad is injured, 240m spent on nothing and someone we just give up at halftime, just wanna skip to the summer",We allowed them far too much of the ball. They only created nothing because they don't have quality in any position on the pitch. Like I said comfortable win but you can't do this against most sides in the premierleague.,"Really feel like it was a shocking decision to start Havertz over Pulisic. Multiple times Havertz would pop in attacking positions with space and then decide against actually taking on his man, despite time and an isolated 1 on 1. He is such a timid and unimpressive player. Never in a million years would Hazard get that opportunity that Sterling gave Havertz on the left and not try to beat the man and get a shot off. Pulisic is not Hazard but I think he could have caused some problems for Gabriel. Havertz does not cause problems for anyone.",Potter out,"Fuck this team, how we are so consistently shit in PL. Now, the only thing we can fight for this season is the 4th spot","It is what it is. Obviously unlucky, but I’d rather be unlucky than have the Tottenham bullshit.

Biggest positive is Potter making tactical changes, he (figuratively) ran rings around Ten Hag today. Plus Chalobah was fantastic once we switched to the four.","![gif](giphy|fQAB6YeBqLNlVKlppN|downsized)

damn we’re back to the Chelsea that I know 😐","Again with the Tuchel revisionist history. We were shit from December 2021 to September. Even before that, we were shit in the league and only good in CL. We literally lost on the final day and only got top 4 because Leicester bottled it. We were NEVER consistent in the league under Tuchel , but if you read these comments you’d think we were prime fucking Barcelona under him. FFS",Definitely looks like he pulled it pretty good. Had to get helped off the pitch putting no weight on it. That’s a couple of months injury right there,"That was a very sorry display

I hate this possession game we play. Too slow, too lethargic, don't take a shot in anger. Don't take a shot at all really.

Tuchel needs to do something drastic for our attacking woes. No pressure to Zagrebs defence, not making them think, not forcing mistakes. Genuinely embarrassing for the club",I legitimately don’t see how that’s possible,"Don't think Chilwell is getting his position back from Cucurella.

Injury has ruined his pace by the looks of it.
Such a pity if he won't be the same as he was before .",[removed],That goal was on Cuccurella for making an undisciplined rush up when we already had the lead and being out of position.,Absolutely.,Sure let’s pretend Napoli didn’t batter Liverpool…,,Doesnt look like chl next season with the way we’re playing… shameful performance,"Idk how many times we need to see this movie to realise that we simply do not have enough quality.  
  
Our players, most of them are average at best.  
  
the past 3 games now we changes the system and now we changed the players and it is still the exact same problems.  
  
isn't it already alarming that our biggest goalscorer is sterling who we actually jut bought ?  
  
isn't he in the same system as the other attackers? how come he has more goals than all of them combined?  
  
how come RJ is our best finisher?  
  
People like to blame individuals (Mount,Havert,jorgi, puli...) but the fact is it's not an individual fault. They get changed around in the last games and so does the system and it's always the same problems.  
  
What the fuck are we doing in training for corners and freekicks btw? defensevily and offensevily.  
  
and tbh I blame the manager as well for not giving the players who want to be here the chance.  
  
I do not believe that they are better but they want to be here so they care at least so fucking give them the start.  
  
and next time he might as well get his priorities right in the transfer window  
  
he prioritized defence when we do not have creators in this team  
  
instead we got a mid in the last day just caus we panicked.  
  
Chilly's goal does not change my feelings at all as it was individual brillaince and mistakes by WHU players  
  
Chilly has to start games now tho. He did really great since he came on.  
  
also Mendy can fuck off tbh. He cost us the first goal and then the second goal that surely got removed by VAR but still another day that could be fucing given.  
  
and whatever the result is in this game we do not deserve top4 so far and we are by far one of the worst 5 teams in the league.  
  
still 3 points are 3 points so I'll take the W and sleep on it.",He played cb when kk had the suspension.,Great win all things considered. I don’t understand our strategy of sitting deep from 60 min onwards. We were dominating them and then just let them come back and honestly survived due to sheer luck and Vardy’s form. We are not the same team to shut shop without Rudiger and with Azpi and Silva all a year older,"Based on what I could dig up, each of the following players are Premier League proven on some level and score at least once every four games. Why aren’t we targeting: 
* Brentford - Ivan Toney, Bryan Mbuemo
* Leeds - Rodrigo
* Fulham - Aleksandar Mitrovic
* Wolves - Morgan Gibbs-White
* Crystal Palace - Wilfried Zaha
* Manchester United - Christiano Ronaldo
?",Is today the day that this Gallagher in midfield thing finally dies?
181,Tuchel coming out of this looking like a million bucks now. As bad as our offense was then surely he could get this group more than 1 goal.,I’m high as fuck on this win,"Win is a win, but what a dreadful performance yet again. Absolutely shameful that Potter is still employed.","I wish owners actually had the balls and ambition like they acts they have.

Pricess doesn't depend on Potter. If a process can fall off when we fire Potter, then it wasn't a good process anyway. We can keep the process and can grt a good coach too.

Also be safe Azpi.",Performances are very slowly picking up in the right direction. It’ll click eventually.,"I'm not saying potter out or anything, but it looks like our only tactic is sideway passing or cross and inshallah",I’ve done a Wikipedia search on hansi flick’s CV and I like what I saw. I’m open to it Todd.,Thank God Darwin Nunez is SHIT,"We can’t can’t keep sacking managers and expect things to change! It’s the squad of players, they looked so sloppy and lazy in possession. The first 25 minutes I thought, here we go, it looks like we’re finally gonna put an opponent on their arse; how wrong I was.

How the hell are Havertz and Mount still getting game time? Mount’s holding us over a barrel and asking for £300k per week, and then he’s playing like that?!

The biggest issue we have is that every opponent is using a high press on us because they know our defence makes a lot of mistakes. We need to play direct counterattacking football, draw teams in and then hit them on the break with pace.","I can't wait for the next game. We need win ASAP. So much pain, it's very difficult to stay positive, but it won't always be like that.","£300m spent to not even finish in the top 6. Boehly masterclass

I hope all the NPCs keep repeating that wonderful meal shite, it's all fun and games as we fall further behind rivals. 

To top it all off, we have a Gareth Southgate regen managing the team. Man talks in platitudes and has looked significantly worse than Tuchel.","Zakaria player of the match for Chelsea easily - has to keep his place in the team. Their goal was definitely a Kepa mistake but he's been unbelievable so far this season so you can't complain too much. Really impressed by both Hall and Chukweumeka when they came on, would be happy to see both of them start - not least because it would relegate Cucurella to the bench. Gallagher, as usual, gave it his all and stands out like a sore thumb in a team that seems frightened to run with the ball. I've given up on top 4 this year so wouldn't mind just letting young players get some game time and seeing what happens, not massively interested in the Europa League or the Conference league.",You win,"Arsenal fan here. I come in peace.

Some of the signings Boehly made were really suspect for me. It stunk of an arrogant yank with no football knowledge. He needs to allow Potter to make his signings. 

Chalobah and Loftus-Cheek aren’t Chelsea quality for me. Still baffles me why Tomori and Abraham were allowed to leave. 

Really don’t understand why you guys signed Auba. Performances he made like yesterday are the reason Arteta got fed up with him, not the media narrative of him purely being late. 

I would back Potter and allow him to make his type of signings. Sterling, Havertz, Mount, Gallagher, Ziyech, Jorginho, Kovacic, Pulisic, Koulibaly, Silva, Chilwell, Cucurella and James are all top players imo and Chelsea have the best academy in Europe atm so there is a future (unlike Utd and Spurs)

However Potter must be backed and academy players need to stop being sold.","People told me Trump would not win in 2016, well that devastated me.

I’m not watching us against fkn sheriff.,[deleted],"For the life of me, I don’t understand why Kai wasn’t taken off at the 60 min substitution. Like what does he bring to the pitch over Broja?",Insane take. Tuchel LOST THIS TEAM. We played even worse under him at the end. Why did you forget that?  Youve got to be insane to think we are as good as city anyway. Apparently you thought that. It's like today we were suddenly expected to be the best club in the world even though our roster is far behind that of the Cities and Liverpool's of the world. It's really your perspective that's causing your confusion. You are demanding us to be better than City when it's not possible currently.,Wut?,That last pass by jorghino summarised the game  pretty well,You could tell he was maturing from his mistakes in the first 20 minutes.,"Back pass FC

Its like we're allergic to being direct and decisive; incredibly frustrating to watch

They went from playing in super well managed and organised teams at the WC, playing like warriors, to being in a team full of misfits and lack of passion and organisation. 

I’m obviously not expecting the same from say Azpi, KK, Gallagher, Mount, and Havertz as I would from Modric, Amrabat, Ounahi, Gvardiol, and Hakimi but still, this is Chelsea and not some 3rd tier club. We’re supposed to be the best so we have to do much better.","top 4 is gone, thanks todd you useless cretin. shame on tuchel for not wanting a player who now plays in saudi arabia though!",Looking forward to all the reasonable and measured takes....,I ain’t a karma whore and you don’t tell me what to do,"Some perspective-

1. Arsenal had literally a full strength team versus ours which had arguably 7 first choice players unavailable (including the entire back 4, GK and 2 central midfielders) .

2. We didn't play well but for a fortuitous goal would have gotten away with a draw against a table topping, confident Arsenal side. Talk that Arsenal ""dominated"" is ridiculous- we ""deserved"" to lose as played fairly negatively but I'm not sure Arsenal ""deserved"" to win given that they created very few clear chances (2 shots on target to 1).

3. Arsenal are in the third year of their building under Arteta. He has had 4 transfer windows and has spent big to mould a team in his image and has had the time to get them playing the way he wants. Potter on the other hand has inherited a team consisting of at least 3 different managers contrasting styles (Sarri, Lampard and Tuchel).


I am married to a Gooner season ticket holder (so haven't enjoyed this season very much!) and watch Arsenal alot as a result. They've been excellent but I remember how bad they appeared in the early days of Arteta (far worse than we do right now). They decided that he was the right man and backed him through the tough times just as FSG did (and are doing) with Klopp and ADSG did with Pep. 

Look beyond short term results- CL qualification is moot if we aren't going to challenge. Finishing third is moot if we aren't challenging for the title. Winning one of the domestic cups is a nice bonus. The most important, heck, the only, question is whether we think Potter is the right man to make us title challengers by the 2024-25 season. If he isn't, a good run of results shouldn't spare him. If he is, let's back him as fans and encourage the board to do the same.",So glad we sacked Tuchel right at the start of the season. Its been so great with Potter in charge. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face),Much needed loss to awake the team.,"Azpi and Jorginho, 2 of the worst players today.

Spine of the team is so bad",If Pulisic could play like this all the time he would be a solid starter for our club. He really needs to work on his consistency. I feel like it's mental.,"And you have touched the problem. Time is needed some say, the new project takes time! We why do we have to regress everywhere off the ball? Tuchel made big strides after about 10 games. Within, what 2 months? We played exceptionally against Atleti and then continued against City, Liverpool, Real etc in Tuchel's first few months.

Fuck I miss the old regime","Even putting aside starting, I just don’t get why he won’t play Pulisic 25 minutes instead of 8.",I'm buying a Zagreb kit,I honestly think this game would've been lost under tuchel.

Saying “it’s never a red” as many people are just blatantly goes against the rules. You can feel the call is harsh on tomori, but you can’t agree with the call and not the red.

I’m not sure who can be the answer at the ST position internally or elsewhere. A difference maker is hard to come by, but we need one fast. Not quite Potter Out yet, but I’m having a tough time seeing what exactly the plan is with the ball.","Damn, even worse",Lmao,Only option now is to sack Potter and liquidate the club!,"1st goal was a rare mistake from Silva, 2nd and 3rd were very unlucky own goals, I thought. You could argue that the tactics got Brighton to even be in those opportunities.

On our end, the lack of preparation and fatigue (having just played away in Austria a few days back) is the bigger culprit for me. Players out of position and not having time to really learn them (especially in the wings) cost us mostly. People will call for Cucu’s and Chalobah’s (sad his streak is over btw) heads but where were Puli and Sterling the majority of those times? How many times did you see them having to watch/defend against 2 Brighton players bombarding down the flanks? Or getting 1v1’d? 

People saying Potter got it completely wrong: Connor had 2 clear chances early in that first half that would have had us level way before we conceded the 3rd. He scores those, I think we wouldn’t have played so open because being down 2-0 in that atmosphere, you feel like nothing will go right that day and you just get rattled. If Sterling just made 2 less selfish/boneheaded plays in that final 3rd Puli or another player on the far end were in on goal. I think Potter knew we didn’t have the time to tactically prepare for this match so he went for the jugular offensively with this line up hoping we could curb-stomp and get out in front early and just hope that pure talent carries us to results. Brighton we’re goalless in their last 4-5 matches(?) or something like that, and he was counting on that fact to continue. But whatever reason, Brighton got a hold of the Leeds secret stuff from when we played them. 

Potter changes the system 2nd half, get a quick one but couldn’t follow that up quickly and then I think that’s we lost our chance not scoring a second in the first 15-20 min of the second half. The changes after that were long shots as I think we had the right personnel, it’s just they had no more legs left unfortunately so they weren’t effective anymore.","Well, what do we expect when we have The types of RLC, Cucu, Sterling, Auba, Jorgi starting. This team is mediocre and is being carried for years by good coaches and the likes of mount and james. Absolute shambles this club. We outspent City for years now and we regress with each window because we buy dross like lukaku ziyech and the likes. I can’t think of a single signing that has worked out since Silva and before that it was Kante. We are literally being carried by single players or good coaches for half a decade now and it shows. It aint even fun anymore, the club has become soulless with absolutely zero identity and it shows on the matchday going fans, online fans and players/staff. Long gone are the days of having 5-6 core players and building a team around them. We now have mount/james and avarage overpaid players at best or total financial holes who we are better off not having them near the club at all at worst. Sigh",With such a shitty play I don’t think we will make the top 4 to be honest. Frustrating…,"Fully agree, we are looking worse now then under Tuchel. I feel like we are back to pre-Tuchel, late-Frank era.",Just say what you want to say...you don't have to link your own comment from a week ago multiple times.,Cant believe i wasted 100 minutes of my life for that shit,He was right outside the box with a clear opportunity why would he recycle all the way back to the other end of the field?,That’s the Gallagher we watched last year!,Nice for us to get the late goal and put the game away rather than let the other team back into the match,"Liked a lot of the new ideas Potter implemented.  Probably should’ve created more. 

Conceding was due to one big mistake from Thiago.",The Bridge was pretty good tonight actually. The TV mics don't pick it up properly. Yeah there were too many tourists but the MHL and Shed were singing.,"This is not the correct opinion. You should be mad at those decisions that are wrong, not when a ref makes a correct decision. It’s just fans who don’t know the rules of the game who are complaining.",,"Tuchel’s insistence on back 5 without the available personnel is shocking. 

Insists on playing out of form players too.",Why are people blaming mendy for the goal that got overturned? It was on reece james with that header.,"Difference was mendy actually did, and yet somehow retained his spot under tuchel. Nice to see potter being objective about the GK postion.","Performance full of heart, love it.

Build a statue of Thiago.","I'll start with the postives: 

Mount dropping into the midfield  in the first half was a brilliant tactical desicion by tuchel, it allowed the midfield to link to the attack and win the ball in spurs half quickly after losing possession. 

RLC was pinning back Sess which allowed RJ freedom to  push and support the attack, we were effectively playing a back four in possession and back five out of possession. 

Kante ran the midfield, Jorginho was excellent too.

Havertz brilliant off the ball movement, should have scored. 

Negatives:

First goal could have even disallowed for the foul on Havertz as it was still the same phase of play as the ball went forward to our box and didn't reset back to the halfway line. Also, Richarlison was offside and moved towards the shot which obstructed mendy.

Second goal is a blatant red card, violent conduct.

Jorginho should have cleared the ball on first goal, he got away with a couple of risky desicions throughout the match. 

Kante and Kova injured, worried about midfield moving forward. 

Overall, Tuchel is an elite coach but this team is still a few signings away from title challengers.

P.S. Spurs aren't finishing 3rd.",We need Maguire asap.
184,Cant wait for this sub to gobble up the PR this week. Just wait 48 hours and the positivity and proppa lads are back calling us plastics.,Not sure if Kante gets ahead of Kova anytime soon after that performance,"Good: 3 points

Bad: We played like shit. Leeds was horrid and still only won by a defenders goal. 

Ugly: Just extends Potter and mid table mentality of the Potter In fanbase.",I’ve been quiet until now. Losing to this south Southampton team is inexcusable and unacceptable. Potter out,"I’m not sure whether to be optimistic that the style of play seems like it’s coming together and the team is way more balanced, or be nervous that in spite of this we seem to have a team of players who still can’t finish. Could’ve scored like 7 today, but we’re consistently not converting. I think we’re on the verge of gelling into something special… but what if it just doesn’t click? Someone just needs to bang them into the back of the net. Who is that going to be in this team?","Mount, Gallagher and Havertz awful today but it’s been said many times in this thread already. I am NOT surprised though.
But once Felix returns we should be better going forward. But Potter I beg you. Do NOT shoehorn Mount in to the squad. He needs to be benched. If you don’t bench him and we continue to drop points, while I back you Potter now - I won’t be backing you much longer.

And as for Havertz and Gallagher, they honestly need to leave the club. They are simply not Chelsea quality.","A friendly reminder to report any comments that break our community guidelines and contribute to a toxic atmosphere - everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

He’s straight garbage. Brings nothing to the team.,Potter is so bad.

The loss stinks but we still somehow exceeded expectations. This was better than City at home last season when we were top of the table, fully healthy squad and still had 0 shots on target. The question now is how do we manifest this? Will we put in a better performance v Fulham in a week's time? Or will we go back to playing like we're in League Two and get bossed over 70 of the 90 minutes?",Pulisic was as wasteful as ever. I can't remember the last time he had a consequential contribution. Since Liverpool.,"Anyone calling for Potter to get sacked is a disgrace, they cry about the management of the club always sacking coaches but are the ones who turn on a manager straight away. 

Take arteta as an example, many arsenal fans wanted him out but the board and Edu were backing him and the project over the course of years, even if it meant that they would finish 8th etc, now look at them at the top of the table and a well drilled team, Potter will need a few years and windows to find his type of players + the key ones back from injuries","Quit watching after they fired Tuchel, came back to see what this Harry Potter thing was about, think I'm done for this season. This was really dire to watch. You can call it a rebuild or whatever you want, but we'd be lucky if the new standard under these new owners is like arsenal at the end of the Wenger era.","So so so frustrating seeing us being so toothless, while spuds turn their game around being 2 goals down.. 😤",I will rate Potter below 4 today. He should have brought on the subs around 60th min. Not sure why it took him too long. It was quite clear some players needed to be subbed off.,"Havertz and Jorginho have had their time. Not the players they were, constantly looking for a pass back instead of bringing the ball forward. Happy with the broja start but unlikely at the weekend.

Potter was pulled out of Brighton mid season, had to shift to the biggest club in London, one of the biggest in the world over a weekend. Had a good start, with a full squad.

His ‘terrible streak’ is losses to: Arsenal, Man City, Newcastle, Man City x 2, Fulham (top 6, on form). All top 4 teams, on form with near full squads. 

Im no Potter fan, he’s a good coach - Chelsea are in a tough position, we’ll be back and we’ll fight for top 4, just back the boys and head up to get the W vs Palace and get some good luck on our side.

Tuchel needs to sort this out","Lessons learned from today:

Chilwell has to start over Cucurella, he has to, excellent performance, 1G 1A, in like 25 minutes, brilliant.

Mendy needs to be benched, I'm sorry, horrible for both goals today and has been underwhelming for weeks now, I know Kepa isn't the best option, but what else can we do? Kepa should atleast start in CL on Tuesday.

Fofana is brilliant, could become one of the best CBs in the world in the future, excellent tackles.

Reece James was probably our best player today and is probably our overall best player, but what was that before the disallowed 2-2 goal, horrible header.

We desperately need changes quick, since this performance was pretty bad, didn't create a single clear cut chance before the 70th minute, literally just passed it around for 70 min, it was so boring and we got very very lucky today.","I wouldn’t say a lot, but the difference is that so far under potter they’ve been interspersed with good results from good form.",Great win.

They suck, the lot of them.

&#x200B;

Mendy - Couldn't really do much, but I can't help but feel stressed whenever he has the ball at the back.

Koulibaly - Absolute crap, supposed to be Serie A's best centre back but looks completely lost and puts zero effort in for the goal.

Chalobah - Subpar performance from a guy who has been consistently decent recently, but it's clear imo he's a bench player at most.

Azpilicueta - Captain and a legend, but he's way past it and not good enough anymore. Should've been shipped off in the summer to Barca. '

Hall - Only player I'm going to praise today, got stuck in and atleast put effort in, it's insane how an 18 year old can go in and immediately be our best player, says a lot about the mentality in our squad.

Loftus Cheek - Injured

Jorginho - Poor today imo, our midfield was wide open and it's clear we need a midfield revolution.

Kovacic  - weirdly enough a shit performance from him today, gave the ball away in dangerous situations way too much and didn't really contribute much

Mount - Not been good enough this season, 2g/2a in 14 appearances, g/a which came in 2 consecutive games, other than those games he's been horrible and he really needs to fucking step up.

Gallagher - It's clear to me that he is a good presser and that's it, not good enough with the ball and just doesn't strike me with any confidence.

Broja - Didn't really get much service but he's not good enough with the ball to be a starting Chelsea striker imo.

Pulisic - really poor performance from a player who had a lot to prove

other subs made no impact.",This team is full of shit players,"Still not a convincing side. Our summer transfers aren’t good enough. Tired of hearing how good Pulisic is when he comes on fresh and manages to run past someone, but doesn’t actually do anything. RLC isn’t even a bench player for a legitimate top 6 side.

It would have been harsh on the irons as despite having 70%+ we barely carved out many clear cut chances in the second half and West Ham defended well. Cucu had another poor game and is like a deer in the headlights every time the ball is passed to him. Not strong in the tackle either. Needs dropping for an extended spell. The build up play was usually too slow with little structure and we always ended up being dispossessed quite easily. Other than Chilly the subs didn’t add any value when they came on. Was never convinced about Potter, even before he was appointed, and every passing match confirms that he is out of his depth at a top club.

If you have no integrity you will never have a great team.",This could very well be the equivalent of Arteta's 3-1 win against us few years back.,I find it hilarious how Potter began to panic with them subs.

He needs to be sacked!,It’s me again - potter out. U guys finally agree with me now about this loser? Enough is enough,We are looking better each game. I'm hopeful. I think we win the tie in London in regulation.  I'm hurting now but no desire to be negative. CFC,"Ultimately another frustrating result but here are some of my takeaways from today:

Enzo looked good on his debut. Need to get him a good partner that’s a bit more defensive minded so he doesn’t have to sit so deep and can make something happen within the opposition half. Kante or Kova would be a good partner this season.

Reece is back. His minutes were managed today but I could see him getting the full 90 next week whether or not it’s the right call. Can’t ignore the drop in quality though when he’s not on the pitch, even when he’s not 100% fit. Respectfully I think Azpi’s time has been up for awhile but it’ll be nice to have Gusto come summer. Nice to have Chilwell back too as I don’t think Cucurellas the guy to play when hes out but don’t see him going anywhere. Also feel for cucurella a bit as hes been unable to really take a break from the limelight either. 

Understand the Mudryk sub. Low on minutes/fitness, apparently had a cold this week too according to Potter’s post match interview I saw. What I don’t understand is how little he was involved in our play after seeing his cameo against Liverpool where I thought if we score it’s coming from him. Everything seemed to go out to Ziyech where it was then lost. He had the good ball to Kai but that was pretty much it for me. 

Madueke, and Fofana had good moments. It hurt when Fofana ended up missing that chance. 

The back line minus Cucurella looked good overall. Will be nice to have chilwell integrated back in. Badiashile is a beast. So calm and his partnership with Silva is working well. Feel bad he isn’t in the CL squad. Could see that potentially hurting us if someone other than Fofana is back there with him in the center. 

Mount needs some time on the bench. Really not sure what’s happened to him. Are the contract issues really causing this? I love him and don’t want him to leave but I’m not sure that I see him in our best XI if we sign a defensive midfielder and keep Felix. Kai too. Unlucky hitting the post but he’s really out of it in general. Poor touches/decisions and that’s not to be forgotten when he scores the odd goal. 

Our new signings are very direct players and our other players need to learn and make quicker decisions where/when to make runs and pass the ball. This will come with time and building chemistry…I hope. 

8 days until West Ham. Hopefully the boys have a good week of training and a quality dominant result. 

Now I know…we have many new players, new young players with great potential, players injured/coming back, and players that are playing because of injury necessity. 

I’m confident that we improve next season but I really hope soon that we take a leap forward rather than one step forward/one step back staying stuck where we are. I’m not gonna say getting 4th place is impossible but it’s going to take a lot more than us just gaining some form. We also need the teams above us to have some rough patches so we can catch up. Earlier we had games in hand but now teams have games in hand on us and we’re below them on the table and in worse form. 

“Preseason” needs to start right now. Potter needs to figure out who has a place in the squad next season, who doesn’t and roll with that. Let them build chemistry so we have a head start on preseason that we can continue building on. Will be interesting to see what the squad looks like when everyone’s back and fit and how potter handles it. Many sources claim he is backed by the board so maybe he should toughen up a bit. 

Wow, that was a lot to type but crazy how if I were speaking this to someone it would be like a few mins haha. Curious if any of you agree with what I saw today or anything I missed/didn’t write here.",I'd take Brenden Rogers over Plopper at this point,"Not a win but first time in a long time I saw a certain spark in a while. This game also made it clear the talent we’ve missed in a while.

While tough, it’s clear to see which characters will probably be leaving over the next transfer window.","Absolutely tragic what i’m witnessing. There is absolutely 0 chelsea DNA in any of these players except for reece, chuk and silva. (Newly promoted/integrated academy boys are exempt imo)

Fucking hate with every inch of my fibres the lot of them.","He’s getting a pass here because the overall performance was bad, but harvertz’s hand ball was so brain dead and unnecessary and it basically tied the game up. Like, totally stupid and I am starting to think he’s actually a bit of a dick.","Disappointing for sure, but thought Silva, Zakaria, Pulisic & Ziyech did decently.

Auba is really not up to the level though, I hope DDF gets a chance to prove himself.

Koulibaly + Azpi just doesn't work on the right side..

Enzo would be good for slowing down the game and to provide some cover but we also really need a RB backup. Juranovic maybe?","Denis Zechariah take a bow son, I knew you will become a Chelsea starting quality soon enough and boy you played truly amazing

Hall, you indeed are a hustler; so this kind of lb was in our academy and we splurge £62m for cucurella? My God! Sometimes I think we lack technical value of our grads so much.

Chucks was great, growing in confidence and ability 

Kepa is really growing in leaps and bounds on confidence 

Hutchinson is not yet ready for men's football

Kovacic is Kovacic, we know his qualities and his struggles on the final third

Why did we buy abumeyang?

The young guys were damn hungry, they ran their socks out, chasing all the balls, even mancity, although being technically and tactically superior were dazed by their shear hunger. To me there were better off than some of the regulars via their sheer hunger.

I am not pained by this loss, I mean the guys played their hearts out they left with their heads high.

I love you silver. Keep the blue flag flying high no matter what",Lost the possession too many times. Was short space too often to intercept. Too late to position a few times too many.

This 'mercurial/chaos' bullshit really needs to stop and fast. More consistency is needed.","Simply setup wrong for the game and I think Potter didn’t want to lose his first big game at the bridge. 

Better after the change but tactics were not there to win. It was like watching Tuchels final games all over with slow negative build up play marginalising our forwards with no support from midfield. It’s still early days for Potter getting his setup right. We really need someone who can take a decent corner and teach our defenders how to manage on set pieces. 

Jorginho really is only good at pens. Was a liability the whole first half and just a a bystander in the midfield. Rather have chukuwameka on who at least looks physical and positive. Chalobah had a great game and for me was MOM. Overall fair result as neither team deserved to win and Kepa unlucky not to get the clean sheet. Not the best but not the worst day either.

So many players did not want to stay yet we still kept them.

You can blame Potter too.

Play mount at no 8 or 10 or keep him on the bench same goes for Gallagher. 

We have become what Arsenal used to do hyping youngsters with 1 good performance. 

Bin half of the team out before the start of next year. 


Ziyech, Pulsic, Auba, RLC, Mendy, Kante(because he starts missing 70% of total games)  Kai Havertz to pain me to say this but don't think we have figured out how to play him. 

If we bin them and replace them with those who want to play for Chelsea, we will be a lot better team.",I have faith in Graham but our age is showing. The players are talented enough but they don’t make the right decisions off/on the ball to create clear chances so our games are decided on if players can finish half chances.

Get a fucking grip","I wonder if we kept Havertz again Tot, he might have save that corner…","All I have to say is that we played against two teams and came away with a draw.  If Jorginho punts the ball high in the air instead of being cute in his own defensive box, we win 2-1.  Both Spurs goals were pretty and that is the best I've seen them play in a while.

Mount and Havertz struggled to keep up with these 2,"There was a point in that game Mount ran into one of their players and was shrugged off. You can't keep starting him, people complain about Kai, but he and Felix were bright until we went down to 10, Mount was bad after the first 20 minutes or so. I think more than any other player he's suffered from Kante being out because he needs someone to cover for him so often. He's out of position unless we have everyone going forward and he killed multiple attacks with poor decisions.",Not an ounce of fighting spirit in this team,"This team is nothing without James. We need him to secure the defence and contribute to our offense. Otherwise, it always feels like we are 1 man short defending, and 1 man short attacking, because azpi is simply not good enough anymore.

Also, gallagher doesn't work in a possession based side. He simply isn't comfortable enough with the ball. 

Lastly, cucu worked hard and defended well, but he can't progress with the ball which often kills our attack on the left flank.

James and Mount were 17 

Chilwell was in his first full season at Leicester 

Jorginho wasn’t even playing for Chelsea

Would love Zaha here on a free if he ever leaves.,Nice moment was when Broja went for hard pressing and Connor helped him forcing Wolves to lose the ball and then Connor clapped his hands towards Broja,"Everything apart from the finishing.

Every damn time.,,"It seems like Koulibaly is a massive downgrade from Rudiger. Slow, can’t turn, poor heading, unable to play the ball quickly. 

And for god’s sake never ever play Havertz on the left wing again.",Yooo Kai + broja is the way,Have you watched him at all? If you're just gunna write a player off due to a bad start to a season then you need your head checked. Especially a player that's got as much credit in the bank as Mount.,Reece James hair was sick. That man is something else.,"Utter thievery by the match officials. 

And otherwise solid match ruined by refs. So god damn tired of shitty officiating ruining games.","At some point the finger needs to be pointed at Tuchel. We are getting completely shut down by everyone in the league and while I don’t think our attacking talent is world class right now, they are better players than that. Every single one of our attackers was significantly better everywhere else that they played. They are not being utilized properly and Tuchel is either incapable or unwilling to change that."

People say Auba on, Mudryk should play, Zakaria and so on but this is more to do with the manager. Tuchel brought out the best of even less resources than Potter. Potter is just so incredibly out of depth imo.","Madueke, Badiashile, Silva, Kepa, and Enzo were great. I am excited for what they can bring to our team in the future. 

Cucu was a bit all over the place. Mount looks so disjointed from the rest of the team.  Kai is just depressing to watch now, I genuinely have no faith in him to score again even if he gets the ball in the box. Recce got beat a lot, but I'm sure he can turn it around. Ziyech did very little for us but maybe I was hoping for him to make a statement after what happened. 

I watched the first half, but only glanced back and forth during the second, but our problem seemed to be that we just kept passing backward or laterally for so long.  We do not have the same build up that City have, but still play like we do. Most of our short range forward passes in the final third and even in their half were awful.  Our biggest chances came from deep balls sent over their final defensive line. 

That being said there were some issues that I hope get solved with time, the small like flicks between players that weren't on the same page hopefully can be addressed with training and playing together.

I also thought that the red card decision was really bad. It was stonewall red with his studs showing and leg in the air on the follow-through.","Thanks Vic!

Milan fans were definetly loud but Chelsea fans were definetly good in the second half but were quiet on the TV broadcast.,Yeah he is a good player for sure but he didn’t really do too much over the two games. Only Milan player that impressed for me was Tonali.,,"I don’t kno how many times i’ve repeated the same things throughout this past month…

There have been 0 improvements in this squad from last season. NONE. We’ve regressed even with new signings. Yes i kno some players maybe shit, but we are not an 8th place team.

And that’s down to the manager. 

He lost the dressing room and unfortunately i don’t think the situation will change until he is sacked. 

Now, my problem is, this culture of “losing the dressing room” has been embedded into our club for years. Its almost predictable and tends to happen around the 2-2.5/3 year mark. Why?

Klopp has never lost the dressing room and neither has pep. But why us? 

Wtf is up with us hiring managers that seem to keep losing dressing rooms??","Tuchel is very lucky to not lose his job today

But if this continues he will get sacked, the game is awful, side way passing for 90 mins for what? If you have fast defenders like James Fofana and Kouli you shouldn’t be so afraid of losing possession. You put 2 box to box midfielder like Gallagher and  Zakaria to make sure you can cover the counter attack and start playing some fucking through ball and overlap crosses FFS

Jorginho and Mendy are both awful, absolutely shit. Jorginho get punished every time he gets pressed, stop playing him please unless is a European game. Mendy is worse than fucking Kepa at the moment, he can’t shot stop and at the same time he can’t fucking collect crosses, wtf has happened to him

I am still very sceptical about Tuchel, I think he really losing the plot now and look clueless on both attack and defend, Todd really should be ready if we need a new manager","A 3.6 rating then, I reckon?",Not sure we'll be seeing much of Gallagher in the coming games with these last two performances,Referee gave Tottenham two goals basically,TT needs to change the system not the players.

Today was a step in the right direction and should surely buy Graham some more time for any of you buffoons who want him gone.,"Not being reactionary at all but Mount genuinely needs to go. He offers nothing outside of running all game. Terrible decision maker, no progressive passing, has no spacial awareness, isn’t fast, consistently fouling and being dispossessed. Thanks for the 20/21 clutch CL moments but it’s done. Wouldn’t be a loss letting him go, I feel he’s a key reason our attack is so disjointed. Promising young talent, flashes of quality early on, but when push comes to shove, he has no real standout attributes. Feeling he’s Dele Alli 2.0.","he was poor, no question about it. caught in absolute no mans land for the goal too. He needs to be benched.",The Liverpool football pitch was substandard thank goodness no Chelsea player got hurt. Shameful,Potter out,"Being a Bayern fan and religiously following Bundesliga, isn't it possible that a Chelsea coach could play Havertz in his best position? Havertz was considered a generational talent back in the days when he played for Leverkusen. He's wasted in a false number 9 role","People talking about top 4 are being ridiculous.  We're not competing for 4th this season or any season while potter is here.

Potter couldn't challenge for 4th if he was at City.

The mans teams have averaged 1 goal a game across the last decade, his teams have scored more than 1 goal a game in 21% of his games in charge.

The man is not a good manager by any metric and without a new manager it doesn't matter how much money we spent on talent.

Boehly giving this clown a big money long term contract when he's never threatened to win anything and had a few months of good form after Brighton fans were calling for him to be sacked is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen","We defended in a positive way. I don’t why we couldn’t do that Vs Lowly Forrest. Another positive is the young players, they look fresh and dangerous. Lastly, Zaharia is MOTM.","He definitely has to prove himself, but I do think he's better when he's in a sort of free role where he can roam.","The new manager bounce was done ages ago. Here’s what it looked like:

- 2-1 Vs Palace with Gallagher clutch goal
- 3-0 win Vs Milan side (only impressive win)
- 3-0 win Vs Wolves who sacked their manager
- 2-0 win Vs Milan side who had wrongfully received a red card
- 2-0 win Vs Aston Villa who dominated most of the game and looked like a new team

I mainly blame Todd Boehly for being an idiot and sacking Tuchel 5 days after the latest signings had come in. Could’ve sacked him during pre-season or just listened to the guy who won the UCL and has way more experience and knowledge about how the game works.",Well top 4 is basically out of the question,"Sterling was disgraceful today, no one can defend that.","Draw is fair but I have some issues with this one. Sterling is getting frustrating to watch and Aubameyang was trying too hard to make the sexy play rather than putting the ball on goal.

Absolutely disgusting favouritism from tuchel, i don't think there's any other way to put it. The only players who deserve a 'pass' when they consistently dropped clangers for us in the past are hazard, drogba, costa, and probably pedro.

As much as i would’ve loved to keep winning and simultaneously get rid of deadwood…it just doesn’t seem feasible with the way things currently are.

Nobody takes them, because they’re all on Chelsea wages and would rather run their contracts down to leave on a free.

250m spent in the summer on this shambles as well","Continuing from my sentiment in the match thread...  
Potter is to blame. He is the manager and these are his decisions. Our squad without doubt is far stronger than Forest's. 

&#x200B;

Potter fails to see the game in front of him. We were clearly getting out done by far in intensity. We couldn't keep the ball either. He chose to back Jorginho over Zakaria when making his first substitution at 0-0. I cannot rationalise this decision, Jorginho has failed to impressed and offered completely nothing, while Zakaria had grit in his performance. If he receives the ball under pressure its back to our CB, if he's free he'll just play to the wing, and if he's off the ball he gets ran past. It's been made clear he's always been covered by Kante or a 3rd CB, he's excellent at hiding.  


Havertz is just average, not really good at the ball at his feet. Decent movement and heading ability, can score a tap in if you cross. If you're expecting magic or him to create an opportunity, it won't come. Also I do not think he has the ability to take 2/3 touches before scoring, he can't see ahead or picture what he needs to be done. See the opportunity where he could've chest then scored in the box from the set piece.

&#x200B;

I thought Pulisic was good, but trying too hard. Ziyech/Cucurella/Kepa were fine too. Silva was a class above by far. I do not think Koulibaly was particularly bad, it's not his fault our midfield was non-existent. And you can't play out when your holding midfielder will just give it back to you. 

&#x200B;

We are really missing Kante. He was the glue in our team. He progressed the ball forward and added intensity to our game. I am praying for his recovery because it's the miracle we need right now.",Write the season off. Cut losses on over 30s who are net negatives on the pitch rn.

Great impression from W Fofana

Mudryk and Madueke need to show more","We weren’t as bad as usual but by no means did we play well, we were okay at best. Dortmund were average too and we should have taken advantage.

Mudryk was pretty much invisible, Enzo didn’t do anything much he might as well have been Jorginho, Felix had little impact in the 2nd half, Havertz didn’t really do anything. Ziyech was decent, Reece was pretty good, RLC was very good. The defence were pretty good overall.

The silver lining is that Dortmund are nothing special, and with a couple more weeks together the squad should be capable of beating them at home. Arsenal also lost tonight which is great.",Sack potter,You could see how visibly frustrated he was. Then when Chilwell comes on he takes Mudryk off.,"I know we all complained about how terrible bohly and Potter were doing but honestly I think this is going somewhere.

A muscle's risk of being pulled goes up a lot when you are fatigued from overuse which will happen if you aren't at peak fitness.,"How the fuck is this system supposed to bring us goals?? Like 5 to 6 attackers are standing in line with the opposition defence, there is no midfield, and it is left to the defenders to pass the ball through opponent midfield and bring it to the attackers!! The attacking line is static, which is understandable; since no one is there to lob the ball over the defence, there is no point in them making forward runs.. We have left it to our defenders to be the creative spark, to bring goals, while the 200 mil attacking lineup chills up front..

Edit: I just remembered that I had made a similar comment regarding our teams attack during the end of Lampard's tenure.. Same static front line made up of our strikers and midfielders, while defence passes the ball sideways trying to find a safe opening..",Worth watching the full game it was a great game especially the first half we played the best football this season I think,Fofana needs to shape up his passing and defending first,"He won't have lost it, it's just going to be inconsistent with his age","Better than most performances recently, just lack that killer edge but some positive signs at least.",*Trevoh,"We have so many games of football to play

I mean Saint Max would literally get the ball wherever he was and just turn and go. Like he was better than everyone on the field against City. We need more of that. Our guys need that mentality, they’re too scared to do anything. We’re really good at shooting from outside the box and drilling our players though, that’s about all we get. It’s so draining to watch."

West hams second goal probably should have stood, but on the balance Antonio should have been sent off for one of his fouls on Thiago Silva - who once again was a Rolls Royce. 

Always thought this season was going to be a transition one, and I welcome us giving Tuchel the time. I would like so see Havertz get a run of games in midfield.

1. Welcome back, Chilly.  We've missed you tremendously.  MOTM without a doubt, and here's hoping he's healthy enough to start consistently again.
2. Broja was excellent today.  Excellent hockey assist for the 2nd goal and he never stopped pressing on the goal.  In an odd way, he feels like a much younger Giroud.  Here's hoping he can add the goal scoring Giroud never had as he gets more Premier League experience.  If that 2nd goal is any indication, he could play together with Kai very well.  
3. Fofana had an alright debut, but this defense is overall in shambles right now.  Despite getting picked one time this season already, Mendy still has far too cocky of a swagger to his play.  Someone please remind him he's not even a tenth the keeper Neuer is and that grabbing the ball instead of punching would be better.","You just have to realise English players will be judged simply because they are English.

Our team used to be full of leaders and players who fought. Drogba Lamps Essien Terry Cech Carvalho Ballack Cole in the 2000s. Then Cesc Eden Costa Matic Cahill & Rudiger. Now I see nothing. 

Just players who play. Pulisic shit Kai shit Cucu Shit KK shit. Our transfers have been so bad for so long it's abominable. We had a world class GK in Tbo and we had no fucking idea how to replace him for 5 years. We had a choice of Allison and Kepa we chose KEPA!!!?

And on to Mason Mount. He's not world class. He's an average premier league player who has been our best in our WORST LEAGUE FORM IN 2 DECADES. He's not our talisman.

That last defending from Silva was ass, Aubameyang barely touched the ball, I don't even know what's going on in Pulisic's mind, Sterling couldn't dribble pass the opponents and losing the ball, Kova aswell losing the ball unnecessarily. When we get in the penalty box, we somehow just fuck it up, like just fucking shoot sometimes instead of passing and getting the opponents a chance to defend.

Now that that's done, fuck me Tuchel that was horrible. 60+ minutes of pure, pure shambolic football, I'm genuinely starting to wonder what exactly we do to facilitate attacking play in training.

This could've easily been a draw/loss. Mendy got away with murder because I don't think he affects the play enough to stop that second goal even if he can get up.

That being said, Chilwell is a fucking beauty, earning his starting spot just like last season for sure.

This game also proves that Broja should start while we wait for Auba, and I'm begging Tuchel to play Havertz behind because that second goal is what he's actually good at, making runs to eventualy score. He's a #10.

Either way, we move forward.💙💙💙",,no more Chalobah at LCB pls,Fuck that..,I like Ziyech and I'm sad we'll be losing a quality player. TT doesn't rate him but for whatever reason rates Havertz.

Every time the ball went to him, the attack either broke down or stalled (usually with him passing backwards or sideways).

He might offer something playing through the middle, but our right-sided attack was absolutely toothless today (other than when Broja was running down that channel).",Without a serious chance created ?

Until that changes nothing major is going to change. I like Potter and the team looked better already so I'm hopeful. But I'm not expecting much until we can get in some good players.

As for midfield you could argue we have 1 in Kovacic. Obviously Kante is Kante but he's so injury prone how can you count on him? Jorginho is class in some games and unplayable in others, depending on opponent. That's not reliable. 

Defence I don't even know what to say? On paper we have one of the best defenses around. I think it's obvious midfield does them no favours but then we've conceded so many set pieces, what's going on there?","Fofana goal not Thiago
Rest agreed 👍",Passing the ball centrally through the defenders for Aubameyang’s goal is something we haven’t seen in a long time.,,"TT played the 4-3-3 to tell this subreddit to stfu about it and how little they know about tactics. 

This team has very negligible improvements in Cucu, Kalidou, and Sterling. Yet they’re the only impactful players on the field….even with K2 being a bit shaky (Silva is god tier and nothing can compare to him). 

The team is not motivated; Tuchel statement about how we are easily defeated is so true. The players mental just isn’t that strong. Outside of Sterling and Cucu, no one looks hungry on attack with slow passes, slow rotations in the attacking and middle thirds, we are so quick to pass the ball back. That is not on TT. Mendys shitty hands and feet are not TTs fault either. Ziyech was non existent today, pulis stint…yikes. Mount isn’t playing up to his standards.

🎶Wake me up, when this season ends 🎶","I think we need to be a bit cautious, considering this is his first start in the PL and maybe second overall for us(?). 

But overall I'm an advocate for having midfield depth in a group who have had lots of injuries across the last few years. Kante/Jorj/Kova/RLC have had their fair share of injuries and midfield depth is a must if we are expected to compete in more than one competition. If he keeps up his solid performances, stays fit and is a good price, I say why not? Kante is on his last year, so that's one player and role that we need to account for, and Jorginho isn't that far behind on the contract stakes.","Let’s be honest, this could have been a lot worse. We have 5 of our starting 11 players out injured and another one who is only fit enough to come off the bench today. 

There’s never a good time to get injuries but not many worse times than during a manager transition. If not for that freak goal today we may have somehow came away with something anyway.

Gonna be a rough few games before the World Cup but hopefully once the World Cup is over we might have a couple of those players back and we can start building + it’ll be Potter’s first chance to buy players he actually wants, not Tuchel, in the transfer window.","Lets get it straight: we are not in a good place. Major injuries, changing manager mid way through the season and a bad run of form

And that can excuse results, yes it really can

But can it excuse this performance? Players not knowing where they are playing, choppy changes in the middle of the game, lack of movement lack of sensible build up or game awareness. These are basic things that are developed in training. And our game right now resembles schoolboys playing for funsies

It scares me to think Potter has a huge contract because quite frankly, i dont think he has what it takes. Every thing good that I saw during his current reign were remnants of Tuchel’s game with new manager bounce","I think the scoreline is a little unfair. 
Fair play to Brighton but we were our enemy. 

At least 3 goals were scored by our own mistakes. 

People will criticize Cucurella all day long but he is not an LCB. Even in the LCB position, he was constantly facing so many 1 v 1 against the marsh. Beca of sterling was a WB, no one was protecting him. 

Once he moved to an LB position he was so much better. 

And people were getting carried away by Chalobah's performance saying we should have never paid 70M for Fofana makes me laugh. 
Chalobah is doing great but his sometimes position is questionable. 

And RLC is bum. 
He can play better but he is so lazy every time I look at him he just jogs and doesn't work hard for the team. 

We can all criticize Potter but I think in the bigger picture players let him down first 2 goals were very much our own mistakes. 
And then you miss the sitter and expect to get a point is a miracle. 

We are a few players away to become a great side again. 
Need a DM, a Winger and an RB. 

We are also unlucky with injuries whenever we get on good form our best players tend to get injured.",That ball was just simply not over the line,Rlc bang average. Sterling bang average. Kai bang bang average.,Remember when we were 16th in December?,"When someone “barely plays” you don’t keep them on for the whole 90 when they’re back in a dead rubber game. He should have taken him off 60/70 mins in and brought on Cucurella but no, had to take the risk in a meaningless game",My Vyvanse is no match for the dopamine black hole this game caused,IMMENSE 🤤,Agreed,"Jorginho never shoots, he mearly passes the ball to the net.","Honestly, I cannot understand how people felt today was a lot better. This is not a criticism against Potter because only been here for 5 days but it looked like a familiar story. We started well but drifted off mid way through the first half and we still lacked penetration through the middle. Our goal had luck play a great part in it and it always looked like Salzburg were one pass away from a clear opening which they got in the end. 

One thing I do now get is how congested and pressed up we look when we have the ball. Maybe it's the pitch size at Stamford Bridge but our players have limited awareness off the space around them and it doesn't help that majority of the squad is very limited technically. Potter clearly needs a lot of time and it's also a vindication for TT who openly called out the players.","Chelsea have no obligation to perform self sabotage. 

Leao isn't going anywhere near City this season anyway",Eh?,,"This team obviously has many issues and needs. They could use a reliable defensive mid, a creative midfielder, and a striker. No one signing will fix this. But I have to ask, is Ronaldo really that bad of an idea at this point? Our attack was once again invisible, I saw chance after chance either fluffed or not even taken. Ronaldo would fill an immediate need in attack. We'd also then be free to play Havertz in a more natural position.","Rlc was pretty good as a holding midfielder, kovacic around him was great, connor not that bad. But with only pulisic and sterling, it’s like it was missing a midfielder who is around the box for the final touch or assist, connor can do great with some more matches probably. It has to be complicated to play under Tuchel, a lot of several systems, sometimes the player may be lost, miss the good run or just the good pass. Maybe this is why he has to like so much havertz, versatile and smart",,"Instead of harping on the negatives (of which there are many), let’s please just take a moment to admire the heart showed by the team today.

The only thing I can give this guy is that he’s decent at heading the ball. Am I missing something? Like yeah he’s young and that but I genuinely see no potential and don’t understand him being chosen to play most our games",It's come to the point where I want our players to get embarrassed. I genuinely dislike the majority of the squad at this point including the manager,"Havertz got his goal, and was working hard. He was on the ball a lot trying to make things happen, thought it was a quietly decent performance. Need more of that from him. Also, Kova had no help in the middle.","We wouldve been lucky with a win. A draw is deserved. Personally think Jorginho was awful and we really need to move on. We can never be a fluid attacking unit with him, he fails to make quick decisions and move the ball on fast. He needs a lot of time and space to look alright. Off the ball its almost 1 man down as we need to cover the extra distance. Kovacic came on early to save him which helped up, it was really bad before.

I’m trying so hard to justify his presence but I just can’t because HE CANT SCORE!,It’s almost like Reece should be playing at wing back where he’s the best in the world or something
206,"For love of god get Potter out of here. He does nothing to defend his position here.

Mudryk on bench until 83rd minute and 2-0 down, same with everyone.

His only subs up until 83rd minute, was to bring Mount on and a holding midfielder in Zakria, not saying they did bad, but we were fkn 1-0 down??? maybe some attacking subs to try and win the game? 

Guy has no idea","Cucu played tonight like his first match: energetic, quick direct passes and good defending.

&#x200B;

Happy he is returning to his form","I was Potter in up until the end of this game. I see now that it's the same story over and over. First 15-20 minutes we look great but ultimately we lose steam and I think a big part of that is Potter just isn't an inspiring figure. I'm not talking about screaming and running down the sideline like Conte, I just don't see him giving confidence to our players when they need it. 

It's made me think that maybe we shouldn't aspire to be compared to Liverpool, City, Arsenal, in terms of being sculpted in a manager's image. Maybe we are just a vibes team more akin to Real/ManU of old -- bring in great players, organize the defense, and make the attackers feel like they can beat the world.",What shocks me is that even with new players in we are still awful. It makes me think even with Kante we will still be awful. So it’s looking more and more a Potter issue.,"The negatives are obvious but that’s 2 games in a row where we’ve shown massive improvement attacking, that’s something. Kai Havertz needs to be dropped though, we’re forced to play Ziyech who’s terrible as well. Felix up top and Mount cam maybe? I don’t know but Kai is unplayable imo, he offers nothing in any capacity","Let’s call Tuchel lol, he knows how to set up a cl winning team","Yep. Potter’s seat has to be at least a little hot right? Obviously deserves to get the rest of this season but heading into August, he is managing for his job","0-30 Chelsea much better

Can't argue with that.,cant believe weve lost tuchel for this numpty,TWO MONTHS WITH NO CHELSEA? LETS GOOOOOOOO,"The team doesnt have that fire in them. Brighton run us down so hard our players were lost. Unreal motivation for brighton players while our players looked like they showed up just because they had to. Sadly RLC, Chalobah, Sterling were terrible today. Potter also needs to make subs way earlier and btw ZIYECH???","Sell them all, except for Kepa, Reece, Silva, Mount, Chalobah, Kova, and Broja. And spend whatever we can get + another 200m on better players. This team is not elite and can not compete for any title.",Piss this United game on the weekend is gonna end 1-0 to them I’m calling it,You are overacting,I think City will. They always get the easiest draw,This is the kind of game which inspires a big change. I pray Tuchel screams his fucking lungs out in that dressing room while also looking at himself today. I believe we’ll go to Fulham with something to prove and won’t play as bad. Might I remind you that Real Madrid lost to Sheriff last season and still won the UCL.,Absolutely.,"And we’re just fans, think about the man on the hot seat😂 Potter gon look like viserys targeryen by the time he leaves this club","Well he’s the most complete midfielder we have and as long as he’s healthy he can legit compliment everyone else skill set. 

Just need to expand the passing a little bit but they will come with time. Now that they’ve found a position for him playing deeper in the midfield and he’s clearly also up for it at RWB when we run Reece as a CB.",We are not very enjoyable to watch at the moment,The fact that people were doubting after 2 games is all I need to know to ignore them,Won't be bigger for long seeing as how Chelsea easily dismantled your team without our best player Kante twice with a clean sheet. Easiest win we've ever had since Juventus last season significantly easier than 3rd division club Plymouth. Enjoy watching history channel seeing as you won't be dominating Europe any time soon.,,"Lessons learnt:

4 atb wont work

Mendy's ass

We're allergic to forward passing","Stop finding fault with keeper when the mid & defence isn't doing him any good. Its easy to point fingers. And Edou is having a dip just like the whole team is having. Stop picking him out just because he didn't win you points in FPL. Keep supporting. This is a CL winning team, remember those moments when they gave all for the badge. and we will be good again.",,What a roller coaster of a game. Conor has to understand that this isn’t Crystal Palace and there are higher expectations,"Hard to not feel robbed, but to all the people on here that were saying they weren’t confident about the match beforehand you gotta fix up for next game, if we don’t believe how can we expect the team to! Don’t complain after expecting a loss regardless. KTBFFH.",I’ve noticed Reece’s ego has been slowly growing.
207,Why do players we know are on their way out keep getting minutes? It makes no sense,I really forgot how to celebrate. I used to lose my voice from screaming. This win was cathartic.,"Everyone saying ""Shit performance against a relegation side"".

This game was about 3 points and 3 points only, nothing else mattered.","Next time someone on Reddit talks about a player being a snake and leaving us, remember how this sub is treating Mount. 

Loyalty goes both ways.

It doesn’t mean pretending they are playing well, it does mean not spouting shit about them for weeks.",Good thing we brought on Mason Mount there while down 1-0,Gallagher and Mount are disgusting! Can’t pass. Havertz is so useless in front of goal.,Na even bad West Ham are hard matches against us. They can have a bad streak and always brings it.,"I simply don’t see a spot for Gallagher in an attacking, possession based team. He doesn’t have any vision, his decision making is extremely poor and his technical ability is just not it. I’m happy with him staying until the summer, but he should be sold for profit and to fund other, better midfielders. He runs, that’s it.

I’m willing to cut some slack to Mount because he’s shown he can be a valuable player for this team but he has to improve fast.

Cucurella with a very good performance, Badiashile is looking like a steal and Mudryk is electric. We should shift the ball to his side more often. Havertz with a good performance as well.","I saw enough of Potter, with a fit squad, to suggest he could be the man to move us forward. Thing is I'm at a point where I don't know if I'm deluding myself into thinking he could get us out of this disaster we're in. I don't think anyone could tbf, Luis Enrique, Zidane, bringing Tuchel back, don't think anyone would be able to do it. Before anyone says anything about Tuchel, we were going down this road with Tuchel too just look back at those last few games.","Don’t think they’ll hang their heads in shame, think they may be happy to go back to their part time modelling jobs and over inflated wages. The worst part about how shit we’ve been is the players hardly look like they care, how can you go down like that today without even attempting a fight?","The city matches are just gonna be procession you already know. If we’re extra good maybe we’ll lose just 1-0.

City has always been a decent matchup for us. Especially with tuchel.","Overall I liked the way we played. Saw some really encouraging stuff out there and was impressed with a fair number of players. Kai played well as a 10 (who knew, right?), Zakaria put in a great performance, and some of the young players were great going forward.

Yeah the result was disappointing, not sure what the left side of defense was doing for the goal, but let’s try to stay positive.","He's €30 million euros, so £26 million pounds. And honestly with solid performances like the one today, no reason why we shouldn't buy him, even as a utility player. He brings strength and defensive presence to a midfield that desperately needs it",Tuchels team doesn't loose a game like this against a top 6 team.,Someone posts the mid table coach talking about how lucky we are to go into this break....and set the bar even lower for the season. Potter has been the biggest mistake of this ownership and it will years to recoup.,Missed the match… wtf happened,"Typical Chelsea.

Bottled again...",Those are the points you don’t want to drop going into a tougher run of fixtures… Feels like a loss but can’t say we deserved the 3 points,I thought Cucurella was good as well.,Fair enough. I think that’s to be expected tho,Sucks to see other top teams scoring goals left and right and we here struggling to complete passes against Croatian farmers.,"The only downside to Jorgi is his pace imo. For their goal you can see him trying to get back, but there was just no way lmao.",![gif](giphy|8JrcyXvpOaFbFIatkm|downsized),"Another player that we're just hoping can finally be consistent with his performances for the medium to long term, alongside Pulisic. Signs are good atm",Tuchel out! Oh wait,It wAS bAsICaLly MiLaN’s B TEam brO!,Fuck off back to your own sub,,The only reason I'm not Tuchel out is there's no world class manager available rn.,"Came back from the game. Mendy is awful, deserves the bench.  


We controlled the game  from the  start  however the attack was dreadful, just constant  cycling of the ball. Pulisic offered not threat with his movement.  


Broja changed the game,  became a problem for their centre halves making space for others. He has to start. Was  genuinely so awful without him.  


  
Jorginho is finished, he came on failed to  control the ball, lost it in our own third and West Ham  hit the  post.  He's  not worth  the massive  liability he is.",,"Nice to see the team fight back and win a match where things didn't go their way. Seeing that resolve is a good sign. Also, I love Thiago Silva.","Don’t let the VAR disaster distract you from the fact that Havertz is stealing money from this club. Ziyech, Pulisic, Werner all roundly criticized for not being good enough, this guy costs more than all of them and no one says anything about his performances.",Same shit as last season nothings changed
208,It's clear that we're in a monumentally bad mental rut. It's never going to be fixed until we force a paradigm shift in the squad and get in a new manager/coaching team. We just need to hit the refresh button and get in somebody with a BIG personality. His name begins with M.,Kai in 2021 form LFG!!!,Sack him anyways,"Thoughts from in person today on the subs up front:
Sterling had a decent run at things today, not good enough to create out of thin air (which is our only hope at this point) but brought the team up a step. 

Havertz was fine - fought hard to win balls sent up from the back but nothing interesting within 18. 

Mudryk was terrible. Needs to actually get coached up to premier league level or he’s going to be the next Timo.","Potter is a fucking coward if he keeps playing Havertz.

Also, I know this might seem like hindsight, but why the fuck is Chukwumeka in the squad instead of aubameyang?",Potter ain’t the man for this rebuild,"It happens every 3 years. That’s the life cycle, if we’re lucky","I’m one of mounts biggest defenders but nah bruh. You can’t be off form this long and expect a contract especially when younger players are better. 

Chuk came on and literally just fell over 50 times. Not sure what that was about. 

Mudryk looked a class above anyone on the pitch on both teams. 

Ziyech good, whole defence good. Midfield weak as usual. 

It’s clear we’re improving and that’s with still an entire team injured. Very optimistic. 

Mudryk and Felix on the same team is gonna be dirty",At this rate we’ll be featuring on season 4 of *Welcome to Wrexham*,"The worst part is that Potter knows he’s invincible for the moment. This was always going to be a long term project, but I truly hope he felt those chants today because that performance was disgraceful. There have to be consequences.","I’m usually more of a voice of reason when it comes to our performances, but that second half was bloody terrible.

Kepa & Silva were the only players from the starting XI to put in good performances.

Gallagher & Ziyech looked better than any of the starters after they came on.

I lost count of the number of times Awoniyi got the wrong side of Koulibaly without even having to really beat him. I’m very concerned with the prospect of KK being a fixture in our defence for the foreseeable future. He plays like an oversized Gallas with none of the speed or mobility to match. Looks unsuited and under-qualified for the PL.

Havertz was back to his worst today. I’m a big fan and his ceiling is very high when he plays well but he was so slow and indirect today. He looked like he’d been given horse tranquillisers before the game and spent most of the time floating about at half the pace of everything else around him, in some kind of stoned daze. And there’s no guarantee it won’t be the same in the next match. I hope we manage to sign a striker that hits the ground running because Kai looks unmotivated in that role and god knows Aubameyang ain’t it either.

Pulisic was up to his usual speciality of becoming a ghost as soon as he gets a few consecutive starts and the chance to nail down his place in the starting lineup. And I’m sure Ziyech will take over doing the same if he gets a chance to start rather than off the bench.

We still have some great players in this squad but they are so inconsistent individually (with the exception of Thiago Silva) that it’s frightening. Potter needs time but doesn’t look any closer to knowing what his best formation is, let along the strongest starting XI. Some of that may be down to him, but it must be difficult when the individual players are so hit and miss. Concerning times.",Kepa watching the cross go by looks worse every time I see it,"Mate, you’re contradicting yourself. My  comment stated how he lost possession. You rebuked by rephrasing that same statement as a question and answering it by saying he was dispossessed zero times, using a dispossessed stat to rebuke lost possession state. 

I then responded by giving you the 
data of him AS A DM losing possession 7 times, I never not once talked about him being dispossessed. 

Also, the reason why literally our two centre backs lost possession less is because it is always expected of centre backs and DMs to rarely if ever lose ball possession. Silva had many games where he had zero, today he had more than usual. Context matters. 

In terms of him being dispossessed, I don’t know as the stat for it isn’t showing. But stats are only one half of the picture. He looked slow on too many occasions and didn’t challenge for the ball enough. This was against Bournemouth too. I imagine if it had been against Liverpool, he would’ve looked like a snail out there.","I am sick to death of people here saying “Potter is awful, shouldn’t had sacked TT for this”.

Behave yourselves. Potter isn’t the problem. Let me remind you that Arteta never beaten Potter in fact LOST to Potter’s Brighton every time. Arteta got one over Potter today not because of him, but because of the bum players that have let us down time and time again - whether it’s under TT, Lampard or even Sarri.

Until we get rid of the bums and replace injury-prone players bar James, we are going nowhere.","I honestly don't know how we are trying to play. Passes overhit, underhit. No conviction, no confidence and no belief.


Potter:  yeah some postives. Newcastle are a massive team. Lucky to only concede 1","Can we do a sarriball 4-3-3 lineup for 1 game?

Kepa, KK, Silva, Azpi, Jorgi, Kova, RLC, Sterling, Pulisic, Auba","I've said it to my brother and I'll take the down votes, but we aren't winning shit with Potter. I'll eat a shoe if we win UCL or the league with him. It'll never happen. Can't wear TTs jock.",WHY IN THE FUCKING FUCK CAN'T WE BE MORE DIRECT LIKE WE WERE AFTER 70 MINUTES? WHY DO THESE LOT HAVE TO DO A MILLION TURNS AND A MILLION TOUCHES SO THAT EVERYONE AND THEIR GRANNY IS BACK IN DEFENCE?,Just give up football. It's not for you.,"To be fair with the way Potter keeps bouncing him around from lcb to lb/wb he hasn't been able to settle into a role with a lot of new players around him. Lineup lottery is getting old already for me but I'll keep the faith.

Gotta back us to win at home against Arsenal but just hope to God Kova is fully fit and we don't do the Sterling/Pulisic wingback experiment again.","I'm beginning to question Tuchel's leadership.

Yes, players are responsible for their own conduct on the pitch. Yes, the team needs time to coalesce with the new additions.

However, when tactics aren't effective at creating the desired end product, and when the majority of the squad puts in mediocre or subpar performances week after week, one must consider the possibility that leadership is the problem.","Kepa was fine but a little shaky. Goal wasn’t his fault obviously but he struggled with a lot of crosses vs the very large lads of Salzburg

Nothing to really get on him about, but didn’t really have a standout game either",Teenagers become old hags here after watching a month,He's so versatile. At times he does look a little unrefined which I suppose is a knock on from inconsistent playtime and changing systems but the footballer that had him so highly rated as a youngster is clearly in there.,man gallagher was bad,"Not a potter doubter myself, but I imagine they’d be saying new manager bounce is in full flow, which wouldn’t be hard to agree with😝

Potter out now.,"Mudryk was horrific as well, don’t forget. 100m won’t make you a good player. Overconfident, first touch like Lukaku, decision making like Mason Mount.","Sell Gallagher, Havertz and Mount this summer.",Lampard had a full really good season as manager with a far worse squad than either of his successors.,"It has to be said, Mason Mount has regressed so much. He was casual in possession and his through balls were terrible. At least Ziyech reacted to the Noni signing and played somewhat better. Mount needs a long spell on the bench, he has gotten very complacent.

All in all, a point away at Anfield is never a bad result but we definitely deserved more today. Mudryk looks pretty good, definitely lacked sharpness but it was predictable after not playing for a couple of months. Can't wait to see him link up with Felix. Also, Badiashile will prove to be a fucking bargain, mark my words.",Felix looks like the real deal. Too bad we won’t see him play for us again after a month.,[deleted],"Potter was wrong today, bringing up tuchel every game won’t help and the players are deluded to think they deserve their weeks wage. Goodnight everyone.","Can someone explain why the ref just lets teams get away with time wasting bs?

Rodri takes out Gallagher(clear tactical foul), then starts dribbling the ball away and Gallagher has to run over and shove him down.  Rodri somehow thinks he did nothing wrong and looks bemused.  Both of those things could be yellow on their own, but ref just gives City captain a talking to about time wasting.....",,Tuchel >>> Harry Potter Sr,"You know it's bad when I'm genuinely happy about an international break.

It would have been 3 - 1 if not for the miracle goal line save by Silva where Mendy was ball watching AGAIN instead of sticking his hand out. Thiago Silva single handedly carries our back 4 every game and that’s not sustainable over the year. 

Our midfield is hot garbage and was non existent once Jorgi was subbed off. People need to understand we don’t have a creative mid at all. Kova was absolutely poor and wasn’t able to really complete any takeons either. 

Havertz and Sterling need to finish those early chances and we need to control the game more efficiently.

I really liked our attacking play today as well. I don’t think they were prepared for it at all. That first half was such a good performance, and really deserved to be 2/3-0 up by half time on the balance of the play imo.

And of course, the elephant in the room: shoddy reffing today. I think we’re stuck in a vicious cycle: poor reffing cops abuse, which makes reffing less attractive, which leaves you with worse referees. It’s a systemic issue and with the lack of quality young refs coming through, it ain’t getting better. We got the (very) rough end of it today, maybe we get lucky next time. But in general, I think this is a serious problem for the brains trust in football to solve.

Also, because it will make me feel better: fuck Anthony Taylor!","It's an unpopular thing to say, but Lukaku, Werner, Havertz were all left isolated in this system. People say our attackers are not good enough, but they were / are good enough when playing for other sides

I think the teenagers or those that have started supporting recently need to have something explained to them.
Performances like this are not new. This squad and these players have been putting in regular poor performances like this across 3-4 different managers now yet they are rarely as criticised as the management. Most of them aren’t good enough, nor have they ever been despite a Champions League win believe it or not. Our scouting team has been firing blanks for ages and has resulted in a team that doesn’t understand what each other is doing. Boehly has come in with little knowledge of the game and has seemingly exacerbated this problem by signing a bunch of players that aren’t good enough yet again.

You compare this now with Arsenal, who have stuck by a rather inexperienced manager and have shedded old deadweight players (one of which we signed for some reason) and now they are putting in great performances, while signing good players.

A project that was built with barely 1/5 of the resources he'll have to work with at this club. Let's be patient, building good things takes time and a couple losses. We'll get there.","5th consecutive draw, this fixture is cursed…","Havertz and Jorginho stealing a living. The myth of jorginho controlling tempo and games is complete bullshit, I do not know how he has all these supporters who spew the same repeated bullshit about him. He plays againdt 10 men AC Milan and people think hes the greatest ball playing midfielder in the world. He has no attacking threat or vision and he’s physically weak defensively. Please move on, and get him away from the 11 so we can finally move on.


Havertz has no good traits other than heading, he’s just so far from this level.",Yeah if them two weren’t playing we would have won for sure.,Nah?

What has that fraudulent american actually shown in the last 6 months that gave tuchel the idea that it would be a good idea and to deny broja more playtime?   
What is Mendy doing? He's so obviously lost his nerves, it is 100% obvious and apparent to everyone watching, and to all our opponents, and yet this very simple fact somehow eludes Tuchel? I call BS on that. Bias has no place in a professional football team that's aiming for the pinnacle.   
Why has cucurella lost all his talent and drive that he showed in the first game? Why does he now look like a cheap knock-off of Emerson, without the good dribbling bits? His passing is now so weak, nothing like those crisp passes he played in his very first game for us.  
Those passes out back line play among themselves, is fckin horrid. It is so lazy, so predictable, and just wastes so much time when our young midfielders and wingers are better off taking risks out front.

If you think otherwise, you're delusional.",," After the RLC miss, havertz offside and the red card i thought it was going to be one of those games again but great resilience from Chelsea. we got quite lucky in the 2nd half i think though and Chalobah got exposed a few times, he kept switching off against vardy who had 3 1on1's missed.","Awful subs by Tuchel, needs to be held accountable.

- Badiashile and Silva looked good and composed. 
- Mudryk did good enough for me to believe he’ll be a good signing. 
- Ziyech is really our only threat on the ball when it comes to passes but I like that he seems to be playing well lately. 
- Cucurella did decent defensively but that’s not saying much. Still continues to be useless when we attack. At least for now this is an improvement for him. 

Negatives:
- Gallagher is not good enough. I’ve seen enough. All he has to offer is energy. 
- Carny I’ve seen enough of to realise he’s not ready. Guy has just not really been all that. I think I only seen one decent performance of him and that was when he was at Villa. 
- Mount deserves to be dropped. His form has been horrid and is offering us nothing. 
- Hall had a bad game but it’s expected every now and then. Despite his shortcomings I still like his bravery and his ability to not shy away from trying things out. 
- Jorginho really didn’t offer anything today. 
- The overall level of play today was terrible. It felt like a secondary school team playing at times.","Dude ran circles around everybody…including our own attack.

Conte is a great manager but his second season with us was pretty bad,"Can people stop saying about someone being not good enough? Ramires was not good enough for Chelsea by those standards either. Not everyone has to be perfect with touches and ball every time, sometimes you also need athleticism and energy. 

I see his flaws in that aspect as well, but you have to consider him being nervous and still adjusting to system, he will get better over time.",,Please attach all goal/highlights video/gifs as a reply to this comment,How can our defense is so clueless?,,Great 3 points and all but we definitely would have drawn/lost if maddison started,“Another poor decision from the ref today” GET HIM TUCHEL,"You're conveniently ignoring the fact here that barring Lukaku we had these attackers under Lampard too, and they never looked threatening under his system too. The bets in the window with Timo and Havertz quite simply did not pay off. 

But yes, once it's known that the attack isn't good enough, it's the manager's job to change the system to suit their needs. Once he changed to back 4 after the first half we were definitely better. (We were decent in the first 15 minutes with the back 3 and things would have been different if the chances were taken)

But today's match shouldn't be the one to judge things. It was Mendy's fuck up that led to our shattered mentality following which the defence switched off. If that doesn't happen, we would have come off better through the 2nd half.

Tuchel definitely had a sucker today, but this is far too early to question him. We just don't have the right players and subpar attackers do not help."

Every ball at city player, what did Auba do? These youngsters should be coming early and should be ahead of players that are here on vacation, even atleast the desire is way better than nothing. Potter needs to show more guts to bring these guys.

Everyone was like Cucu was great because he made few last ditch challenges in first half, did nothing up front, Hall isn't even a LB, showed more than a 62m plus LB we bought by bending over for Brighton.

As much as I love Lampard and Tuchel....I didn't see this under them. I felt that a big part of this loss were our injuries and some members not being fully up to speed. Cucurella playing a makeshift CB role and being completely left for dead by Sterling. Same goes for our right, where Chalobah was left for dead by Pulisic. The lack of a DM also really hurt us. I felt 2-1 Brighton, was a more realistic scoreline where credit should be given to Trossard and Estupinan forcing our second OG. That being said I'm funnily optimistic for what the future holds.

Reece needs to pull the trigger more often when it comes to cross or longer range passes. I feel like he’s dwelling more than he needs to, possibly because he knows he won’t lose the ball but so many runs go missed from when he picks up the ball. I’m sure he has the same ability as TAA to make the same passes.


Azpi should only be a backup. Bed in Fofana and we maybe have someone more progressive with play from the back.


gallagher Broja need to be in the team in exchange for Mount and Havertz atm. Take them out the firing line and let them rest up and refocus.

West ham and Liverpool however were in fairly poor states when we played them, we outplayed both for large portions of the game and came away with a point each time.

If we get done by 2 or 3 goals by Dortmund in the first leg, then follow that up by not taking full points against Southampton or Tottenham.

We cant when pressed or against a low block create for shit.. here we didnt face either press (leao/giroud) nor did we face a low block.

And with 4 main pieces out milan was a very weak side",How high up are your balls? That's a question I didn't think I'd ask today,,Tuchel should be sacked! I’m predicting he won’t survive until January.,Not pretty but ill take the 3 pts. Hopefully we can build some momentum after this,,"Just remember. Last year we had Saul. Gallagher will develop, showed a sign of what he can do with that brilliant tackle before the cards.",Gonna skip the complaining because everyone else seems to share my opinion already. But god damn am I proud of the way we played today. This was our best performance since the 2nd leg against Real Madrid and it was so much fun to watch! Everyone was immense bar a couple of finishes from Kai and Raheem. Shitty result but lots of positives to take from today - a great game to build off of.,It’s interesting to see the sentiment on r/chelsea shift regarding chelsea. I started posting criticisms of his tactics and match management during the 2nd half of last season and was absolutely ridiculed and attacked for even questioning Tuchel. Seems that the majority are starting to open their eyes to the fact that we haven’t had a proper run of PL form since Nov/Dec of 2021. The 2nd half of last season was an absolute disaster and we were very lucky to get top 4. Tuchel really needs to try something new. Rolling out the same formation and tactics for the entire rest of the season is a recipe for disaster - we won’t be getting top 4 if that’s the case. The alarm bells have been going off since Jan 2022.
226,People were saying we had a long road ahead when we had lampard. Then Tuchel came in and made us into winners immediately. We need a manager who knows how to work with top players,Where can I see this tackle by Jude?,Great to get a win but Potter won't cut it. What were those substitutions.,"If Potter survives tonight then he is here to stay no matter what. If we decide to part ways then all these months have been for nothing, struggled for the sake of it.

Slipping was all he knew.",It was nice enjoying football for 6 weeks.,Zakaria is the positive from these last 2 games. Looks like a decent player,"This team doesn't care about Chelsea. Most of them don't care about the shirt or the club. They're on nice juicy contracts and it doesn't matter if we win or lose. The manager can't drive them towards a common goal by lighting a fire under their asses. 

Tuchel did that during our CL run but having a soft baby shit manager was more important for the owners. The fans are to blame as well. We have the worst home crowd in the league with opposition fans out voicing us both at home games and away games. 

No clear identity starting from the owners to the fans with the players and coaching staff the most to blame","If we play like we did in that first half against other sides in the Prem we will be fine. The problem is we don’t play like that. 

We also need to fix the torrid record we have against top 6 clubs. We never win against them.",,Under that manager under the news owners we are just a laughing stock of the league fuck boehly fuck potter fuck this new era,Its getting to a point where I can't imagine a team play worse without actively scoring own goals/ getting red cards and such.,We gave them way too much in the first 30mins to give us any sort of fighting chance. We got the home crowd fired up for them after some very early howlers and it was all downhill from there. Shows just how much confidence and support is like a snowball.,"Awful game, wasted the first 30 minutes with that awful lineup. Wouldn't have deserved 3, but should have pulled it off after the penalty.

Took too long for subs in the 2nd half too, no one was good outside of maybe kepa, silva, chalobah.",Kai has been off the boil for a while.  He needs to sit for a bit and come back strong.,"If we could finish… some positive signs marred by poor finishing and some good saves by the city keeper. On to the weekend. KRBFFH

Got his tactics spot on, loved his passion and loved his post match interview... The glass is half full, we hosted a team tipped to be title challengers and we played them off the pitch, the referee has robbed us but we still played brilliantly","It isn’t 2 plus seasons, hasn’t been two. These aren’t the attackers he targeted except Sterling. 

Hard to discuss when you immediately want to be dishonest."
227,Why the fuck do we always look 2 men down in every facet of play?!,Hope I can get Chelsea in quarters and shove the 120 mil on Enzo's face.,Finally a win but Potter still not the right fit for our ambitions,"600m spent and trust me sterling pulisic and kai and even mount if you give him time is better than all these stupid signing. Madueke play with no brain, mudryk dribbling is shit. Said it before, mitoma is miles ahead of these player. The only good buy is enzo.

It seems like todd just buying player base on data with no fucking context like they did it in holland or ukraine against shit opponent. Like give me the top 10 player in this league like now according to dribbling stat or goal.","If only Potter had more passion we would've finished all those chances 😤

Sad that I need to include it but /s",Ziyech is truly a 99 times shit 1 time incredible player. Total waste of a body for 44 minutes every half he plays.,"I really don't think any current Chelsea players with a pride can respect Potter week in week out like this, everybody with a functional brain knows he`s clueless and out of depth, the owners have to have a back up plan lined up at this point, this is getting sad.",Mudryk looked sexy,Bro we need that Kerala Therapy that Tuchel was going through,"Zakaria and Fofana being capable of controlling the ball,and actually passing it to the intended recipient is the positives I'm looking at. Everything else was an absolute shambles.","KK plays like he is 21. Midfield is awful currently. Desperately need players back from injury. One bright spot today is Pulisic and Mount in the first half. Both making dangerous runs that would be picked out with a midfielder like Enzo. 

No way Sterling should start the next couple of games. Offers nothing in attack. 

What happened to the press? And where is the intensity?","Best performance we've had without James and Chilwell.

The key for me was no jorginho meant more transition, more end to end football and Zakaria allowed defensive stability even in transition. Potter got it so right in the 1st half but Pep is the GOAT after changing their dynamic with his 2 changes. Potter needed a response but we were hurt by the bench in terms of experience. 

I'm happy with that performance and hope it keeps Jorginho out of the 11 and makes a few think harder about their selection security.",,"Agree with all, this was despicable. But, the league leaders also looked pretty average and only scored one mediocre goal against us ... So there's a positive 🤷🏼‍♂️",Only watched last 30 min but yikes,Dear Lord our finishing is dreadful. Gallagher should have scored in the first half. Pulisic should have buried the rebound. Havertz made a good run and made great contact but his header was essentially right at the goalie. Pulisic rolls the ball across the edge of the six yard box while Sterling stands and watches.,I had absolutely zero faith we’d hold onto that lead. Seem to concede so many late goals in big games.,"Game felt flat, felt bored at parts and things didn't click

Kepa was great and got us a point there - so much more comfortable with his feet then Mendy",Don't forget good ole Mount,"Good spot, yeah I just don't see a player on the periphery like Pulisic being brought in for a big game.","Great effort from the Boys today, they really made the fans proud with their effort.",You're literally John Terry,Shhh can’t criticize Mount without being downvoted here,"very reminiscent of Mou's 4 atb in 14/15 where azpi was almost like an LCB allowing ivanovic to maraud forward, definitely intentional.","Lol this sub is extremely toxic. Imagine blaming a player who came on at the 80th minute for the draw, like the 80 minutes before said player it was all smooth sailing and nothing but goals. When Ziyech came on, it actually appears our chance creations doubled and our shots on target increased. He was unlucky with the keepers foot stopping the shot, but the dude was actually threatening and moved himself into good positions. Yet everyone here is acting like he played with his head between his legs. None of you seen the meme worthy ways Havertz controlled the ball and lost it on many occasions? Or how Mount once again was invisible? Or how Pulisic contributed absolutely nothing, literally? Is it because Ziyech is the ONLY brown dude out of this bunch of mediocre attackers? Cause I swear this level of scapegoating on him is beyond bias, it’s border-line sinister and creepy.","Disagree, a month ago this would have limped to a 0-0 at half that would have ended in a 0-1 with 94th minute goal by Giroud.

Both our wins have been less than convincing and came against two of weakest sides in the league, we were unlucky to draw against Spurs, but then we got spanked by fucking Leeds. A wins a win and in context of the game I'm more than happy with it but it doesn't allay any fears that we're still in for a shaky season.",Can we talk about Mount's lack of finishing lately?

The issue here is that he's laid out all of these plans (even to the point of benching/asking the board to hurry up and move on players that don't fit) and they've all been agreed upon, but it hasn't been actioned by the board yet. 



He wants the extra CB, he wants the extra CM so that we don't have to play RLC/Gallagher in a pivot and he wants a striker so that we don't have to play Havertz out of position there. 



He's been very open about this. The issue is not that he doesn't know what he wants, the issue is that it's all been laid out months ago and he's been working on it, but he is yet to get the personnel that he was promised would arrive before pre-season started. 



The issue here is that he's worked everything out and it's all been agreed upon, but he's in that limbo state of having the team set up to play this way, but still unsure as to whether he is going to get what he has been promised he would get to enable the system. 



As he said near the end of pre-season when asked about signings, maybe he'll have to rethink the way we play football after failing to get the signings that he was promised. He's already said that and I feel that any change of formation and system will come after the transfer window closes and we know for certain whether he will get what he was promised or not. I even wonder if the hold up in him signing the contract extension is because he doesn't believe he's being properly backed, we've got expensive signings but they're not the signings he asked for. It feels like Conte V2 could be in the offing if the end of the transfer window doesn't massively improve."

-Promising debut from Madueke. Played forward and pushed the ball into dangerous spots

-Cut the wasters. Ziyech is useless, play Madueke. Havertz is useless, play Fofana. Mount is useless, play Chukwuemeka

Hall, Carney, Hutchinson, and Gallagher all should be given more chances like there is nothing for us to lose if they can play fearlessly against city.

232,"Usually try to see the half glass full. Honestly, I try my best - I don't like coming out of any kind of match feeling like there was nothing. But there was absolutely nothing. 

Defense looked like a bunch of headless chicken every time. There's no clear transition to attack - on the first half the presenters I was listening to were amused about the fact that the team absolutely refused to play on one of the wings: not even an attempt.

Whenever our players got into their half they did the same - headless chickens. No clear plan: let's see what happens, maybe swarm the area, maybe a through ball - who knows! Maybe someone will shoot at the goal or something!

And whenever the ball was on our half it was an nightmare - they did whatever they wanted: the amount of pressure exerted on the penalty area was like watching a top-of-the-table first division team bully a mid-table second division one. The defense? ""Well, they're there, thanks for asking, we told them to run around all towards the same direction while watching the ball move from side to side.""

The score wasn't worse because of their inability of capitalising. This was tetric, there's no acceptable justification a manager can give for a performance such as this: there was nothing. Not one thing - even teams that are getting used to a style demonstrate some sort of progression. At least some sort of attitude, try to win the game through raw fury when tactics don't work out, but no.

Either the manager is having issues communicating his plan to the players or he has no idea of what he's doing; but there's no other spin. If this man cannot properly justify what he's doing and why it isn't working without restorting to an excuse he should have some self respect and leave the post. He's completely out of his depth.",Thought it was weird bringing pulisic on towards the end but I assume potter just wanted him to get some minutes coming back from injury.

Name me one player who looks better than prior to Potter coming in? Mount looks even worse than with the tail end of Tuchels time, Mudryk never ever gets the ball so I assume that's Potter tactical call, there is zero reason he gets ignored that much during the game, its shambolic. Enzo/Kova both looked mediorce, and then you have the team as a whole playing as if they're strangers. I've had enough.","Quick thoughts:

We need Pulisic back.  He's better than Mudryk.

We need Sterling back.  He's better than Ziyech.

We need Kante or Kona back.  Both are better than RLC.

Down 1-0 heading to the bridge in 3 weeks is not a bad situation.  We showed we are the better team today and were unfortunate not to get a W.",Why take Mudryk off?  We needed him in the second half. Ziyech looses possession with ambitious crosses too much. with him on the field we have no control of the game,"Tuchel had to go. Potter probably isn’t it, but Tuchel wasn’t either",Send chewbacca on loan he’s rubbing 2 huge chances and I don’t care he’s rubbish. the end,Hahaha best take.,"That's what happens when you have a bunch of CMs who can't dribble, aren't good when pressed, and can't create in attacking positions. We'll never score. Gallagher,Jorginho, Havertz, Azpi, Koulibaly all have to go. Mount should only get 150k otherwise he can go as well.","Every Chelsea poor performance should be blamed on the new ownership, 100% (successes as well but we aren't seeing any so far).

You don't spend over 250M pounds in the transfer window and fire the manager less than 2 weeks after your last arrival. It's poor management and ridiculously shortsighted. He got rid of players and purchased players for Potter before hiring him. 

If you had to fire Tuchel, do it BEFORE you go to the transfer market.",Hope we buy Zakaria. With a few aging or leaving midfielders he's starting to look like a good option to have.,,"They are celebrating like they won a fucking cup lol.

Anyway, felt like the team played really well. Just a shit goal for Arsenal sneaking in. Auba/Broja just had no delivery for any kind of chances today. I figured we'd get beat today, but 1-0 wasn't the score I had in mind. Thought we'd get a point after the first half.

Sucks to lose, but we move on.",I have to watch this another 24 times in the league? My god it gets harder each week. It is so uninspiring,"This gave me Chelsea 0 v Bournemouth 4 (Jan 2019)vibes. Gutless performance and completely dominated from the start.

Had so much time to take a touch and square it but took a shot instead. We'll always drop points in tights games until decision making improves. Our players are decent and Potter's game seems to be working fairly well. Players need to do better when making the final ball,"City really exploited the right side the entire game, RLC couldn't handle the gomez/grealish overloads and trevoh had to tuck in to help which left ample space for other city attackers.",Bring Eva back,"Not even an ounce of sympathy for TT from me tbh.

The only thing that frustrates a lot of fans is that level of consistency _between_ refs doesn't exist. So one game, Tomori can do that, and doesn't get punished for it. Next, he does.

Why does no ragrets get no game time?,"Can we just be pleased with a win, I don’t get why people think in our atrocious form that we would thrash any side bottom half or not, take the win and let’s see what happens against dortmund","Not even mad about this one. Southampton didn’t even come to play football. Would genuinely be surprised if we got 45 minutes of game time over the 90 today. We were still comfortably the better team, as frustrating as it was to watch at times. We’re also literally cursed with all these goal line blocks and balls not falling to feet","I’ve backed Havertz numerous times, maybe through sheer hopium rather than anything else, but I’ve seen enough now.

The likes of Chalobah or Gallagher who are obviously not good enough? Or maybe it's Zyiech who didn't look exactly the same under all the previous managers? Yeah Jorginho, Kovacic and Mount weren't great, but they're surrounded by players they never play with, you can't expect that to go well and blame it on desire if they don't manage to be at their level. 

This is the biggest transition period we've had for a very long time and I think everyone at the club knows it. Changing the manager one more time would just make things even worse.","We need Enzo, Rice, Belling, a new striker, fullback and Nkunku to join asap",And 62 million on a left back to have an academy midfielder play there better while the other academy lb is doing great on loan as well,,This is not the Chelsea I grew up watching. It’s actually official now we’ve fallen behind Arsenal as a club. Very sad day for the club. We look just as bad the last few weeks as we did at the end with Tuchel.,"We fucking suck ass. Embarassing how pathetic this team can be. Half the players need to go, this is atrocious football.","All I can say is so much for the best, most laid back and understated (in a good way) 3rd kit that Nike has delivered CFC to date… This loss is a result of lessons we have struggled to learn and the outcome had been a long time coming. 

Why are we debuting a 3rd kit in a PL match anyway?? You drop those against lesser CL Group or early Round FA/EFL Cup opponents.  

Remember when we got cute with the Nike 3rd kit in 20/21? Matchweek 3 vs West Brom. They scored in 4’, then following a Thiago Sliva miscue, they had a 2nd goal and followed with a 3rd just a couple of minutes later. Boom! We were 3-0 down in less than half an hour. On that day, we managed to wrestle back a late equalizer and brashly celebrated a Draw. 

BUT the Gods of Football had not spared us, only forestalled their wrath, as later that season, we took a 5-2 drubbing from WBAFC in the return leg of the tie. 

Because the Gods of Football don’t forget… And THAT is why it is most certainly bad juju to wear a 3rd kit in a PL match. Even if you think you have picked a match that doesn’t have a possible bugaboo element to it. Even if you carry the day, the affront to the GoF does not go unnoticed. 

In January of 2018, during our first season wearing Nike, we felt the need to wear it in a January PL match. Maybe it was because we were coming off of embarrassing back-to-back losses of 4-1  to Watford and 3-0 to Bournemouth. Maybe it’s because our upcoming opponent was an insignificant club who had just returned to the top-flight that season after a 34 year absence. Maybe it was because at the time, only 3 other PL clubs besides CFC (5th Place) were wearing Nike. Manchester City (1st Place), Tottenham Hotspurs (3rd Place), and these PL new boys languishing just above the relegation zone who had signed on with Nike while in the Championship. 

So we put on our first-ever Nike 3rd kit to a PL match… and we thumped them, as expected, in dominating fashion, with goals coming in 3’, 77’ (Hazard), 6’ (Willian), and an 89’ demoralizer (Victor Moses) en route to a 4-0 statement of a 3rd kit win. 

That PL debutante, whipping boy of a club that we flexed our 3rd kits on was of course Brighton & Hove Albion and they have been in the PL ever since, waiting, along with the Gods of Football for us to casually throw on another 3rd kit and stroll onto the pitch to face them. 

I don’t think even the GoF could have could have concocted a scenario in which we would make that unfortunate wardrobe miscalculation just over a month after we had raided BHAFC and made off with their manager, members of their coaching staff, their reigning Player of the Season, and key members of their front office staff. When you think about it, it’s a wonder everyone got out of there alive.",Chelsea didn't deserve three points. Even after Potter got the midfield sorted we were still toothless in attack.

No matter who we play, no matter their form. They know they can dig in and have a good chance of getting a result against Chelsea. It's been a problem that Tuchel faced as well.

Maybe before Chelsea thinks about offloading underperforming players (Mount), they should look at the management who's playing him wildly out of position.

My final thoughts: Is it right to sack Potter now?

The *only* thing making me think that sacking Potter now would be wrong is that I'm not sure any manager could come in during the season and give this team confidence infront of goal. Might be best to stick with him until the summer and then change things.",Enzo is the greatest thing that happened to Chelsea this season.,The Conferente league dream os alive!,">I'm yet to really see him take a game on and make some bold decisions when we have many games that are so clearly there to be won be some brave tactical adjustments. 

Thats why, for me, this is his last game to ""prove it"".  Champions League is the be all and end all, he needs to show he has the minerals to succeed at this level.  He can do all the experimenting he wants in the PL this season but CL needs to be where he shows his real qualities as a coach.

Mount has to start doing better or sit out for some time.

Gallagher does good sometimes but then does so much wrong, so irritating.

Badiashile was good, Hall should never play one of the deep Pivot in 2 man mid. Ziyech was good, but we need much more than one single move from the right to be more threatening as a team.

I would say again that Havertz needs to face a reality check by being benched for some weeks or so. Dude literally does not offer anything in both phases of the game. It will be ludicrous and a sabotage to see him start next game. 

Jorginho will always take forever to find his man in the build-up. No athleticism, no agility, no shooting ability, no passing range, no aggression. He's just not suitable for the EPL any longer.

237,The Instagram page only posted a story for the full time post. I’m sure they did this to prevent all the #potterout hashtags,with absolutely nothing to lose we need to be this agressive in every game. i liked what i saw tonight.,Arsenal last minute winner,"Relax, you plastic fans. Trust the process. Look at Arteta! Look at Arsenal!","I always have such high hopes for Ziyech but then end up so disappointed bc he makes so many poor crosses, makes bad decisions, and in general doesn’t actually produce anything in the end. Is that too harsh or does anyone else feel that way too?","To whom it may concern, please do not waste your time with any “Potter-Out” nonsense. He’s not going anywhere and it’d be incredibly stupid to get rid of him. 

It’s very simple, Potter has a history of building success over long periods of time. He needs a squad that recognizes his system, and can commit to it. 

He does not have that squad at the moment. The starting 11 is replete with should-be-backups and fresh faces. Give him Enzo, Mudryk, Felix, as well as a full return of our important pieces like James, Kante, Kovacic… even Pulisic and Chillwell. Give that team time, and I PROMISE you it will get better. 

That being said, Potter is not doing himself any favors. Despite the new faces, despite the injuries, the team today was more than good enough to beat Fulham. Potter needs time, but he desperately needs to improve right now as well.

The biggest mistake he routinely makes is who he chooses to give minutes. Mount/Havertz need either a role change or an EXTENDED time on the bench. Cucu needs to be reminded that he has competition for his position, especially with Chillwell returning. Ziyech needs to be reminded that he’s not going to PSG yet, and is on the bottom of the ladder for our winger depth. Gallagher needs to be reminded that this is the f***ing Premier League and Potter owes him nothing. 

Is Potter underwhelming so far? Yes. Is Potter going to get better? Also yes. Is the roster in a transitional phase that’s still dealing with injuries to key players? Are the individual players not helping Potter by giving regularly dull, boring performances? Also yes","Yeah, Potter's gotta go.

I still maintain my opinions up until now. Potter deserved time, he deserved to avoid heavy judgement through the period of injury crisis, and to have couple of games to settle in the new players and restore players from injury. He's had all of that now.

We no longer have an injury crisis. We're missing a couple of key players but we can't fall apart when 1 or 2 positions aren't at full strength. The new signings have had time to settle. They're playing well, they look good, but it's not working. I really wanted Potter to succeed and I sincerely hope he does well wherever he goes next because he seems like a decent bloke, but I've had enough now. With our current list of players and proven willingness to spend, there must be a top class manager willing to join us in the summer at least.","I really want to see Havertz in that 10 spot, so he can have some space.

Gallagher isn’t the best at dribbling so I’d stick him down the right where James can instead provide the width and move RLC to the left side with cucurella.",This but with Broja,why is azpi starting along with silva there? i just dont get any logic with this club at all atm. Now we have Potter trying to instill his tactics in the middle of the most important games of the season. When we didnt even play jorgi/kova 3-4-3 once this season. Didnt even give Tuchel a chance. So frustrated.,Cmon bruh both teams just waiting for the game to end asap,"Yeah but even without giving the penalty no one would care, even i didn't think it is a penalty, i mean no one even reacted. The red card came as a shock to everyone tbh.",,another spineless performance. sigh....,"I struggle to be happy with that. 3 points I know, and Fofana was good, but man Mendy needs to wake up.",,Azpi coming on was huge for us,What the actual fuck,"With the current midfielders available and with no striker, there is no system in the world that will make us look good. The system isn't the problem, the personnel is."
238,"Absolutely fucked it. After all those new signings. Same old shit. Fire this manager and give us a good one. But too fucking late, no top 4 or UCL",Up the Chels what a win,What are these substitutions? 2 wingers out for 2 CM’s as soon as we are winning. Such a bad mentality for us. He must go,It’s time for the Special One. No two ways about it.,"We was actually good today, away in Europe and to a solid team. Played so nice football and had a really good flow to our play just need to sort out the finishing big time.",Gallagher is such a terrible player.,Just doesn't look/feel like an elite manager in any aspect.," João Félix  & Mudryk instantly our best attackers within 5mins of walking on the pitch in each match. Its a shame that the rest of the squad were letting these guys down and not keeping up with the pace or falling over. Cant stand our non-technical midfield of Gallagher and Mount as we dont release the ball fast enough and keep committing stupid fouls!

Defensively solid however.",I thought he was a nailed on starter for today and that is one thing Potter did have control over,He just sounds so mad all the time. Like he doesn't want to be there lol something he has in common with a number of out players, Fuck-me-sideways.,">Probably Zakaria's best game for us

Maybe the best individual performance this season",,"I feel like potter is making some of the same mistakes as Tuchel.

I know he's hamstrung a bit by injuries at the moment, but man, we've played mount out of position and had no one worry that back line all day, and the one guy with a bit of pace and trickery on the bench is Pulisic, so give him more than 10 minutes to have a crack. And why take Mount off for him? Both number 10's on the bench, now we've got no one in between the midfield and forwards. Gallagher's not the man for that, he's an 8 not a 10.

I don't know who does those ratings but Havertz was no way a 6.9, he made a few good runs but otherwise put in little effort, looks extremely unfit, was soundly beaten and outfought all day and looked exhausted after 30 minutes.

Again, i know we have injuries but some of Potter's changes and tactical decisions are as bad as some of Tuchel's (not his worst ones atleast), but it's really starting to worry me now. I mean, i know we've bitch slapped Milan a couple of times in there as well, but in the league our 3 wins have come as a fluke against Palace, and 2 of the bottom 3. Since then, 4 straight poor performances, including never really being in this one and a pretty deserved humbling from Brighton.

And now we've got a red hot toon next weekend... the world cup break can't come soon enough",Rough spell for sure. Hopefully the break lets us heal up and sort some stuff out.,"Can he still beat defender in 1-on-1 ?? Never see his speed ever again, and that his best trait.",Where was the goal line technology view for the Manu goal?,These games frustrate me the most. These are suppose to be easy wins but we draw. Other big 6 clubs take advantage and cruise to a win while we struggle and draw. Feels like we lost 2 points here.,"Thank you. Relatively speaking we played ""well"", but translation: the players tried a bit harder this game.

City barely got out of first gear, and when they did they put the game to bed in a very short space of time without the lethal combination of KDB and Haaland. The way they were playing through us without those two means we'd have been more fucked if they were playing as well.

It is encouraging that we did at least create some chances though. It's rare to see that from us in recent months, i don't care who we're playing or how hard they're working.",Until they get a tough draw and get knocked out.,Time to start thinking about managers,No it was pulisic with a back heel to keep the possession in the box. Then it hit off Havertz and a defender,Was it? Thought the intensity and pace in the game really dropped in the 2nd half,r/copypasta,Finally something constructive… compared to all the whining here (not sure if they know the game),lmao what a sad comment,Theo didn't play the first game. He's arguably the best lb at the moment.,,Start. Broja. And. Reece. Vs. West. Ham.,What are we gonna do about Mendy?,,Massive 3 points especially from a man down. They finally showed some composure and the ability to face adversity after the last 2 weeks. Good performance overall they defended like mad men,I pray the worst happens to Anthony Taylor,"It's not so much a surprise as it is a reluctant acceptance. We were always gonna be bad,  as this season was always a rebuild.  The rebuild won't be complete this windows,  probably not in the winter either.  There's always next year"

Eventually we were going to get lucky with a set piece, but if you can’t understand that this team is no better, I don’t know what to tell you.","Yeah…I was being patient until today, there is no excuses for todays result, they had to win, instead Southampton was the best team in the first half, they even had the most possession ffs, in the second half they defended very well, we created chances sure but it would be impossible not to.

Very good game against BVB and then this, probably because BVB is a very attacking side maybe too much for their liking, but the moment this team faced a team a bit more consistent defensively they had difficulties again.",I think Werner had better attitude than Havertz and Ziyech,https://preview.redd.it/9nhld6uq83ga1.jpeg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b7eef3c60f7d4dc11b2d14ee5be6ae40e9b24d68,Seriously.  Avram Granr had the personality of a potato and even *he* could inspire more passion then that wet mop Potter.,"Negatives: Mason is struggling, Gallagher lacked finesse as the game progressed, Hall a little sloppy, Cucu gets baited too often, Chuky too unfocused, Auba is Auba.

Neutrals: Jorghino decent but could’ve involved himself more, Chalobah solid but needed a bit too much assistance on the right, Havertz okay performance but lacks explosiveness 

Positives: Silva good as always, Ziyech most threatening player on the pitch, Kepa very calm and focused, Badiashile is Silva’s son, Mudryk very promising","Not only has he earned it, but at this point, who the hell else can even play? Team has more injured players than active players lol","Feel the same. Most untalented, unlikeable bunch of misfits I can remember in over 20 years at this club.

Hate watching us play. There isn’t an ounce of creativity and no fucking hope of creating chances","A lot of our forwards aren't anything better than what mid table clubs like villa and Brentford have. They are just not good enough. We need to find a way of getting rid of guys like Pulisic, Auba and ziyech next summer. We play too safe and don't want to take risks due to certain players not being comfortable enough to receive balls in small spaces. Wingers can't dribble or out run their markers. We aren't aggressive enough when we lose the ball and reaction to second balls is remarkably slow. Too many of our players aren't good enough and I won't mention some names because people her will eat me alive but this is where we are as a team right now.",Tbf Tuchel had a massive boner for auba and he has been disinterested from day one.,,Potter’s gonna get ran out before he gets a chance isn’t he,I know we were shit but goddamn newcastle are unbearable. After scoring that goal there was no football and those tackles were pretty concerning towards the end.,He hasn't beaten anyone since he's come. Awful signing for now.,we still have a sub left and we let them score at stoppage time instead of dragging it out.,"Chelsea fan  in anticipation of the upcoming ManU match

![gif](giphy|10o3Um2U3wa4DK)",That offsides goal at the end was amazing in a way...,Potter said they were holding him out of the squad cuz of his knee injury so it's unlikely he is keeping his fitness up like he would normally so I think a full 90 10 days ago being the last time he played a full 90 could make a difference.,"Yeah, Tuchel deserves every bit of flak coming his way after this. A ridiculously high transfer window and this is the dross we get.



Credit to Zagreb. They totally nullified us and deserved the win.","Havertz had the assist but Pulisic made the challenge in the box that causes the ball to deflect to Havertz. Without that challenge, Salzburg clears it out and no goal is scored.",Reactive asshats,"This pasta never gets old. Was used on Mason. Then on Kai after we won the UCL. Fitting for Conor too. I also remember this being used for Goretzka.

Heck, I even saw this used for CumDawg (Pat Cummins, Australian cricketer). Cracks me up every single time.","My heart goes out to the guy in the pre-match thread that bet £4k on Chelsea winning. 

I feel shit but he must be on his knees",He came on 5 minutes after the 3-0 goal. The main goal wasn’t to put in a 4th you doorknob.,in fact these are the type of games we would have bottled last year that we are winning comfortably now,,"We need the transfer window to close, I think too many players are thinking about other options/incomings and it’s impacting the team.

It’s mad we have left this so late, I would be phoning Ajax now and halving the Ziyech price and throwing in Pulisic.","CHILLYYYYYY ❤️❤️Thank God we got lucky and got all 3 points.

Lots to improve on, but a win is a win.",,"tommy pls, i just want a stressfree easy weekend watching my team.

that was mega sweaty",Fucking awful officiating,"To be fair, we deserve 6 points so far and that puts us pretty close to an 80 point pace. But what we saw today doesn’t inspire consistency or optimism especially based on level of competition. I wouldn’t sleep on Leeds though, but they will get battered by teams who can finish and knock them off their press. We had our chances to do that but then folded like a cheap table."
240, Potter stans come outside & defend yourself,What a performance from Chilly tonight. Him and Reece on the wings is Chelsea football at its finest. Great win Chels,💙 finally a win … still potter's not right fit for chelsea,"Potter isn’t going anywhere so it’s moot anyway but which manager is even available that you’d have confidence in? What does it do the team, could it get even worse or would any new manager breathe life into the team? We’re stuck between a rock and a hard place, I’ll always support the team but morale is rock bottom"," I think that may have been one of the most unfair results I've seen from us in a long time. Dortmund didn't deserve even a point out of that and they score off one counter-attacking chance from a fucking corner. We dominated them thoroughly and Kobel decided to become prime Yashin. Special mention to the ref who was fucking dreadful and made the game 10x harder due to his inability to do his job properly. Like how did Bellingham stay on the pitch? How did Can stay on the pitch? Spineless refereeing if you ask me.

Oh and those of you calling for Potter out, leave my club, you utter plastic. You don't deserve to watch Chelsea play. You are a bunch of spineless little rats who've just started supporting the club this year. It is clear that if you're calling for him to be gone that you haven't been watching this game and how hard the task has been for Potter. We showed immense improvement away at Dortmund of all places. On to the home fixture, we're gonna smash the sorry cunts! KTBFFH!","The key message from this game, the last few games, and the rest of the season: Rome wasn’t built in a day.

The comments in the match thread are so hyper-reactive, reading like the ramblings of a drunk Abrahamovich. If we sack Potter right now (like many were calling to do) who should we get? The players who aren’t good enough will still be not good enough, the new players won’t magically become integrated into the squad, our injuries won’t go away etc. people seem to have quickly forgotten that we were playing shit under Tuchel at the end and people were calling for us to hire Potter.

Contrary to the doom and gloom, you can see the improvement in the team, Badiashille looks like a successor to Silva, a truly solid CB. Enzo in midfield looked very good, when he’s got someone better alongside him (whether that he Kante/Kovacic or a new singing) we will be truly formidable in the middle of the pitch. Madueke was exciting, RJ and Chilly are back and building up their minutes. 

It’s undeniable that Havertz, Mount and Gallagher aren’t up to par, that’s who we have until the summer, constantly complaining about them won’t make them any better, nor would sacking Potter.  Havertz especially is playing out of position, he tries but he’s not good enough, that’s fine when the summer comes we can look at moving him on. 

People call themselves Chelsea fans but spend their entire time dooming about the team, it’s embarrassing, if we want a team to play with confidence and purpose, the least we can do is support them and give them time.","Yeah first half shows what we can be capable of with new signings. Second half was a lot of ""old Chelsea"" game plan from the end of Tuchel which we need time to get rid of.

Potter will get the time but today was just miserable.",Mount and Gallagher needs to benched immediately. Get Gallagher out of the club too.,Watch him get benched for Mount on the wing. I love Mount but he is out of form and isn't a winger,But thats all Potter’s fault amirite ?,Yes let's not have any expectations this season and try to enjoy whenever we play good. The collective team chemistry will click one day and it's only upwards from there.,"We also have no Kante, Ben, Reece, or any form of a elite striker or a creative midfielder. This season is a complete write off we just need to get the right players in and plan for the future.",,"It maybe an unpopular opinion but British managers (barring Sir Alex) have never been at the same level as continental ones.. even of the calibre of Howe or Potter. I've no idea what Toddfather was thinking gettin rid of TT..and even if he had to, not get someone from the continent.",sigh....see you guys in late december,He has been for a long time now.,"I always forget how reactionary some fans are.
People saying Potter is not it. This is the core of our problem at chelsea. We dump on people if they have a bad game. Kepa wins us the last 2 games and now people are like 'mendy'
Potter needs time, just look at brighton at the start. Chelsea are a big project due to how quickly we've cycled managers and have a team of 3 different managers. 
Let him build and let the players learn the system.",why does havertz play so much better for germany. someone pls explain,And their keeper was excellent,"As much as I agree with you. Chilwell would have offered a different alternative being much better in a wingback set up if Southgate ever bothered to research other tactical set ups. 

Shaw would’ve started ahead of Chilwell but Ben would’ve been a nice addition. Sadly now, that won’t happen.","RM lost to Sheriff last season, right? Things like this happen in transition. Klopp had a terrible 2020/21 season. Pep’s team were way behind Klopp’s title winning team. Buckle in for a long ride, but Tuchel should be trusted. Elite managers are rare. We can’t go back to Roman times.","Puli won the ball back to Kai, then Kai’s touch hit off a defender to Kova",Mount seems so rattled recently. He loses his head so often committing unnecessary fouls. Think a game or two from the bench will do him good and hopefully recover his form.,"I love this pasta, Cumdog or Conor it just fits",WE WANT TUCHEL,He came on to see the game out it’s what he does best,"Like for real, sometimes sitting back and managing the game is actually the best option.",,"This is why we play 5 atb.

433 would be fun but we can’t defend.",Broja should be starting and Chilly next game,,"If Kovacic is healthy, we should play him over Gallagher. 

Don't know whether he's nervous or over-excited to play in Chelsea jersey but Gallagher's performance these past 2 games was not good. No accuracy in the pass, too indecisive in positioning and passing, not tackling or pressing well and playing rashly too. 

I wish Kante is not injured so we can play Gallagher in FA or Carabao first but since we're so thin in CM (yeah we have many names but their track record is not good either, including RLC as CM).  

Let's see how TT solves this issue because if we don't have any stability and confidence in the midfield, then we'll have a difficult season. 

If only we sign FDJ. But unfortunately FDJ and his wife really love Barca for whatever reasons.",Disgusting robbery.,"This is why I dont like 3-4-3 

It overloads the wings but leave no one in the mid 


Only good for counter attacking play as we did when we won the league and ucl 


When we are gonna be in possession, I think we should play 4-2-3-1

I don’t see another manager out there,If I was enzo I would have two footed adeyemi and taken the red just to avoid the goal. Then we could have parked the bus and came out with a draw just to avoid defeat,"I don't understand why anyone keeps thinking Potter isn't the problem yet. Every other coach has come in with less time to get things going. Besides the Champions League, Potter has no other tournaments to worry about to get his team ready. And they still look inconsistent despite having 10 days off and not having to worry about the FA or EFL Cup.

&#x200B;

Fact of the matter is the owner and board screwed up firing Tuchel. He got that team turned around, and kept them winning with the transfer windows locked out due to violations. Potter at this point has a 100 guys, and he still can't get a win or score. It's pathetic at this point, and he is clearly not ready for primetime like Moyes hasn't been for a decade now.",If we give potter next season that means we miss champions league 2 years in a row after spending 600m,Gallaghar is so shite in attack.,Crazy that I can wrap my head around this statement.,"Like if this doesn't happen im baffled. Kai attitude fucking stinks.

Carney also needs to stay every week now as well, same with Zakaria. 

Build the 11 around those and see what happens but fuck me this is embarrassing, new lows have been reached. 

Fans were entertaining themselves, that is when you know its shite",We won this game if we have Casemiro on Defensive Midfield,"Gallagher's ambition is insane, he's a proper chels no doubt but I still find him playing too raw, he's not technical enough and has a questionable decision making. 

However he has the potential to improve, and I'm convinced he will, he strikes me as a guy who just never gives up",,At the end of the day sir Roman abramovich would never let this happen,Somebody forgot to tell Chelsea that to score you actually have to attack.,arsenal clearly got the better player from arsenal,"Have to give credit to Potter for changing it in the fridge half, we were getting totally overrun. Worrying about Cucurella though, can't half feeling that 60mil would have been better spent on a CB, he looks woefully out of his depth.

Would have liked to seen Sterling hooked a bit earlier, poor again tonight.

Sickener to lose it at the end but overall a draw probably fair result.","Extremely disappointed, in kai especially. hope he comes back stronger","Avram Grant took us to the Champions League final and 2nd place in the Premier League, 2 points below United in the table.","Chilwell couldn't play for England during the euros.

Abramovich in, Tuchel in.","Re Pulisic.

I think it speaks volumes when various managers continue to overlook him for playing time. Whether this is Potter maybe keeping him fresh for Wolves I don't know, otherwise it could indicate that Potter wants players who contribute more towards game in general areas rather than just in specific moments - which lends itself to what Pulisic mainly is as a player. Maybe he doesn't train well and that plays a part in it all as well? Who knows.

As you said though he's not a strong player, but he's also not overly varied in his game either. If he can't dribble and beat players then he doesn't add a whole lot else, given his passing, decision making, and crossing tend to be pretty subpar a lot of the time. 

For me his role in the side is as it should be, an impact sub that might start the odd game here and there when we need a bit of rotation.","I understand in last 10/15 mins or so

But why not play our normal game up until then.

I am extremely angry about Tuchel and the football he plays, but first, let these transfers be settled",Our guy Chilly is back. Fofana impressive. Jorginho sloppy as usual there at the end. I have a hard time giving fault to our attackers because when they receive the ball and turn there is nothing in front of them but 3 defenders. Can’t expect them to dribble past everyone. 2 wingers up top is confusing but they both held onto the ball. Broja deserves a run of games.,,"I know it's over when Rodgers pulled out Tielemans. Nice move lol. Btw, does anyone rate Tielemans at all? The team can really use his killer passes and long shots.","As ever, fuck Anthony Taylor.

Potter might not be the answer long term, but we're all going to find out, one way or another. Rebuild is starting, and the players in the squad will be phasing out over the next two years.

I can't imagine how frustrated I would be seeing him sacked from my club the season after he wins the CL, nevermind who was replacing him.
 I sense trouble ahead with this Boehly guy. That was a wild decision to make. These long contracts too, and spending so much so early into his ownership, it all seems like a guy who thinks he's smarter than he is.

Garbage midfield will not provide anything to him.,"Poor performance from the midfield and attack. Neither of which is able to hold on to ball. Just 1 shot (Aubameyang) all second half is unacceptable. 

Said this earlier this season. This team still remains spineless despite the occasional glimpse of excellence. 

Koulibaly: Saying he was dreadful is a euphemism. Another CB(Badiashile) is essential 

Azpilicueta: I can't fathom how we expect Azpi to fill in, even if as a back-up RB, talk less a RWB. Man has literally lost his legs and mojo for the past season. Not letting him go to Barca last summer, and not prioritizing the RB. No disrespect to him, but extending him was a joke. 

Jorginho: I find it baffling how we've been so reliant on Jorginho for the past couple of seasons. His play is quite predictable and has been found out. He is a twerp, doesn't offer much in attack and in defence as well. A physically weak player has no reason to be found in Chelsea considering the level of the league's intensity and physicality. He doesn't possess a significant level of creativity or pace to compensate for the aforementioned weakness. If he extends with us (for more than a year), I don't see that as a way forward. Kante also needs to go considering his durability. 

Gallagher: A poor 20 minutes cameo. Expected much much more from him due to his impressive loan at the Saint Mary's. Need to work more on his possession and positioning. Decision making is inadequate and ineffective. 

Zakaria: Culpable for a lot of lost possession. If he doesn't improve by the end of the season, he should return to Juventus. 

Pulisic: I am sorry Americans, but he's been actually appalling except for his first season (this is his fourth season). No strength or balance on the ball. Offer little in dribbling or creativity. Easily bullied and harried off the ball. Very little pressing offered as well. 

Sterling: Raheem is definitely on the decline before the CL final. Wasn't really a fan of his arrival while we can actually invest in young, quick and agile wingers. Saying he was underwhelming is a flattery. 

Havertz: We shouldn't be too attached to exempt him from constructive criticism just because of a goal. Learnt few days ago here that he's leading the team in fouls committed; the most forward player for a majority of the games. Poor decision making. Doesn't offer much in link-up phase and in the box. Can't wait to have Broja back in business. 

Potter: Couldn't have done a lot tactically, except for the Ziyech/Kovacic sub which came a bit late. 

I hope we can sort all these problems in 6 months or so and start afresh a new era fully.

A new RB, DM, (left-footed) winger(s) and creative midfielder, all with evident durability and fitness are needed.",My only concern is that Silva will eventually dip like Kante and then everyone in this sub will be baying for his blood too,,"Alright, let’s go silver lining with it. 

That was liberating. The pressure is off now. We know that this squad isn’t going anywhere. We’re going to have to blow it up and start over with an actual recruitment plan. Thankfully, we have an owner who’s willing to spend, so if we’re smart about signings, we could be competing again in two windows. 

Now it’s a matter of determining who stays. For me, it’s almost nobody. Broja has shown some desire, I think Mount can still come good, and Reece is obviously one of the best in the world when he’s on the pitch. It might just be those three. I love Kova, but his body can’t handle a full season, and he can’t be relied upon as an everyday core player.","I’m done, I wont be watching any more Chelsea matches for at least a month.

Quite shocking that we are picking up so many though. Especially when so many have looked innocuous as fuck. That Zakaria one comes out of nothing, what are they doing that a cross field ball injures a player.",May as well. We aren't playing for anything this season. Give the youngsters some time and let's see what we got for next season.,"Wish you plastic fans would take a fucking hike and go support someone else if you have nothing positive to say.

Rebuilding the team will take several years. We knew this would be a multi-year process, and yet “fans” still lose their heads when we lose a game.

Am I happy about today’s result? No. But you won’t see me calling to sack Potter or hating on the club.

Some of you are no better than Lukaku.",Cucu is a great backup. He's definitely not 65 mil worth but he's more than capable backup for chillwell,,"Man, reading these comments what were you guys expecting from this game?? We all knew a tie was the best we could hope for in our current state and we very nearly got that. The boys fought but it was a losing battle from the outset. The boundless negativity from Chelsea fans is making me depressed right now not the team.",Mason Mount is just another guy.,Too bad they’ll continue to be awful and their manager will be sacked next summer,"Honestly feel that last season with our injuries we would have lost this game by the first half. So while I’m not impressed I’m not that upset either. Potter is suffering from Tuchel’s indecision to improve the midfield. On the other hand though, Tuchel was also concerned about our defense and we see why too. I just hope we can make it to the next games before the World Cup and at least secure the group stage. KTBFFH","For me it was Fabian Schär. 

It turned out okay, but I need to be better about looking after benching my captain.",They were also playing world class players all over the pitch lmao. They had plenty of starters who would make our best 11,And he was benched today,"Tommy Tactics needs some results and soon. I still like him and support him personally, but man we just cannot keep playing like this, something’s gotta give.",puli then kai then kova for the golazo,"What about Sterling and Auba? Both were completely INVISIBLE through the entire game, apart from the equalizer.","Actually you have decent competition from his girlfriend, preety and living proper Instagram life chick","How much of an impact do you expect Ziyech to realistically make in 10-15 minutes? He came on, had 3 decent chances in succession, got himself into good positions. He, like the rest of the players, deserve at least some time to settle into this new tactical system and what Potter is asking of the players in relation to what they’re used to.",First time anybody has looked “toothless” against us in awhile though.,That’s like calling Chelsea “FC”,,"Loftus Cheek played well, but the system with Jorginho was confused and no one filled those dangerous spaces that a proper DM naturally would. One proper DM and those goals can’t be scored.

I cannot stress enough how shambolic Kovacic and Pulisic were. Pulisic looked like an U11s player. Weak. Slow. Gave it away. He was getting bullied. Kovacic was often happy to sit alongside the defenders while huge gaps opened up in the actual midfield. No matter, though, when he did decide to play his position, he either went back, side, or gave it away. I’d rather two red cards than sub them on in current form.

Broja looked good when the ball was (briefly) in the vicinity of him.",Kepa starts next Prem game?,,"Can't wait to see the squad full strength with Fofana in the back 3, Reece back at wingback and Kante (occasionally) healthy. Conor is a step behind as of now and is better off as a rotation piece. Glad to have Kova back


Forwards/Midfielder reinforcements will probably have to wait until next summer (except maybe Aubamayeng who might still get done this window) but I see the vision","We got absolutely robbed on both of those goals. Absolute dog shit by Antony Taylor. Like that’s shocking.

Edit: What fucking game we’re these commentators watching? Spurs looked like shit for all but 10 minutes, and both goals were a gift from the official.","I find it quite funny when people say our players can’t play 433 because it doesn’t suit them. Our 2 CBs who struggled in a back 4 have left the club this summer.

We will need to build on this as no doubt we will be playing against a tougher opponent next round and as good as we were tonight there is still plenty of improvement to be made.

I hope we can give some game time to Mudryk in the premier league, i understand why he hasn't played in must-win games but i really want to see what he can do.","When will this Kai experiment end ? It already has led to two manager sacks and a third one is on the brink. Just give DDF a run of games, what’s the worse that can happen","Potter just needs more time, in the sunmer Lukaku is coming back and Potter will have his 9","2 years ago Lampard had us 6th or thereabouts and a CL exit looked all but certain. Roman pulled the trigger and the rest was history.

2 years later we are in an even worse position and are now halfway through a CL Ro16 exit. If Boehly wants to see success he’s going to have to be ruthless like Roman was, because sometimes projects. don’t. work.","The usual suspects this season - Mount, Ziyech, Havertz, Cucurella - were piss poor again. Admittedly thought Havertz was better when they moved him back but can’t imagine you’d play him there over Felix. 

Massive plus to get some time in the legs of Chilwell and James, wish we could’ve seen more than 5 minutes for Chilly but the staff know best. Hope nothing serious for Mudryk. Thought Madueke and Sterling looked lively - they seem to fit how Potter wants to play much more than Ziyech who has a left foot cross and nothing else. Badiashile and Silva, very good. Kepa too. 

Disappointing result but an enjoyable match and really enjoyed watching Enzo. Will be nice to see how he goes playing with Kovacic/Kante and even Zakaria, hopefully in the not too distant future. Dreadful to see how badly Mason Mount has dropped off.","Potter plays a beautiful style but again this is Chelsea we’re results based, and Potter has a huge flaw of Chelsea crumbling in the second half",Yawn,"I think they need to be looking at the training staff, not the medical one.

But he's not gonna fix anything alone.",Worse month of football in 6 years. Bring Tuchel back,"Maybe he had to give RLC some halftime instruction on how to play as a RB? Probably a good amount of detail to how he needed players to play in the 2nd half formation.

As ass as Mount has been as an outfield player, Mendy’s been similar in net.",As a Chelsea and Yankees (baseball for non-🇨🇺🦅 folks) fan this hit home for me,We're so garbage... god damn...,"True but they looked pretty strong early until the series of corners where they couldn't mark Silva and it led to the Fofana goal. Then they looked ready to equalize at the end of the break and looked strong to start the second half until we scored. 

I think they looked toothless because we imposed our will on them and it took the wind out of their sails.","It's clearly stated in the rules that that's a clear red and pen, he denied a clear goal scoring opportunity while not trying to play for the ball. The ref was clearly favoring you before the pen giving you 2 very soft free kicks when Kova won the ball and Theo dived but I did not hear you complain about it as it was favoring you, now you choose to be a hypocrite just cause Tomori screws you by doing that.",,Jorginho is the worst thing to happen to this club. Tuchel needs to stop starting this idiot. And pulisoc is the second worst thing to happen to this club. Enough of this garbage,"Take the 3 points and fucking run. We have some big issues.

Evertime we did well with 4-3-3 we had players like Makelele and Essies 

Kante has been declining as DM, especially since Sarri played him upfront 

So, if we want to play 4-3-3 we gotta find players like Essien, Makelele, and Matic 

Even Matic worked out during 4-2-3-1 and 3-4-3 

4-3-3 with no proper DM would lead to an embarassing defeat like 6-0 against City. 


But still, I hope Tuchel plays 4-2-3-1 

Put 2 mids and let them play half pitch and deep in defence. 

Let two wing backs overlap

And put 1 amf 

2 wingers

And 1 striker

Auba for 60 mins. These guys couldn’t hold on to the ball for half a second. Was complete disaster. There is just one game to go before the break. Bring on Kova, Connor, Pulisic at half time. Utter non sense","Don't even know what to say or think. It just keeps on getting worse and worse. I know we gotta back the manager but if Cheslea doesn't get top 4 or get to CL, Potter gotta be sacked. No questions asked. Yea cycling through managers isn't good. I genuinely thought Tuchel would be our SAF or Wenger but if Boehly is gonna fire Tuchel for his poor start to the season, then the same has to be done for Potter.",Wonder if the pressure of returning to his old team got to him,"Potter and the scouting team got it wrong today in many different ways at the off. Man Utd played within their expected system, and Potter's formation and personnel had multiple questionable-at-best calls to counter, which played out poorly in many game phases. Potter had courageous and sufficient in-game management to get out of the hole he had dug, but even then it felt he could have done more.

Utd were expected to play with 3 midfielders, so why choose to go in with only 2? RLC & Jorgi are our most defensively suspect options, so why choose to pair them together, especially when expected to be outnumbered in midfield. This double dose reflects extremely poorly on Potter's planning. Farcical. 

Selecting Cucurella and Chilwell together locked us into a 3atb setup. I like the pair on the field together for certain situations, but this setup was naive when we would be conceding numbers in midfield.

Selecting Auba and Sterling together seemingly prioritized speed and carrying ability. Given the lack of midfield control, I don't hate this concept.  I would have preferred some 2 of Auba, Broja, and Havertz to bully Martinez in the air though, especially when we were setup not to press and offensively go direct.

There were many ways to address the issue(s), and while Kova as a sub was an effective one, it was confusing because he wasn't fit enough to start. Going to a 3 removed the advantage, Kova had a decent game without getting hurt, and Potter showed boldness with the early decision, so fair play to that. I'm glad we got the point, but not sure we fully deserved it. Setting up the team poorly is becoming a trend with Potter, which I rarely saw during his Brighton tenure. Strange datapoint for our new manager.","Pulisic, Auba, Sterling mins >",So then you lads understand this is not about potter then?,Zagreb are known for causing upsets in Europe,Ziyech with literally the worst half of football I've ever seen. Offered absolutely nothing and we'd have been better off with 10 men.,It wasn't a simple lay off pass. He kept possession while 3 defenders marked him which created space for Kai.

On the other…plz no europa😭","I agree they were also missing 4 key starters and if Theo Hernandez was on that left hand side with Leao I think we would have struggled way more also Milan basically had no left sided winger since both of their options were injured along with their starting keeper, we played them at a great time",And Milan missing 4 starters in no big deal apparently. Not to mention that they played with a man down for 80 minutes. And even if Milan don’t win anything for the next 100 years Chelsea still won’t be able to catch up.

Not to mention that City are about to surpass all of your achievements and they’ve only been at it for about 10 years lol.,,"Pulisic should never play a minute for this club again

Watching this shit is a chore now.,Playing good doesn’t fkn help when we can’t score,"Obviously a disappointing draw, but have to keep in mind that this is the reason Fulham is in 7th.  They defend incredibly well.  Still a team we should beat though.

We looked better today than we did when we faced them a month ago.  Enzo, BB, Silva, Madueke, and Kepa all played well.

Havertz was up and down.  Made some great runs, but man does he need to learn to finish.

Reece was a step slow, so was Chilly in his 10 minute cameo.... Expected after such a long recovery, but hope to see that improve.

Sterling played well after coming on.  DDF was also good in his sub role.  

Mudryk was not good.  I know there's excitement for him, but if Pulisic had been in and had that game today the game thread would've melted down with hatred.  I know he has more, but we need to find how to bring it out.  Ziyech didn't offer much more before his substitution either.

Mount, Gallagher, and Cucu were really off today.  Those three were the worst three players on the pitch today IMO.

There were some positives, but there was too much sloppiness to make anything of the game.  Hope our new guys start to gel soon because we're gonna need it.",I don't know how much Potter was 'handed' the last window to be fair. I'm sure he had input but from what he's said it basically seems like the background staff did most of the scouting and decision making.,"Ok performance.

But another game under Potter another game we fail to score.","Azpi is deadwood, kills the pace of our attacks. Can't find a decisive pass in time and then kills any disorganization they have","Yeah we are averaging one shot on goal per game, we need to completely rebuild our offense","Potter is going to get the brunt of it for sure (somewhat deservedly, though I don’t personally agree) but to me this remains a personnel issue. This team’s ability to create changes is directly correlated to its wing play. The Cucú/Azpi/Sterling/Pulisic group just doesn’t cut it. None of them can really command a double team of any kind so there is no overlap happening, 1x maybe 2x dangerous crosses all game. Then you get into the center forward position, which is also…meh.

We have so little control over games and this is gonna bite us in the ass if we don’t get a handle on it asap.

1 of them is useful to link up play and put a shot on goal in positions behind the furthest forward attackers. And in general there form has been very poor as of late.

Havertz is better if you want more movement off ball in and around the box as a 2nd striker, and mount is better in a slightly deeper role as more of an attacking mid.

The players lack confidence same as the manager, we can see that when Potter sub in 2 midfielder for Sterling and Felix immediately after we score

Is that a good performance? No not really but a win is a win and hopefully we can start getting a bit of luck in those goals that denied by the post so often this season

Imagine if Felix scored his goals that hit the post we would have a few more points in the league and leading the tie against Dortmund already, sometimes you get unlucky hit the post and went out sometimes it hit the post and went in, hopefully this win can build some confidence for us","To me, it's clear who our best 11 are:

Goalkeeper: Kepa

Centrebacks: W. Fofana, Silva

Fullbacks: James, Chilwell

Midfielders: Enzo, Gallagher, Havertz

Wingers: Ziyech (RW), Sterling (LW)

Striker: D.D. Fofana,","Pain, Chelsea pure blueballin' us.","As I said in MT, I have given up on thinking we will fire Potter, but Potter will not do anything good here, he isn't the guy at all. Nothing good in this team has been added by him yet. Break after Queens death (right at his appointment), Worldcup break and now no games for some time and yet there is not one single thing he has improved in the team.

Fell bad for Ziyech that his move didn't happen, but he should never be starting for us, it's not fully his fault, his one move can give us one or two moments but him having only one foot limit him so much in PL. Constantly has to wait when ball goes to him, so that someone can overlap, till then the opposition regroups. Noni showed what we are missing when he came on. We bought him because our RW was bad, but sat him on the bech, that's on Potter. Had he started the game, we win it.

Cucu is very committed, gives his all in every moment to run even at lost causes, but he is also shit in attack, limits us. So one player from both sides limits our attacking buildup and then Gllagher etc aren't that great from middle, that's why we are so bad in the final third. A team which has ambitions to challenge for every trophy shouldn't have both of them.

Why was Enzo locked at the base, I get we have no holder, but even at the last quater we kept him back. Potter needs to change that. He needs ro be envoled n forward areas a bit more.

For me giving this remaining season to new manager, to start well next season is the right move, but we are going to pretend we can't fire Potter or it means we don't trust the process, when infact process should be entrusted to desrving guy, not just anyone.",Hopefully we have Kova or Zak back. Along with Chilly. And KK turns up.,"This team desperately needs to practice one touch shooting in live situations. Put the ball on net and force the keeper to make a save or parry it back into the box for a rebound. 

Three years running the entire team has taken the identity of RLC and a geriatric version of the Spanish national team, attempting to dribble every ball into the net. Insane possession stats and 2-5 shots on goal per game. Rinse and repeat. Mudryk, Felix, Nkunku, and Noni  are going to open the eyes of this fanbase into how inept our current group truly is.  The future is bright.",If Havertz was a decent player he would've had 3...,I member,"Chelsea are just not a very good team

We played better football under lamps and I'm not even taking the piss,"Obviously the majority of credit for a goal like that has to go to the scorer, but it's simply not possible without the time and space Kai had, and that was in large part due to Pulisic drawing three defenders (including from the space Kai occupied), keeping the ball, and making the pass to Kai's feet. Kai had plenty of time to take a touch and set himself up for the shot because of Pulisic's work. There are a lot worse assists out there than this one.",Decently lol. Something says you love Mount and can't even give Pulisic an actual compliment. This whole post reads like an excuse.,Yeah let's sell Mount. It shows how Tuchel wasn't able to properly utilize many attacking players.,"This was honestly expected. Lads played well but they had a lapse and let it go.

Mendy needs to be better.,"Mendys goals to shots is shocking, bring back petr cech","People will blast me for this, but idc.Issue with mount is he's bulked up and slowed himself down. His biggest strengths were his ability to drop his shoulder and run, make quick movements to have a shot on target and be a difficult target to mark.Now he's slightly bigger, as a result slightly slower on the turn, a bit easier to mark out of plays and his movements on the ball in the box are not as sharp as they were a year ago. Do you rememeber the goals he scored in his first 2-3 games for chelsea under lampard? He physically cannot do that anymore.Now the most he can do is run hard and put pressure on opposition defences, and take the occasional shots from outside the box to score rare wonder goals.   
He needs to change his playstyle if he wants to get back to the same levels statistically as last season, or better."
250,The team is just no fun to watch atm. All this talent and it feels like a chore to get through the 90. The fact that when Chelse ago a goal down it seems impossible to win the game since the goals come from no where. Jorginho looks missed as every game goes on to free and breakdown that midfield. Really is worrying because there's little progression game from game and the team had 7 days to prepare for this.,"Couldn't watch the match but I took a quick look at the Match Thread when it was going on, before the first goal, and the first thing I remember seeing was people slagging off Havertz and Cucurella. Now I get here and turns out they were the best two players lmao.","Lets end on a high.

Potter out.","The really winner in this today is Azpi, no chance he remembers this performance which is as good as you can hope for after watching that absolute shit performance.",Probably the best we’ve played in a long time.

Positive side though, we have pace up front, and Schlotterbeck, Hummels and Sule are all pretty sluggish.

My big concern though is they have 4 skillfull, pacey wingers who are going to go through Cucurella like a hot knife through butter; Brandt & Reyna in particular, and Bynoe-Gittens and Adeyemi to a lesser extent (99% these two won't start ahead of Brandt and Reyna)",Potter should coach our defence to make more progressive passes. Was bored to death watching the back four and Jorginho pass the ball amongst themselves.,"Dunno why we love throwing hate at players as Chelsea fans - yes chalobah wasn’t at his best but he was trying too hard as he hasn’t had game time recently! We are too quick to forget how great the recent history has been, one bad season in the midst of so much winning isn’t a catastrophe","Well, yeah it was the wrong move, but it did reveal the stone-cold truth of the matter: this team sucks. 

At this point, we need a full rebuild, but the worst part is that I have no idea if the coach is any good. If we commit to him and he’s the wrong guy, we could be looking at a prolonged spell in 6-10th place in the table. Or worse.",There's no way this bunch of players can't be playing better than this against this Nottingham side. It's not the players for sure.,"Yeah, perfect way to put it. On to Sunday",,We need to take a second and relax. Arteta and Arsenal have had 3 years to develop the system and the squad. We can’t keep falling into the same BS we always do (Have a bad loss then call for the managers head). We need to be much more patient this time around.

We are **so** easy to beat right now. Scapegoat the players if you want, I'm sure people will, but this is dire and it's not any player (or even a few players) at fault. We need to change things, and I mean that in terms of Tuchel doing something different, not just giving him the sack. That said, if things continue this way, dude is gonna be gone. These results cannot last. This is not the Chelsea standard.",I think my point isn’t being made very clear.Kai deserves all credit for the strike. Pulisic deserves credit for getting him the ball with that much space and time. But I can see an argument either way. What I’m saying is it seemed unnecessary for commentary to act like he doesn’t contribute. I think he’s an excellent player who again today was being played out of position and did well. Commentary just felt unnecessary imo,Everybody was crying over Mount and Kai lmao.,I think he was just gassed and needed a rest,Honestly we actually played good football.

We had most of possession and generally looked more likely to score. 

Chillwell looked great. Broja looked great. Havertz got a goal. Mount had his energy back. 

We conceded so many goals recently. The first thing we needed to do was sure things up at the back. That’s exactly what we did. It’s a great foundation to build off of. And we still have Auba to come in. Kante to come back from injury. Kova to be fully fit. 

Really important win!",,im really struggling to understand how puli is still on the bench with mount in his current form,What a match aside from the refereeing.,"It's so obvious isn't it? It's 2022 and we still have no cover for when Kovacic or Kante are out injured and we expect t some masterclass with an immobile Jorginho in the middle of the park in this high intensity league? It's just utter dumbfuckery to expect us to dominate when this occurs. 

Mendy absolutely deserves to be dropped, he's not improving. Havertz is simply a hot and cold player, and even when he's hot he's not going to produce much in this league. Mount ghosts too often for this reputation he has as some golden boy. He doesn't have to produce GA every game but he was anonymous too often."

What if it was Mendy :(",Kepa.,If you look through my comment history it’s intentional for the grammar police lol,"No, I'm basing it on his previous minutes. And potter has still been keeping him out of the squad because of that injury recently. But, he was on the bench against salzbug and then played only 26 minutes against brighton. So why ramp it up to 90 in a meaningless game is my point.

Of course, it wasn't close to a sure thing he'd get injured, but he just could have easily been subbed for cucu especially when he's sprinting up and down the pitch at such a tough position in terms of the endurance required. Yes I agree there is probably some hindsight involved though.",Tuchel needs to go.

Bench Mendy for Kepa as well.",,Connors carelessness definitely doesn't help his narrative. I hope he comes out stronger because we've all seen him at his best,Anthony Taylor's the story. Job done for him.,"A large part is about the system, but part of this is about getting a set of elite attackers that meet the standard, and it’s not for a lack of trying. No one in our team apart from Sterling is clinical in attack. Every other attacker and midfielder we have literally can’t score or assist consistently. We need to get to a quality where Mount or Havertz can’t get into the team as they’re meeting the standard, and they’re clearly not.

Havertz as false 9 and Mount as some kind of inside forward needs to stop. We’ve gotten away with this for too long, every opposition team knows the general approach on how to somewhat counter our back 3.

We also need to stop playing the front three in such a non-structured way. There’s no bloody consistency."

None are PL proven, none are experienced winners and in most cases aren't a big improvement on what we have. This maybe a contentious opinion here as we seem to have a fetish and propensity for hating our own players for some reason. They have massive potential yes, and I am very excited for the future, but it was always a big, big doubt they were going to come and immediately improve on what we have, as seen here today. The best move of the match from us was worked between Mount, Ziyech and Havertz when he hit the woodwork.

It's hard to hear but we really need to think about writing this season off in competitive terms, at least in the league. Give everyone, new signings and familiar faces the rest of the season to find their rhythm and playstyle together. The reality is with the age profile of the squad they're not going to be playing to their maximum potential for 2-3 years anyway.","There is absolutely no pattern.. It is quite evident from the fact that the players are having to look up to make passes.. It is always good to look and pass, but if some set patterns are developed, then it becomes easier getting out of tough situations, without wasting time looking and analysing.. I remember during Tuchel's times, the defence had this triangle passing with the midfielder to bring the ball out of the fullback area and up the pitch (Particularly remember how Azpi used to get free, just pass to jorginho without thinking much, purely on instincts).. Today, I felt Cucurella was struggling to break from his press, as seen when he lost the ball before their goal.. He should not be thinking in such high pressure situation, but should instinctively pass to a position where he knows a Chelsea player would be, but that requires training pattern play..","He wasn’t appalling today but I honestly hope we get rid of Ziyech after this season.

If I had one thing to say to Chelsea fans about Potter it would be to have patience, he took 1 season before we started consistently playing well and 1 more after that to start seeing results.

I know Tuchel has always been more pragmatic than otherwise however we were also playing fluid, beautiful football under him with rotations, interplay, link up, etc.

I feel at some point soon after the crucial injuries last season and results dropped, he just went way too overboard on the pragmatic side and significantly reduced on attacking dynamism /fluidity for more rigidity and solidity resulting in a very static way of playing.

Unfortunately, he just wasn't able to bring the players back out of it due to everything going on at the club (Sanctions + Lukaku + heartbreaking champions league exit + 2 final defeats + him having to do 2 jobs to help Boehly + divorce + entire back line leaving + new players needing time to gel).

You can say Potter should stay calm, but on the flip side, losing your shit and copping a fine works too; how many times did Mourinho, or Conte, or Sir Alex do this and surprise surprise, next few weeks they get some VERY soft calls/pens go their way? He might be ""emotionally stable"", but he doesn't have any tactical knowledge what so ever. And not to mention, players looking over at a manager going ape shit at the fourth official can go both ways; it can do nothing/make it worse, or it can inspire them.

There is no project, Potter doesn't know what he's doing, there's immense talent at the club and he has no idea how to use any of it. The only reason we were in that game is West Ham presented us with the perfect set of circumstances, they made a terrible tactical decision and paid for it early on. As soon as they stopped playing such a high line, we looked ok at best. And despite west ham handing us that first half on a silver platter, we still couldn't go in infront.

I think if he played from the start we would win 3-0. His penetration combined with Broja would rake us goals today. 

Kai literally contributes nothing, he can’t keep the ball, he can’t finish, he can’t create a chance, he can’t get into a chance. He deserves to be benched and Pulisic diserves to start at least 5 games in a row. 

Also Broja needs to play more, he shows flashes of briliance every time he gets the opportunity.","He lost 2 rats in pulisic and ziyech because they wanted to play more eventhough performing awfully. And this game showed their level once gain.

Chukwu in particular should not have come on at all.

Clearly we are as shit going forward under Potter",It's a point where I'm surprised if we even score  1 goal in a match.,Yeah. My same thoughts exactly but Gallagher was quite good probably best player with Havertz. People are so hateful. How can people be so blind? Havertz has a huge ceiling. Those one touches to get the balls in control was so damn good. He needs to stay. He is our most talented player imo along with Reece.,Broja looks so good when he comes on,if puli started over havertz this game could've gone so much better,"Same feeling, at its worst under Tuchel we weren't this bad","They don’t look unbeatable though.

Newcastle held them to a 3-3 draw. Liverpool beat them. Villa drew with them.",There is no plan out there. The players are playing for themselves and not as a team with no leadership to pull them together. Sadly watching Tuchel on the bench tonight it looked like he has begun the end of his time here and is losing the players belief in him and his tactics.,He’s going to make such a great coach one day.,"Terrible? Palace is quite good at keeping their shape and forcing perfection and then they can counter although not that effectively this year. City is the only team that has unwrapped them.

Still something needs to change. So awful to watch. Didn't deserve the win at all.,,"I don’t understand the hate against Havertz. He is still young and learning how to play with his back to goal. He has never been a prolific scorer but somehow the fans expect that from him. Now that Werner is gone, Havertz gets all the hate but Mount was really bad as well. Havertz always gives his all and does the dirty work that he’s asked to do. Somehow this was enough for people to not give up on Werner yet Havertz gets the hate. I think it’s his price tag which worries me bc Fofana will have the same pressure. I can’t wait until we get a mobile 6 and sticker and we have Havertz drop back further so we can utilize his skill set better.",The standard of refereeing in England is absolutely shocking,Lampard <- Sarri <- Conte. They’ve all coached btw. So the problem may actually be CHO himself.

![gif](giphy|cPffUXtDIulH3LRmgV|downsized)",Another shit performance dispite win. Get Potter out,"  

Immensely tricky one to pen this, undoubtably result wasn’t good enough…

Buuut…to play devil’s advocate in a sea of anger: Potter got the starting line up completely wrong IMO, even tho this game kinda should’ve been a gimme, I think he felt it was in the bag, when in reality we need a win from anywhere to get the ball rolling, and instead it’s more depression. As much as I like Mount, he needs a good month on the sidelines, he is ridiculously out of sorts. The first half was genuinely atrocious and I actually nodded off just before the JWP goal.

That being said, I think all the subs were spot on, Raz and Wes were superb when they came on, Raz especially gave us a lot more threat upfront, and on the balance of the 2 halves, we should’ve won. Mount was still poor, and I think Kai could’ve come on earlier, but there’s no point dwelling now on that. Obviously the end of the 2nd half was marred by the Azpi incident, and that will be what’s on a lot of peoples minds.

I do still support Potter, but this was a game that made me worry about the process, tho imo the changes relaxed me a little bit as he reacted well to the game. I know people get pissed off because he doesn’t scream and shout, but he obviously does care. Seems people in the match threads are more anti-Potter or anti-Mount rather than supporting the club…the amount of people I saw being thankful that we didn’t score at times because they want Potter out was embarrassing.

Reality is, he’s not going anywhere this season, so either buy into the process, or shut up with the toxicity. It’s not helping anyone; abusing players and Potter isn’t helpful, and while they don’t read reddit (probably), the toxicity does undoubtably spread through other social media, and we have to remember that they are all human, and it must suck rn that nothing is going their way and shit outta luck, and people abusing them online just piles it on.","I need someone explaining my why Havertz and ziyech want replaced , even cheek tho he played well second half. We have so many players on the bench.

It means swollen I think, people use it sometimes to talk about erections haha. Watching us the past few months has definitely not made me turgid 🤣",you have players seeing out their contracts that just do not have the motivation any more. A guy like cesar is a great example. Absolute servant for the club. Very consistently above average but not outstanding. Won the trophy with the big ears. Has won every trophy there is to win. Wanted to leave for a new challenge but was convinced to stay. Now we have the club captain who isn't all that motivated. Isn't protecting the young players through his performance and is MILES behind the first choice player. We should have been brave enough to say thank you for everything you've done and send him off in the way he deserved.,Really hate that you miserable cunts shitting on the team right now will still get to experience the joy when we start winning again (eventually),Really well said. I thought the level from the players and the coaching staff showed that we aren't going to fade into the dark. We will be back stronger next season I am sure of it. Thought Ziyech had a top game as well with heart for someone who is close to an exit it was admirable to see that.,,"As always, lots of positive chances but we can’t finish in the final third. Add that to your typical Chelsea giveaway goal and there you have it boys. The worst part is that Arsenal didn’t even play that well to be fair. Had basically no shots on target to start off and we didn’t take advantage of any of the chances we got. Havertz has a few good looks and messed them all up. Again subbing on changes too late from Potter. Overall mediocre performances. Don’t think we’ll be qualifying in the CL with top four anyway. Maybe some CL magic and we win it all again?

Sorry but Lukaku was right.,"Yep, I immediately thought of Kane when I saw this. Wish it was at least a yellow.",I thought there was some positives in attack today. You could see some more directness and some more chances. Mount had a few bad misses with the header standing out as well as Sterling hitting the post and making a few poor decisions. It's going to take time but there is stuff to take and build upon from this game AND 3 points.,Very realistic outcome for Spurs post UCL game.,This organization is a complete joke right now.,"Agreed, especially since Potter has a track record of favoring ball-playing goalkeepers.","Ah bad take from me there tbf, it’s hard to judge him playing in a team that’s a man down for 70 mins. 

Reece James definitely has something to say about being the best right back though",,"Say what you want about how shit the players were, but almost the entire squad looks frustrated or uninspired. Tuchel may have been a great manager in cup games, but it looks like he's starting to lose the locker room.","I think its time for Kepa to start. Mendy has been forming below par and after this game, its clear we need to change the GK position. The first goal by West Ham should've done better.

It’s not all the same. Chilwell offers a much more rapid counter than shaw does. His crosses are superior too. Shaw has a better finish though and he is stronger. If Southgate actually used an attacking wingback system Chilwell will be better suited. But Southgate usually plays too defensively. So the wingbacks are effectively just extra defenders. Which suits Shaw better.,"All these clowns calling for Tuchel's head will be calling for the next manager's head as soon he loses a few games. When will Chelsea fans learn that chopping and changing managers is not the way to build for the long term? Our league performance since 2017 says it all. Tuchel is dealing with the same issues that every manager in the past 5-6 years has dealt with. Underperforming players and toxic bench players who think player power is the way to go. If Boehly continues the Abramovich way of giving them that power and sacking managers to protect them, he's making a mistake.

If we keep making steps up like this I'm more than happy to give Potter next season and see what he can do.

Outside of that I’d say you’re spot on,This team ain’t it,But then how do you explain Aston Villa and Palace? Even our first half against Wolves and AC Milan wasn’t impressive nor convincing.,"That's partially of his making though. When the ball gets to him the attack either ends or he scores, he doesn't seem to be able to pass the ball or even look up to see if a pass is on. Hopefully he's able to learn that with time, but as has been said before, there has never been so much hype over a striker who scored 6 goals in his debut season",Chilwell and Mr Blobby were injured.

Not Milan.

Had opportunity to go. Glad I didn't now.,"Mendy bailed out, Kepa really deserves a chance because Mendy is a complete liability.

Chilwell has been missed, he just makes runs that Cucurella doesn’t.

Nice for Havertz to finally get a goal but it really shows it doesn’t matter who we play up front, we can’t get the ball into them. Just passing around the back and every ball forward from Ruben was so painfully slow.",,"Might be a hot take, but conor isnt that much to blame as people are making it out to be. Cant really blame gallagher fully for the second goal. He was left stranded in a bad position alone, while 9 of our players go into the box. Just why?

Have we learnt nothing from past season? United goal from our corner when jorgi was left alone? Or against wolves in 20-21? Only difference is, jorgi let the play happen and we conceded, while conor took one for the team.

The first card was silly but the second, he couldnt have done much better. Fucking hell we always get spanked on counters from our own corners.",FUCK ANTHONY TAYLOR,👏 Great points about injuries to Kante and Kovacic. A Leeds player jogged past Jorginho 2 yards away and then it takes Gallagher out of position to cover for him

VAR was on our side ! Am I still dreaming",Well there you have it. An extremely tight 1-0 win with a corner goal against 17th in the Premier League. If that hasn't shown you that Potter can win it all idk what will,We have too many shit players. Mr. Hedge Funds spends loads but it’s a waste when there’s no time for a manager to even build a proper squad.,Someone's put some voodoo on this Chelsea team and Todd Boehly needs to sacrifice some goat rather than buying everything he sees.,Fuck we should have just unregistered Pulisic and kept Auba in just incase. Havertz can’t capitalise the chances.,"That's exactly what it is .him deflecting criticisms as ""Chelsea fans are entitled to their opinions"" without addressing how garbage we are.","Pretty solid performance from the guys overall. Defense was on point, Jorgi was controlling the midfield, the attack seemed decent, thanks to Ziyech, Kai & Mudryk",Damn bruh,That's 100% on the manager,Nothing has changed infact we've somehow gotten worse,Well said.,,Couldn’t watch the game… how bad was it?,"I fell asleep, the result didn’t matter to me because we were playing shit. Unable to bypass the Newcastle press and not even doing anything of significance in our own press. Missed entire second half and woke up to the 1-0 FT score. As if it wasn’t expected, honestly speaking it’s over. It’s hard to even fathom over a year ago we were UEFA champions. Now… what are we, mid table. I’ll support Chelsea even if we become a Sunday league squad but it’s hard to be excited for anything we do.","We don’t even have 3 center backs right now nor do we have 2 wingbacks, it makes absolutely no sense to play that formation.","It's pathetic that we have dropped four points to teams around us in the table, in United and spurs.

Its head to head,You Pulisic haters are embarrassing.,Tbf he scored a banger against us so that was even more bittersweet imo. It just felt plain weird to not celebrate a Lampard goal.,"We lose that game were it not for a defensive mistake from Salzburg. 



No one will acknowledge it because it was ""exciting"" but the tactics today were dogshit. We were wide open defensively for the whole game and the only thing that stopped us conceding more was Thiago Silva being incredible and a couple good Kepa sweeper moments. The one time Thiago Silva's contribution to a defensive move was equivalent to one player, instead of that of two or three, we conceded. 



I'm not ready to go into Sarri V2 era where people pretend dogshit performances like that were good just because they were ""exciting"". Winning football matches is about balance, the balance was about as off as it possibly could have been today.","Facts, I think we have one of the most competitive 1,2 spot in the league.",[removed],,"Fade the flairs. No but actually, we switched off after the goal on both sides of the ball and there's very little risk taken in terms of pass or runs once we went down a goal. Need creativity desperately. Pain.",I don’t know how we’ve spent 300m and not addressed our forward problem. Auba ain’t it. Hope I’m wrong. Fofana was solid. Not sold on Koulibaly hope he can adapt to the physicality. Rubes decision making is poor; this gets particularly highlighted with his back to goal.,,"How did Havertz stay on the pitch the full match? He did duck all. Quack, quack! Looked average until he was gassed at 65 minutes. He did keep trying though. Take him off at the end instead of Cucu, let him run the point. Better yet, take Havertz off instead of Sterling for Pulisic. 

Trev was good, not great. Sterling, RLC, RJ, Cucu, were great. Oh, Thiago Silva was monstro!! 

Mount was invisible again. Mendy was iffy. Jorginho was average to okay. Gallagher was... Schoolboy-insanely undisciplined. 

Down to 10 at 28', Azpi on at half for Mount, and then no more substitutions until the 75'. WTF??","Absolutely pathetic refreeing from Anthony Taylor and VAR. Two goals conceded because of VAR and Anthony Taylor lear match fixing.

Honestly ridiculous and disgusting. Is there some sort of [change.org](https://change.org) or other petition that I can sign to contribute towards revoking Anthony Taylor's refereeing license? Please let me know.","And that right there, is the issue, and it seems most of the ""fans"" in this thread can't seem to put their head around it. 

That mistake happened at the 33rd minute in a 90 minute football match. The team gave up for 60+ mins when it's easily possible to snatch some result back. That - is the biggest issue this squad has had under Tuchel. We keep clean sheets yes, but in games where we concede and the opponent looks slightly threatening, we leak 3-4 goals. It's a pattern. And it falls on Tuchel and his lack of man management. Discipline and patterns can be coached, he doesn't seem to be doing it. Red Flag."

Do you really think potter is suddenly going to be playing world class football next season?,I didnt watch this match and of course we get the job done.

Honestly offered nothing in that second half against a Luke warm city. Kepa and cucurella resuming their obligatory fatal error per game. As soon as that goal went in we accepted the loss. Absolute dog shit mentality. Unfair of potter to bring on all the youth at once. Hope it doesn’t damage their confidence. Zakaria being class the whole game was one of our positives.,,"We got rid of a football manager for good vibes check, feels about right",Appreciate this take.

Lineup was all kinds of fucked,New manager bounce is over!,"Mount and Puli has always (for last few years) been our best attack.

Nah, that is not an excuse to not play him there. We have a best RWB in the world, who is extremely influential when he plays there. Playing him out of position is sabotaging the team. The difference between Reece and other CB options is much smaller than between Reece and other RWBs. Playing Trevoh, Azpi, Ampadu RCB is better. Playing Cucurella LCB, KK RCB and Chilwell/Alonso is better. Playing Emerson LCB is better.

Reece should be only used in two roles. As RB/RWB or on bench, resting. This is not negotiable, and if Tuchel insists to play him there, he simply needs to go. I am willing to give him so much patience in everything else, but this is the thing that absolutely cannot stand."

Played so much better than the first 45. Good subs from Potter after getting the starting lineup wrong. It can’t be easy to choose the 11 because we’ve got so many young players who are talented yet inconsistent and rough around the edges.


But on the evidence of the second 45 (and the game midweek plus first 45 Vs W.Ham), there is a lot to be hopeful about - so much potential; phases of good play that we need to maintain for 90 mins and once we do, the ball will have to cross the line.


Since this new team (new players plus those back from long term injury) we’ve looked very promising. We can’t expect perfection though - you hear from Reece himself and other players that anyone who’s played the game and knows football, understand that it’s going to take time.

We have a whole new team and young inexperienced players who are super talented but inconsistent, plus still settling in the country, acclimatising to the culture, maybe don’t speak the language and still to find and settle in a new home. 


There are a lot of positives since this group have come together. It’s not perfect nor consistent. we’ve also been hugely unlucky with the ball not going into the net.

Madueke and Mudryk have shown flashes but most of the time look out of their depth. Mount is not currently an option. Still don’t have a traditional striker.

The fans and the players need to relax. Players trying to dribble through four guys in the box. Fans acting as if Potter is the worst manager in the history of the PL. Top 4 is gone. This team isn’t winning the CL. Potter isn’t going anywhere. This isn’t the Bundesliga. It’s not realistic to expect to be at the top forever.

The sad part is that when we needed a goal we still have 7 players behind the ball. 
People may slander sterling but I think he was the only one who was offering a service he was always available. 


And Borja needs a loan.

It’s so obvious how few people have ever played football past the age of 15 on here and truly don’t understand what it’s like to be a player or manager. 

Tuchel came in and said “my fucking way or you won’t play”. With a smaller squad coming in after Lampard’s mentality, that’s easy. After a while, players saw that that didn’t matter. He played who and how he wanted whether is was good for the players or not. And (every?) attacker openly talked about how shit that is for them. We never scored many goals under tuchel consistently. 

New mindset with potter again, but so many players and not a single one of them going out and taking a starting spot. That’s because of youth and unfamiliarity. Enzo showed up, balls on the table and said this is my fucking spot. Badi is just a casual, smooth, boss of a defender and he knows it and shows it. Name one other player who’s done that? Not sterling, auba looks miserable, hakim can’t wait to leave, puli never healthy, mase and felix are constantly pointing fingers but at least Felix’s movement gets him in spaces for opportunities, mase has started running into people. 

A young player needs to see an opportunity and take advantage. With older guys around them being toxic and not showing them how to take advantage of opportunities, the guys need a reset. Some time away and then come in with a clear message and clear voice. That’ll come this summer when we get players out who don’t want to be here. 

Until then, I love potter mixing it up and allowing for different players to have a shot to see if they go take it. Chuck didn’t, Connor showed a lot, zakaria is always in for a midfield tussle, Kai plays as much as he does because if he can find some form, he’ll be worth more to sell in July. Chalobah has a role, but this game was huge to get a result and see what a few of those guys are made of in crunch time",When are questions gonna be ask about Potter he’s clearly not the right fit,Cucurella does not cut it.  He’s dreadful,Ugh!!!,maybe 1 game?,Our best game yet in recent weeks but the usual story of wasting opportunities just had to be there.,"We need to bring in RB cover so we can bench Azpi, we need a midfielder so we can afford to bench Mount who has been horrendous for 2+ months and we need an out and out striker so we don’t have to play Havertz as a striker (which he is not one)",I don’t blame potter I blame putin and the fucking owners for sacking the entire staff. Unacceptable especially after all the fluff pieces about how they wanted to build around tuchel and marina,Utter dross,"He just chases everything like a dog, but like a dog, cannot complete simple 5 yard passes.

Arsenal were able to cut through this team with no issues. 

We have all seen big losses in modern history(Man City. Bournemouth etc.) but this team looks so weak mentally and physically we shouldn't need to rely on Kova to come on to make things look lively.

Graham Potter is a potentially great manager but as it stands he has no past to back him up for these situations to calm or inspire the fans.

I think this will be the year we miss out on top 4 as our luck has run out.

As always though KTBFFH",He’s just so limited in what he can do. I love it when he connects with other players who can make the pass but I’m tired of having our “best” central midfielder being a poor creative passer.

I’m only optimistic because hopefully we are finally getting a team and structure in place to build a proper functioning team.,"All other things aside: it's good to see that Potter is able to make a key substitution first-half when he sees a player struggling. As much as I loved Tommy T, his subs came only at the 60' mark like clockwork no matter what happened in the game unless there was an injury, seeing a 36' tactical sub that changed the game was refreshing, to say the least.","It was his position, he looked like he didn’t learn how to play the RWB role.

That second goal from Sterling is a play we NEED to focus on creating more, it's proof of how lethal Sterling's traits can be if we focus on getting him at the post

Cucurella, after a terrible first half, fucking balled out in the second. His passing is elite.

James and RLC were lethal on that right side, RLC in particular should've walked away on the scoresheet today. I think it's about time he goes back into the midfield, and James can honestly write down his own check.

Thiago Silva, no words. He's fucking 38 playing like prime JT, absolutely enamored with him at the moment.

Definitely some negatives that need to be addressed (Havertz was better today but overall could be better, Mount was anonymous in the first half, and Gallagher...it'll get better), but take the positives of today and we'll be so much better going forward.

Yep, also doesn't just have to be 1v1 with the keeper, if you are still in the center circle and there is a defender and keeper between you and the goal, if the last man defender brings you down then its a red.

Enough is enough.",21 shots man.. Seeing people calling us unlucky but at what point does it go beyond that? So frustrating - week after week.,Nearly fell asleep through that,Lewis Hall already took his spot?  Why did we go back to Cucurella again?,I truly believe we are the worst counterattacking team in the league it's absolutely baffling how so many decisions are constantly wrong,"why can't you sack him? why are you willing to throw away years and millions behind a guy that has never won anything and has made no impact in 20 games?

what is it that convinces you he deserves time?","To be honest I’m all for the process but once he hit like 15th it reaches a point where I don’t care whether we’re in a rebuild there’s a certain level that we can’t drop past and I don’t care how many injuries there are this squad is not fifteenth place quality. I’m not asking for winning every game but show some progress and constant improvement if we can’t do that sack him. I don’t think we need to wait three years before these players can string some passes together in the box. It would be completely foolish in my opinion to wait three years or some crap for a rebuild. 

If we lose the next 2-5 matches I’ve gotta be honest he’s gotta go no matter how much o want to rebuild none of that matters if we’re fifteenth we are two good to be there and I refuse to believe that we have to go that low in a rebuild l. Heck in hindsight I don’t even think potter was good enough but there weren’t many options aside from pochetinno. If he was sacked now I’d consider enrique but he’s more of a big name and I don’t know if he’s actually a good manager or just has Messi Neymar and suarez. 

I completely support the owenership but Todd would be a fool to keep Potter in if we lose the next 2-5 matches. I refuse to believe that in order to rebuild we must lose every match.","Azpi is a club legend but giving him that £180k a week deal was stupidity. And the less we talk about the Koulibaly and Auba signings, the better",He needs proper skills first,,Potter is not that guy.,"I don’t think we were getting top 4 under Tuchel either, but yeah","What a shit take. Loses 1 game in 10 - pretty much all coming in the space of a month - while dealing with multiple injuries to starting team members and he calls us not good.

Fuck me. Bandwagoner much?","Not a great game, so cant really complain about a draw","He’s never going to be a penalty box player now, simply hasn’t developed that part of his game since youth football. However he definitely still has his usage as a jack of all trades in the middle third.","Just to humour you, let's say everyone's fit, could we have fielded the likes of Haaland and de Bruyne? 

Not even close, with these current teams if this had been serious we would have been trashed 5-1.",,"I have been a Tommy Tactics supporter, defender, apologist, whatever you want to call me up until today. I can’t say I’m as upset with him as some fans, but I have questions after that performance. I want TT to be the manager, I want him to be the one behind the wheel and calling the shots. I think he can be that guy. But this performance was woeful by our club. No excuses for anyone. Tuchel needs to make them run home or something. Get angry, show some passion for this team because there was 0 in tonight’s game. Embarrassed right now. Wake up Chelsea.","I’m not saying he had a bad game at all! I thought a couple of the saves were right at him but a couple were also pretty decent. I was probably being a party pooper even bothering to push back on it, I just didn’t think he was particularly good or bad. Just a decent, solid performance. But I might also be comparing to his recent excellent performances and a really good game from Kohn at the other end","I guess you did not watch the game. Literally one of the goals came from an over the top ball to Silva.

There were a lot of balls played like that. More than usual. So yes they are slowly changing the way we played.",Looked fresh as fuck with that haircut,"Ok, Cucurella defends better, but why the fuck you don't start Chilwell?

I think the new manager will start Cucurella, but he's not better than Chilwell and it will cost us because Chilwell offers a lot more in attacking",Oh no! How dare we want to become like one of the most dominant and successful teams in English football history!’,Neither did I. And we're all celebrating. You're still mad that you got called out. Now go sit down.,,It's going to get worse before it gets better.  I don't know why,Cheating feels so good ahhhhh,,"the best knowledge from today is that despite gallagher's sabotage, we looked REALLY GOOD in a 4-4-2 in the first half. Please stick with it.",I really don’t understand how the hair pull wasn’t a foul. That boggles my mind. What if he pulled him down by his shoulders?? What if one of our players had pulled down Kane by his hair in the box would that not be a penalty.,"Which is weird because mount was much more involved last week after we adjusted and dropped him back in. Don’t know why he was so absent today, it’s like he was playing out on the wing."
290,"Sack this utter clown now. This can’t continue. How many shambolic performances in a row do we need to watch before he goes? Another 20? No. We have no play style whatsoever. Chilwell is only player I’m not disgusted with today, at least he put himself about and looked as if he gave a toss. I’ll personally pay for Luis enriques plane ticket to London. We honestly look like a side that’s two divisions below spurs. Put an end to it NOW.",THE SILKY GERMAN IS JUST WHAT WE NEED,"WE SCORED FINALLY AND GOT THE 3 POINTS I'M


😃😃😃😃😃",Imagine entrusting and investing 100s of millions of dollars on a manager like Potter. We deserve this for sacking tuchel,"Quite frustrating that the one decent chance they get is on a counter and they score, fair play, game is the game. But can’t be too mad at how we played, clearly the better team in terms of possession, chances created, except from that counter we was very solid, it’s just the same story we’ve had the past 5 years, no decent striker to put away the chances and this won’t be solved till the summer so untill then it’s going to be a frustrating watch at times, but overall, we played very well tonight and if we had a competent striker we probably come away from this 3-0",Well at least we are no longer 10th and three clean sheets in a row is a good thing right? 🤷🏼‍♂️,Which is 100% better.,"Chuku shit the bed but MM looks talented and he’s coming off a big break, defense was solid with Felix coming back our attack is gonna move a lot better",Even if we finish below 10th?,"The question shouldn't be ""Why shouldn't Potter go?"" The question is ""What can realistically be done differently?"" Like I'm genuinely asking, who would you even bring in at this point? They'll have the exact same issues as Potter. No preseason, no time to identify players, and over half the squad is out injured. 

Chelsea have been unequivocally terrible under Potter, full stop. But what the fuck could anyone do with Chelsea's current situation? What is the point of hiring Potter, or any manager for that matter, if you're solely judging them by how their performing with a completely broken squad with a bunch of mismatched, mediocre pieces, consistent rampant injuries that make it impossible to play a consistent lineup, or even train with a consistent set of players, and no preseason? 

Frankly I don't care whether they sack Potter or not, he's done nothing to convince me that he's ever going to be Chelsea quality. But failing this hard isn't exactly a huge indictment of his ability either. It would take nothing short of a miracle to make this dogshit group of available players be anything resembling competitive. Firing Potter doesn't fix the fact that a 33 year old, barely able to run Azpilicueta is Chelsea's only available right back. It doesn't fix the fact that Chelsea's only available left backs are a headless chicken and a literal child whose not even a left back to begin with. It doesn't change the fact that the only recognized strikers in the squad are a 33 year old, long past it Aubameyang and a random 20 year old from Norway. 

What does changing the manager actually fix? Chelsea had one of the best managers in the world at the beginning of the season and they looked just as miserably flaccid.","I’ve been very pro Potter this whole time. But this 2nd half really showed me he doesn’t have what it takes. You can tell NF was coming at us, everyone and their mother could see there’s a goal coming and he could not do anything tactically to change the team. Really disappointing.","He's Proper Chels, He's also proper shite.

No club will ever challenge for 4th with Gallagher in the team, I love his passion and it's great seeing academy lads play but the lad doesn't have the technical quality for were we need to be.",,How tf did cucu get 6.9 rating lol,"Hey, it's me, a chelsea fan! I'm getting joy from my favorite* team losing because I had a strange attachment to the last coach. I'm also blind to any problems we had in the last calendar year under that coach.",KK and Fofana injuries have been unlucky. They will contribute majorly once fully fit.,"I don't care if the draw was deserved or not, I still feel pain thinking about the way we conceded.",He's never good as RWB but what other options do we have in that system? Azpi can't do it all the time,Ortega played the shit out of that game. If that was simply a case of puli not being able to shoot then cfc doesn’t have a single player that appeared in the upper third today that can shoot. Because I’m pretty sure Ortega denied every Chelsea player who stepped on that field that isn’t a back. Puli had some abysmal moments with through balls and decision making in the upper third but I think Ortega deserves a bit more credit for the Chelsea headaches todays.,,Do we start placing bets on who will be our new manager? Or we wait till Fulham does the same to us?,physicality is just something they specifically look for as a recruiting philosophy through the whole RB system,"It was an excellent finish. I personally don’t think it was “outrageous”, it was a very good striker’s goal, something we haven’t seen since we last had a very good striker, which has been an absolute age","He played every single match nonstop for what, 7 years?",Fans freaking boo’d at the Bridge. What a joke.,I'll allow it!,Yeah celebrating by calling out old comments and being the very thing you accuse others of yourselves. Criticism can be valid at the time and teams can improve since said criticism,,Chelsea got absolutely bullied in that game.,Missed the game. How did Broja play?,,Ohhhhhh Thiago Silva... Ohhhhhh Thiago Silva,Haha fuck yous you cunts! The only thing more obnoxious than your fucking dweeby coach is your racist as fuck fan base! Hahaha!,"Because he's a worse pivot than RLC or Conor, he's a strong attacker but he's not been good when deployed deeper at all."
291,"I don't remember Chelsea playing so bad for such an extended period, like even 15-16 we scored some goals at least. Sack Potter, it's idiotic to even think he can turn this around. Players are wasted and muted under him. We are a relegation side right now for fucks sake.",Dirty diving cunt,"If the Leeds keeper scored I would have jumped out of my car on the freeway. 

That would have been an insult.",#PotterOut,I'm really frustrated.,This team plays like it was put together in a month and it was 😂😂😂,Yeah but watch these clowns abuse the shit outta him and scapegoat a our manager,"Mudryk is going to win the 2024 Balon D’or, heard it here first",And we sign players for him and then say oh he looked bad then why did we do it? when he is fired and we have wasted millions building his team. Sure man. If we have sense we fire him now.,Honestly I wanna give him a year he inherited a fucking mess. Give him a summer transfer window and see what he can do at the end of 2023. Remember when the board offloaded like 10 deadweight players when they took over? Hopefully we can do that again. This season is a write off already might as well let him finish it out,Can't even say let's hope 2023 is better for us..,"He’s also not very good

Can’t point out a single thing he actually did right when he came on.",,"Xg chelsea 0.38 arsenal 2.38
Unbelieveble.",At this point I dont think the investors know shit about football in the first place to get it.,"We spend it poorly though. Lukaku, Werner, Sterling, Pulisic, Ziyech, Cuccarella were all bad buys. We’ve needed better midfield options for 2 years. We need at least two top CBs, ours are all too old or just not good enough. At least with Roman we were quick to change course at any cost. New owners just throw good money into the trash.",I was at the bridge last night watching it. Great game and an amazing atmosphere,Watching our attacking passing form is like watching old people fuck.,He's been in the job 8 weeks.,,"Disgusting performance all around, there is no life in this team. And tuchel needs to step up soon or he should be gone",And never try to sub off the keeper.,Good strikers can bring goals out of nowhere. Auba got way too much disrespect when we brought him in.,This is immense. Feel like we never rotated enough with TT. So people stayed out of form longer.,Silva mistake gave them a goal let's be honest. We played very well.,"Funny that, and it's all the London teams. Guess we're just too 'posh' to cheer.",Then accept the criticism and go sit down.,,100 comments in 2 minutes 🤣,Haappy to see r/soccer seething once more. Fuck em all,,Is it safe to unclench?,Atm it's our fault as well. Liverpool got the FA to stop Atkinson refereeing their games. We should have done that ages ago,"Kante does not create that much more when he's in the side, and at this point is just not a good passer. Post CL win he fell off a lot and was a part of some our worst losses last season including awful performances against Madrid and Brentfod."

Results will come - encouraging performance,"I think we played decent. Plucky. I liked it. Enzo playing as a six was great, although I'd like him aside more defensive player. And I'd like someone more creative than mount in the 10 role. Other than that though, we had good chances. And I loved our physicality and pace w the new players especially up front. Think we're onto something here!",man we can have Mbappe Messi and prime Buffon in goal and with a manager like this we'll play at 60% of our capabilities,Mudryk looking like he’ll bring two things we’ve been missing this season: pace and directness. Looks a very good player,"Good points.     
Potter may work out, it's too early to tell either way. I don't get the sense that he's lost the dressingroom yet, which is important. 
     
Team does lack swagger right now, they need a victory against a quality side to start building some confidence.",I'm sure changing the manager again will surely get the results we are looking for.,Team sucks,carney and zakaria have to play more they were outstanding today,,"We're a bit shit at the moment, aren't we? That being said, that world cup has fucked everyone's schedule. What a crazy month....","This is the squad Tuchel left us. 

Don’t act like the problems weren’t evident before he left. 

That Champions League came with a price.","I am consistently surprised at how slow he seems. I think he will get better in his overall play with us, but the pace aspect is worrying. If you're short, and you have no pace that is a problem in this league.",Two shit teams tbh. Such a lack of quality and abundance of mistakes,Problem is we don't really have a good back 4 with fofana out. Thiago silva will have a lot more problems in a back 4 aswell as whoever is playing RB,His anticipation was so good,,I wish tuchel got to build at Chelsea. But sadly this is going to eventually lead to his sacking. In a sport as emotional as football you need your players to trust and believe in you 100%. You can’t force these men to play well for you if they don’t believe in your project. Two of the players featured here today tried to leave the club a few weeks ago and were sort of forced to stay. This kind of stuff is expected with a guy like tuchel. I would like to see the players group chat. Seems like PSG all over again for TT,"Fucking yes. Chalobah just needs to iron out those occasional mistakes and he's gonna be great. 

He even has a knack for goals too.",Wasn't  outrageous but a proper  clean strike not seen at chelsea for a while  now,"Mate genuinely, if you're this negative about a 3-0 win and think that was 'shit' and the goals were 'messy' (?), I'd just stop watching football altogether. Clearly you're not going to enjoy it, so just give it up.

Or you just want to moan at anything, which is pathetic. Either or.",SHIT PLAYERS,"City, Liverpool and United are shocking as well.

I really never thought we'd be counting the exact opposite kind of streak with this team, lmao. God, so fucking pathetic.",Emre Can't,Yay we won,"I’m always players out first because they had many chances. That includes Mount, RLC, Havertz. They have been stale and have been performing poor for over a year.

I have defended Potter for a while, but today just zapped it out of me. I’m players out first but I can no longer defend Potter. Absolute disgrace.","We played well but had 0 luck. I wouldn't be mad if we sold Ziyech, RLC, and Havertz this summer",😅😅😅😅😅😅😅,"Why do we need an LB when we have hall and maatsen? 
Also a cb when we have colwill?","So the positive overall is that we put in a shift. Something that was massively lacking in our terrible run, the players definitely put the effort in here.

But despite the effort, the quality just isn't there (fortunately Liverpool had the same problem). We got into so many good positions, but dithered on the ball, made one too many touches, or stubled into a group of 3 players. Absolutely nobody showed instinct in the final third except Murdryk.

On the latter, I was really impressed by his dribbling in tight spaces, I thought he might struggle due to lack of fitness but he looked really threatening. I think when Felix returns, and also Sterling - despite all the negativity, he's used to playing fluid football and gets lost at times when he has to hold up the ball - we'll be in much better shape.","Truly level headed comment, many guys in the thread should learn from you","I'm not judging a manager until the ""core"" of the team is gone, at this point. They've shown too often that they aren't at the right level, they don't have the mentality, or their legs are just gone.

Azpi can't keep up anymore, kai is constantly invisible, Ziyech and pulisic are inconsistent and injured, jorginho is a farce, kova, as much as I like him doesn't offer enough, koulibaly is an embarrassment about half the time, auba is past it, even mount has been invisible.

I don't believe there's a manager on earth who could get this group playing effectively and consistently.",please start chalobah this game koulibaly was playing against us,Zakaria looked great. So impressed by him.,,I’m tired of playing a wingback-based system with no wingbacks.,You can go and support a different team.,"I said at the time paying a world record fee for a player who is nowhere near world class was terrible business

Of course this subreddit told me we need depth and it’s an area we needed to strengthen. Why we didn’t go for a cheaper depth option is beyond me","Agreed, tie was all I really expected after the first 30 min, it was very much back and forth with good quality. That we went up on a pen speaks to how well MUFC have been defending lately.",To be fair without Fofana and Silva we don’t have a great back 4 either lol,"That's just not true. They had 4 youth players, their backup keeper, a couple starters and a few bench players. We had 6 starters, 1 youth player and 4 bench players...",,"Arteta lost like 19/20 games at one point.

Optimistic for the return fixture.","Gallagher was really poor today; no urgency when on the ball, terrible set pieces, gave away multiple fouls. Sure, he offers a lot of energy, but that's not enough at this level.",He’d have been sent home today under Roman,Like I said the other day 4 at the back was needed and man did it make a difference. Players looked far more confident on the defensive and the foundation play on the offensive was solid. Thiago making all the players around him look like Gold as always.,Best comment here.,"That’s a good point. For me I think we need to strengthen a few key areas in January and give Potter until the end of the season to see progress.

If we are still showing relegation form by the end of the season then I reckon you have to cut your losses and get rid of him.

The loss maybe yea but not those humiliating performances,"You may as well turn it off as soon as we concede, can't remember the last time we came back into a game from a losing position, it's a sure thing once we concede and its just depressing to sit in half-hope for so long only to always be let down",In fairness to him Potter insists on playing him in a position he clearly can’t play,That's true but the 3 points were this close 🤏🏻 That's why it feels like... you know...,Send this as a email to Chelsea FC.

Conceding too many goals on defense isn’t the problem, we are tied with Arsenal and City for second fewest goals conceded. Creating the chances aren’t the problem, we’ve all seen our matches, and have seen the xG. 

Is it finishing drills in training? If you were Potter, what tactics do you come up with to actually put the ball into the net? I’m genuinely baffled at how little we score, and it’s much harder to accept when our defense and chance creation isn’t even poor."," 

Bro, did Dortmund goalkeeper some kind of hybrid monster?",Thought we actually played a little better then we had been. Still work to do but looks like we are going in the right direction.,Potter wouldn’t be here under Abramovich to begin with,We need fucking Kovacic,I will write this down... for the history. Not that it matters.,"I agree completely. My brain is telling me chelsea should try to break the cycle of players giving up playing for a manager, back Potter and judge him in a year's time.

My eyes are telling me he doesn't know how to organise a defence, a midfield or an attack. There's no squad harmony, no enthusiasm, no fight.

He also seems to have lost the fans too, who are also going after the new ownership as well. That will raise the pressure on him considerably. 

This is by far the worst I've ever seen Chelsea play in 30 or so years. It might be the worst I've seen any team play frankly.","Not sure what it is but it feels like there’s a mental block with this team. Forest pressed us hard in the second half and we couldn’t match their intensity. Our biggest problem this season is not being able to match opponents with an aggressive press. Some of the issue is personnel, a strong midfield is important here but more than that it seems psychological. We just never look like we can move beyond third gear.",Release for Zakaria is less than 30m. About 27m if I remember correctly. Definitely think it should be activated if he continues like this,,0.26 xG for match and 0.08 in the second half.

People complaining like we bossed the game. The result is on par with the expectation. 

I feel like we coulda nicked it if we had a Werner to sub on instead of broja. Not cuz he’s better but just the pace at the dying breaths could have helped.",RLC needs confidence not aggressiveness. It’s like he doesn’t want to mess up and that slows him down.,Its a lack of quality rather than lack of motivation,,"Appreciate tuchel’s work winning the CL, but with the squad he has, if the best he can come up with is passing it backwards and horizontal for 90 minutes he’s gotta go.

This is probably an unpopular opinion, but the absence of Tuchel would also probably welcome the return of Lukaku — snake is a snake, but if he can come back and score goals I’m sure all would be forgotten.

We need a shift away from this 5ATB system, it’s not helping us defensively as we still leak goals, and our offense is shit. City and pool don’t need it to dominate possession, so why do we

Edit: oh and bin ziyech, Jorginho, and pulisic.

Nothing he can do when sterling is so far up the pitch that he is basically 1 vs 2 constantly,"Looking at how we performed today, draw is fair and square result.","1 - havertz just looks so languid sometimes, like he could produce wonders but he needs that extra second and metre that top class opponents won't give you

2 - I can't believe RLC today is the same man who owned Tottenham earlier this season. In the first half of that game especially, he looked unstoppable. Today he was quite literally a pedestrian. I don't get it.

3 - I felt broja could need people like hazard and fabregas, people who would constantly look for him and play him in first time. Not rlc, jorginho, havertz, mount, kova, cucurella etc. Who were content to play it around and wait for an opening that never came instead of trying to beat their man and thread the ball through.

You seem like an absolute ray of sunshine. You must the the one everyone waits for when they show up to a party.

We are looking for more fluid than at any point in the last year. Attackers are not completely there but are showing signs of getting better and fringe players scored which can only help confidence. Our squad depth is very deep. Kepa has been playing well. Koulibably is also starting to really adapt. Conor is beginning to play well.

Looking forward to continuing improvement under Potter.

I just hope we stop playing AMF like Mount and Havertz in the wings

We were looking like City at times playing keep away with our possession when linking with pace from inside to outside and flank to flank even when down a man.

It's always side to side, pass to left, pass to right...

Not even once we tried to pass through the middle.

And why the distance between the midfield and the forward was so big?

No player (mid/fw) tried to become the bridge between the midfield and the forward.

Everyone in midfield who went forward were all in line with the forward. 

I simply do not understand why we are so stubborn to only attack from the wings.

I don't know whether that's TT's instructions or the players are just clueless on their own position because it looks so dumb.

Well if the players and the coach continue to be stubborn with this stupid and very predictable attack pattern then I think I'll just stop watching Chelsea. It's super boring. I really wonder how come the team thinks that their opponent won't be able to predict/prepare well against such pattern if even I, as a spectator with zero football skill/tactical knowledge, know which way they will pass all the time.

If they continue to play like this, basically we only rely on set pieces (we suck at taking them), penalties or individual spectacular moment/skill to score.

And we just hope that the opponent does not get pass us with their creativity or determination, get lucky ball or lucky strike or set pieces (we suck at defending them).

I think for me it's better to just stop watching for now because I watch games to have fun, get entertainment, feel happiness.

Now I'm only left with frustration, feel super bored, annoyed and discouraged every time I watch the games.

Wishing you guys all the best for the season. If they are persistent to do the same thing all the time, then I really hope we can grind the good result in every match. If nothing changes soon then I'm afraid TT will get the sack. I'm not TT out or in. I just want the team to play proper and fun football.

Azpi also shocking for their goal.",He presses so much he should be counted twice,,,Cool,"I noticed Mendy is scared of contact. I'm not sure but ever since his injury last year, his confidence has not been the same since.

Any other team of our size looks at that as a massive risk and makes changes to the squad so they aren’t in an injury chokehold. Just look at the consistency of City/L’pool midfields.

We know Kovacic and Kante are only fit for 75% of our matches each; we’ve known that for _years_ at this point.

Both Kovacic and Kante will be out simultaneously multiple times this season. If Jorginho and Gallagher are the solution every time this happens then we may as well mark the season as a failure already."

It's no surprise we've looked like garbage every time Tuchel had played Mount or Gallagher in these positions. The only players that should be getting picked there are Kante, Kovacic, Jorginho and in pinch RLC. 

Jorginho played 7 minutes on the weekend why couldn't he start today?","We need a healthy Reece James and to go away from the back 3 for a period unless we actually need it tactically, we don’t have a rb tho with rj injured azpi can’t play there at this point (even tho he closed it out there)",He is confident with the ball at his feet but I feel his positioning sense seems bad sometimes.

A lapse on a set piece and keeper errors cost almost 2 goals, but as far as open play goes we looked solid, they had very few chances and no great chances.

I'm one of RLC's biggest fan, yet unless you play him at the top of the midfield 3 (aka where mount played), he should not be part of the midfield except for emergencies.

Wait so you mean Tuchel gets a pass because players like James, Kante, etc got injured. Wouldn’t that mean that Potter also gets a pass because those same players (and more) are out? Nooo because that wouldn’t fit your agenda!

Literally everyone has said this since the Brighton loss. And this comment says “get to the level to which Tuchel brought us in 6 months” What level?

People who are constantly banging on with some crazy agenda in the thread of every post on this subreddit is one thing, but being upset and slagging people off in a post match thread is pretty normal, and IMO fine. It doesn’t mean these people don’t support the club.

Like I said, he wasn't the main issue today (literally my first sentence, so not sure why people failed to understand that?) and other attackers were pretty dreadful as well. Both Mount and Ziyech were dreadful.

We just look dreadful. Yet this is basically the same team that won the Champions league 15 months ago. I don't understand what has happened",,Raheem really stepped up in the 2nd half but he was honestly awful in the first half.

We played much better today but its still not good enough. A striker is needed. Havertz up top just isn't effective enough we arent clinical.

I can see flashes of something, so hope Potter can turn it around.","Imagine giving Lance Stroll a Red Bull and expecting him to win the championship 

That’s what we have done with Graham Potter, 600m to have Southgate as manager",There's no gameplan whatsoever. We are just relying on individual brilliance. See how Sean Dyche made his impression in first match itself,"I actually don't care, we should try our best to keep Silva. He reads the game so we'll, imagine how good an option it would be to bring him off the bench to hold out a game if he is too play less next year.","Our process before Boehly was ""sack the manager and buy new players"" and hope the new guy could do better.

Before you go off about winning trophies, we had to take a great deal of debt to keep up.  Not to mention, it helped create a toxic sub-culture knowing that Roman will likely sack the manager before selling any of the players.

It's obvious what the goal is with Potter's appointment is.

We are trying to mimic what Man City is doing with Pep.  Have a long term manager to implement his vision and build our program on it.  Pep's vision goes all the way down to the youth level which is why the kids you see play don't look at all out of place.

Add the sheer amount of games to the mix and it’s a tough old time for this group and manager. I’m confident we’ll do some business in Jan and really look to build for next season.

What a turn around by the club and so so unlucky not to put more than 1 past them. The goal conceded was lucky for them as well, I think Enzo should’ve fouled him earlier but I mean that’s a situation where you need someone to make a great play and the attacker did.

I saw a lot of bright spots today, particularly in the second half. That they started 11 shots to our 5 going into the half and we took 15 shots to their 3 in that second half. Dominated the second half and just unlucky.

Back line looked solid. I think we had opportunities to get all 3 points. We were timid in front of goal when there were times to go for it. I don’t know why Mount didn’t shoot it standing in the box dead in front of goal, Ziyech had a great drive deep into the box before blasting it over, and Chuk took an extra touch. Mudryk was legit. In the end, most of our concerns were proven right - where are goals going to come from? I still don’t know. We have lots of creators but not any finishers.",What is the process though,Right now it feels like the floor is limitless and we’re in a hardcore free fall.,"We’re just so confusing a club top to bottom. Sign a ton of busts, play Azpi “in position” despite his legs visibly falling off after 55 minutes instead of Chalobah or anyone who can at least run, but then we play Havertz at “out of position” at striker week in week out when all his success comes as a second striker/10 who can drift. We regress manager to manager with a few good runs in form under each and we just seem so allergic to a full rebuild that the only consistency we have is coughing up points and looking utterly complacent doing so.","Not the reason the best team scored ONE goal, yet is somehow the scapegoat for the game and season.

Those players have been shit and we shouldn’t be afraid to just sell them off and continue to see how terrible they are.

Those sorts of biases are best teased out and addressed with metrics and analytics. It’s so easy for us to just see what we want to see otherwise (you can still do this with data, mind you, but it’s harder).",,,"We are a mess right now. Today was the first time we played with four at the back in a very long time, but we were very off. One thing I noticed is that our players get tossed around like toddlers and it's not just today's match, it happens often. We lack physicality and cohesion I think. Also as much as I love TT, he has a big role in the image we have shown in the last matches.",Was Cucu playing in the midfield?,,Yo do you mind altering your birth certificate every week so it always falls on a match day?,Tuchel spitting nothing but facts,![gif](giphy|BBkKEBJkmFbTG)
319,I wonder how Roman feels watching this?,could have easily got a hat trick if he got lucky,average at best,"I don’t post much here, but as others have said…

Our new players have gotten worse little by little each game under Potter.

I find it hard to believe we would spend so much money on these new signings who are actually pretty good at what they do and then they just become a shell of themselves once here.

Maybe I’m wrong:

![gif](giphy|EZYQjm1uPrXGg|downsized)",Finally a better 2nd half performance. On another day Felix takes his chances and we win comfortably.,It’s evident there’s zero chemistry there. Not surprising considering a lot of the players are only here a month max. Looked really disjointed offensively,He wasn’t fit to start,Decent performance with a weakenex squad but we need to do better. This was always going to be a tough one despite form - liverpool still have a decent record at anfield this season and of course we are chelsea. Really annoyed because we missed that clinical touch and just werent sharp - they were there for the taking,"No no no... Don't bad mouth Potter here, we are looking good for the future in the championship","Lampard had a much better squad, don't be so ridiculous.","This must be some residual from chopping and changing players and coaches and messages so often, but it’s really frustrating how we go from a top team to just falling off a cliff. 

I thought Tuchel was staying around and we could keep one solid message, but somehow Putin randomly started a war sent us spiraling again. We have plenty of talent on the pitch and yet results are constantly dire.

It’s hard to see Potter’s vision yet, so idk what to do. I worry that the worst parts of Roman’s era will continue into Boehly’s era as well. The highs are great, but the lows feel really fucking low",Hard agree. Give the academy boys some time! Atleast they give a shit!,,"Transition year. Auba up front, no creativity at all in the team, subs who don’t want to be in the team, and a new manager to deal with all of that.

Just need to be patient and back the team. See where Arsenal are now. City, Liverpool from when they were crap to now. Painful to watch for now but as long as we’re not trigger happy, will get better.","Sterling is also on similar wages. Its blatantly obvious that these Americans have no experience administrating a football club before, and we are probably going to be struggling for a while.",Well in general he is not Chelsea quality. He is dreadful going forward too.,"Would’ve been 3-1 without him, and they only got the 1 by a . . . by inches.",They were pretty tired in the last 10. All our possession back and out the other side definitely contributed,"Grealish, Mahrez, Rodri, and Diaz would absolutely be in our best 11. Hell they'd be some of our best players.",,"Tuchel Out

Nothing else to say",,I don't think there's anyway you can say they weren't absolutely tradeful and offered next to nothing,"Notice that I did not mention the name of the player and the name of the manager. I could be talking about anyone. Different people can substitute the name of a player and the name of a manager here as they please.

I could easily say who's talking about Tuchel and Mount.","I must admit, while I can see why pulisic and ziech felt misused under Tuchel, and why they now suffer from lack of form and confidence, they both frustrate me. When they come on, they both seem to play for themselves. And be poor at it.","Yeah that’s as good an explanation as I’ve seen. And it dovetails nicely with my pet theory that younger coaches (mostly in the NFL) anonymously browse Reddit game and post-game threads to get perspective. Yeah, there’s a lot of drivel to sift through, but there are insightful comments to be found. 

If I were a coach, I would 100% do it. I’d take all the help I could get.",,,"There are a few ways to look at this - reactionary is hard to avoid - can we keep playing like this… but it’s early in the season… many questions not many answers currently. Can’t see Tuchel getting sacked anyway not for a while yet. 

Atrocious start to the season.",The FA asking “Are we even now?”,,Happy fucking birthday boy ! Get innnn.,[deleted],Chelsea Football Club.

""Trust the process"" all the way into relegation and championship",Devil must be at work. Only Jesus…,"Trying to stay positive so I’ll say the new signings looked good, especially Enzo. Even Fofana impressed. Mudryk I have no idea what happened. 

I can’t help myself from adding just how bad Havertz is and has been his entire time here. There’s no reason I can see to not start Fofana over him next game. I’m sure we’ll still get Havertz, Mount, Gallagher but I’m so sick of it. How these are professional football players is beyond me",I was genuinely curious if all of these excuses disappeared. Thought they did. I was wrong. We still have these.,"MM looked amazing every time he touched the ball. He always knows where the next pass is. Ziyech looks renewed(trying to get his stock up). Jorg was good in our mid and our defense looked solid - Badiashile looks like a great buy. Mount, Hall(still developing) and Kai were poor. Really think Fofana needs a start. Aubu and Kai need some rest.",Why did I have to read this god forsaken comment right as I took my first bite of food?,Lampard had a better team vs woprse opposition.,"Average team with average performances, nothing new, nothing disruptive... So, average position in the league",Why does it justify Enzo price? We were actually pretty solid in midfield.,,"I've never seen an impactless player such as rlc, watches the game pas by him every fucking time.",I mean Zakaria did play against city midweek,"Yup squads been overrated for awhile, we somehow end up winning a trophy every season and getting top 4 by the skin of our teeth and it ends up masking all the issues within the squad and there are a lot. 

Hopefully this is a wake up call",But he is shit,"I was astonished when they left Havertz on, he was our weakest link today by a huge margin, and we opted to take out the guy who looked like he wanted to do something (Broja) instead.",Quality in one department. Finishing. But we created a lot of clear cut chances today which we usually can’t say.,,"Tuchel is a great coach and there's very little doubt in my mind that we cannot improve on him, but there's even less doubt that Roman would sack him after that, they look utterly lost, full of quality but unable to show it. One mistake cost us again, frustration on the pitch between key players, substitutes like Ziyech and Pulisic just embarrassingly bad, something needs to change big time.",,He was bad today. Hopefully looks better against Milan,So no shithousery?,"Lots of positives but the attacking depth sucks badly. Ziyech and puli are both not good enough at this level, give some young attackers a chance instead of these poor players","No bench player will always be consistent, you need game time to remain in match fitness and form. They get stop start game time. What they should be is good players that you trust having as backups. RLC is that and more.",,,"So what exactly went wrong today? Players started brightly and then died around 25 minutes in. That points to two things:

1. We cope very badly with going behind. All our attacking play and creativity goes to zero as we turtle up, praying not to concede another (spoiler: we do anyway)

2. The players we have are unfit, tired, demotivated. This is also true: we have players playing out of position, game after game, in a very gruelling league. While fresh young options are limited to substitute minutes. Game management from Tuchel was non existent",Chilly my man delivering always! I would like to see Kai as CAM. Cant wait to see Auba to start at ST,,Happy birthday! 🎉,One thing I am sure this match will do is it will fire up Tuchel and the players.,We are getting better every day
321,This is all Pulisic’s fault.,"He was lucky that this penalty was repeated, otherwise Good performance",Goal of the year already!,Who is going to be the new manager?,i think i need anulo mufa in our version,"Mixed emotions, some good debuts and performances but still lacking the ability to score. 
Positives - Enzo on debut, after being in the country 2 days and not training, incredible. Some of those progressive balls were what we have been missing for a while. Badiashile and Silva absolute rocks again. Reece, Sterling and Chilly back - not huge impacts but good to see them out there. 
DDF nice work to get around that keeper and defender and should've scored, but positive from him. 
Madueke was sublime and looked a real threat 
Negatives - Mudryk was invisible, however will say never got put into good areas by his team mates. Havertz and Mount lacking the final touches again. 
And we still just can't score, 2 goals in the last 6 is grim. A lot of work to do there!","are you seriously defending potter with the players we fielded? we have a120Mil player in our midfield and Ruben is okay, we also had one of mudrik/reece james dropping in to help out the midfield",We should easily be getting 3 points in our delayed home game against them if the majority of the squad is back.,Jesus Christ,"united finished 7th that year and got 64 points, the lowest they were all season was 12th and that was only after the 6th game. never lost 3 games in a row either.

they were never this bad",Presuming it’s been mentioned already but bar that final pass that was a woeful cameo from Gallagher,I think Havertz needs to be rested against City on Sunday. Typical if he gets injured too.,,"Would love to know how many passes went backwards vs forward today. Tiago long balls aside. This was worse than Sari Ball. Our midfield is a joke and may as well not be there as it’s just a huge gap between the defence and attack. They don’t break forward to attack, they don’t link play and they don’t defend other than standing off the man try to look like you are doing something and relying on Tiago to bail them out. Not that any of those attackers can do anything either with their poor decision making but a lot of that comes from only 3 people breaking against an entire organised team which means we stand no chance.","Sticks with Auba, Sterling and Havertz gets flamed, tries something new gets flamed.

I really don't blame the front 3 today, they were so isolated by the defence and midfield not being able progress the ball. Looked much better after 65 minutes but should have made some tactical changes earlier.",He lost his first match today as chelsea manager,"I really scrolled through the game post to search for Kepa comments and found none. He did, and done, a great job in the past games. No fault to him for this game, one extra inch would have saved this game.","Exactly this. Rotation is for cup games and maybe CL but you can't rotate this much when we are playing fucking Premier League. Teams like Brentford should be 3 points easily but playing with a ""b"" squad doesn't make it easy. Such arrogance from Potter.",I mean we're absolutely saturated with American media and they say it all the time in shows and movies etc. Guy is just being pedantic.,,"I'm not totally sure, but I think this will be a fun, not over the top, post match thread.",,"It's okay to be critical when they have bad matches. Our midfield is definitely our weakness at the moment, sadly after this trio were so good a couple year ago.",Thanks.,"I was firmly Tuchel In. Still am somewhat aggrieved by the way things have gone down. But the match was all right. Thought we played well, looked positive and there were some interesting movements from the players from an attacking perspective. We still suck in the final third and our defence still has the tendency to go AWOL. Cucurella rushed in rashly, Silva mistimed his tackle, Azpi wasn't fast enough and our midfield was nowhere to be seen so they scored. If there's anything I've truly grown tired of, it's the tame shots we concede. I don't know if a great goalkeeper saves that or not, but IDK, not convinced by either Kepa or Mendy.

There are positives. I was really happy to see the send-off for Tuchel at minute 21. I think with that, I put this disgruntlement at one of the more emotional managerial breakups behind me. The other positive is that Potter has 17 days to get his football ideas across to the players. Hopefully, this time, it doesn't stop working, eh Jorgi? Onwards and upwards. 

P.S: I don't really want to be in the Europa League. So lads, if you're gonna fuck it up, please fuck it up comprehensively and finish fourth so we can focus on League + FA Cup.","Only three things in life are certain:

Sterling cameo was goood, Chilly is back and did ok. James is back.

Offensively we can score goals as proven, i dont care if Reece will be our top scorer if he scores 15 goals, yes Kai is playing poorly but Broja hasn't been fit and ready yet, maybe he will get his start vs West Ham now and Sterling can play off him in a 3-4-3!!!!!!!!!!

Some of these players are here for the long run and I wonder how well they could develop mentally if for once we didn't replace our manager in a struggle. To be truly challenged not to perform at the highest level but to actually bring themselves up. Sick of this year and a half cycle constantly. Managers need experience to develop too, and for all the issues we've had we still controlled a Conte Spurs side that went and spent for him like we wouldn't.

And for spending and all the talk of it, we've had the most dogshit record breaking window I think is possible. Like £115m replacing players who the old regime couldn't be arsed to offer deals to, £12m to replace a £100m flop, £40m or whatever to get sterling in for Werner and an obscene panic but of Cucurella over fears that Chilwells gonna get another massive injury.

Nothing fucking revisionist about that.",,"We had the money to bid 90m for Leao and 50m for Lavia and Alvarez, but we decided 33yr old washed Auba and Sterling that kills 20 chances for 1 good act, are enough for attack.

No creative midfielder bought, but somehow we will go for Alvarez in Jan again. SMS was right there the whole window.

We were in desperate need of a flaired dribbler who can cary the ball and a creative passer. But got none. But yeah we did buy Cucurella for 63m and trusted Azpi to cover the extra CB position.

So much bad squad planning this window, so much. Ronaldo scores one chance of those Auba wasted, at least 1. But I guess he couldn't have pressed like Auba lol.

Why wait till next window in Jan even, if we had money buy some players now, if we miss CL, you think these players are coming? No lol. We aren't Barca. But people will claim what a window. We could have spent 200m without any owner, we had stopped taking much money from Roman recently. The amount we spent wasn't unusual, we spent 210m a season before, any owners that don't take money from us spends at least that in his first window. But I don't blame the owners, Tuchel had a mare here deciding the targets.

Sterling, Auba aren't the guys to break a parked bus, but we didn't even try for the likes of SMS. But we go in for Neymar, Leao and Gvardiol at the last days. When none of the team was selling them at the time. Litreally next day Gvardiol extended, he was in discussion the whole time, but sure let's pretend we bid for him. Milan weren't selling Leao for 90m, but we tried that the last day lol. People can't see how BS these are.

But we thought keeping Pulisic who wants out and Ziyech who spams one thin only and has no right foit is gonna be great, well have fun now.",,"But he was pretty bad today tbh. Midfield as a whole looked slow and clumsy, possibly due to both not being fully fit I’d assume",tuchel loved CG....,"I’ll start this off I guess 

POTTER OUT",He had a lot to make up for to be fair.,,,"This was embarrassing. Top 4 looks hard if we keep giving such shit performances. Broja needs to start, man's got that striker Instinct which clearly Havertz doesn't have. Cucu needs to calm down a bit, man's aggressive and not in a good way.","Chillwell and VAR saved us today. I will take this undeserved 3 points. But, we are still all over the place after playing 6 games. The moment I saw the line-up I knew we would struggle. Tuchel is still playing players in wrong positions. We only played well against Spurs and struggling Leicester City. We are struggling almost everywhere on the pitch. What are we actually good at? Poor tactics, shambolic defending, aimlessly passing, rubbish attacking. This is depressing to watch. Tuchel needs to wake up.",,Me too,"I think it's clear where our next transfer targets should be.

I never expected to see a Gallagher - Loftus-Cheek pivot this early into the season, and especially not in a fixture against Spurs. That isn't acceptable, and with Kante and Kovacic injured, we can't expect to overload Jorginho with minutes as the more experienced option in that position (whether you rate him or not, that is a different argument). We desperately need a holding midfielder to at least support Gallagher/RLC in that pivot for now and give us an option of playing a back four at times this season or in the long-term. I do want Rice here, and I know there is zero possibility of that happening this summer, but I'll take a cheap alternative if we can be smart and avoid buying a deadwood player. The player would still get minutes next season, assuming Jorginho (and maybe Kante) leave. Would be nice to have two DMs (Rice and another) as options, instead of just one holding midfielder that we've had for the past five years. I wanted to see Ampadu given a chance in this position as a stop-gap, maybe even Gilmour (I'm a huge fan) though he doesn't have the defensive ability yet he is positionally aware and disciplined and that is important here.

The other position is a striker. I don't think we're a team that generates many chances, but the first half today provided us with a lot of joy on that right flank but we never had a striker in the right position to receive the ball. We can also talk about *that* missed Havertz chance which is inexcusable. I don't like this Raheem as the central player experiment, let him play off the left or right please, even if he isn't going to be the best presser or workhorse like Mount and Havertz are.

The next position is a right-sided CB, and one that can play in a four. I like Fofana, although was disappointed with him against Arsenal. He is extremely expensive, I wonder if it's worth focusing on the two positions above for now and exploring the CB market in between now and January/end of the season. I do think we need an upgrade on Azpi and Chalobah though, depends where your priorities lie. Reece shouldn't be harnessed to RCB shifts all the time, but it is a good option.

Right wingback is another area, though RLC has honestly impressed me a lot. I know we're being linked with Gordon who will play a dual role here, I prefer not to speak on that.",https://youtu.be/pACI9rHmmyI

Kepa at times looked a bit frightened, it is not shocking tho as he conceded a banger from Salah before.  
Silva-Badiashile looks very nice, Silva brings a lot to the squad as always, Badiashile proved me wrong so far.  
Cucu was impressive even after a that injuring charge/tackle (and as always not even a foul call, refs unanimously hate this guy for some reason)  
Chalobah was a bit nervous/lacked composure and could've a bit contributed to attack, at least take some pressure off of Ziyech.  
Jorgi was to be fair im unsure what to say; at times looked like wasn't helping us build but at times really put down the pressures and attacks, solid job tho.  
Gallagher is a la cobham %100, played his heart only lacked decisioning in final third.  
Hall is as i've mentioned in match thread smart and quick thinking but lacking spatial awareness and the technique to execute plays, yet pretty levelheaded for his age (better than bajcetic for me)  
Ziyech was impressive in many cases, really has that technical brilliance and can fool everyone on using right foot to cut in.  
Mount was meh,disastrous i wouldn't want to say that but lacked everything.  
Havertz was good today, Liverpool playing a high line let his inner Müllerish space finding express.  
Mudryk is so fucking precious so far especially considering that debuting in Anfield.  
Chukwuemeka is for me at the moment ahead of Mount in progressive playing.  
Azpi showed his defensive capabilites and personally had an honourable performance at least in dying minutes for his 500th match.

Sterling is not a wingback, stop playing him as one.

Thiago Silva and Azpilicueta are sadly finished, and it hurts to watch them drop that much in quality.

Cucurella is the most useless signing we have made in years, we didn't even need Cucurella and signing him has made us so much worse in defence. Why did we even sign him again ? What was the purpose exactly. It felt like a impulse buy at the time and it still very much does. The money could have been better spent in getting a striker we desperately need ?

Aubameyang might actually be the worst striker to ever play for us, he offers absolutely nothing at all. He just walks around and cashes in.

2. Sterling missing two easy chances.

We’re in a total rebuild, but we’re gonna have spend super clever or big. I think both is needed in this team if we’re to challenge anytime soon.

Good on Newcastle.,"I’m so tired of people complaining about RLC. He’s a squad/rotational player. Everybody can see that.  He can play a few different positions, but we know he doesn’t excel at any of them. But he’s versatile and can play decently in those positions if we need him. 

Well guess what?  We need him now. We have 3 fit midfield players (not counting Zakaria because he can’t get a chance). Kovacic is recovering from an injury and still dealing with it. Jorgino has been playing almost every match. Yes, Jorgino and Kova are our best midfield combo at the moment.  But we’re playing matches every 3 days and they can’t play every match or they’ll be constantly injured, making our problems worse. We have no other midfielders to play there.

Right now our build up dies because when thr ball reachds cucu/Dave, they mostly take the safe option by passing backwards because they are relatively uncomfortable with the ball.

Also, Chilwell and James bother dare to venture higher up the pitch, while cucu/Dave tend to stay at around 2/3 line.

There's also kante who is massive in progressing the ball from midfield. Having him vs gallagher is just a stark difference.

It's also worth noting that he's willing to sign short contracts that don't pay much and prove himself and isn't one of those players that wants a long, high paying contract just because he's old.

There was a few sequences and plays where mount made the wrong decision. It is now becoming a reoccurring theme every time he plays. 

First few moments of the game on the counter where he could’ve played Mudryk through and abuse his pace, he delayed the pass by taking 2 extra touches and it gave Tete enough time to cut off the angle. 

Second sequence was towards the end of the half on a counter attack where he instead of driving forward, he cut in and tried to switch the play while off balance and it got intercepted by Robinson. 

There are other sequences where I thought, what is he thinking? Did Mudryk pick up an injury or did potter think he was that poor he needed to get subbed. I would’ve took in Fofana and dropped Kai to #10.

Tuchel specifically said in his interview that it ""wasn't"" a mentality issue. Idk if I can post links to YT in this thread but look up the post-match interview from hayters TV channel, there is a dedicated timestamp for just that question and response from tuchel.  
It's clear to all of us that it's mentality related, but tuchel thinks otherwise, and therein lies the problem. He doesn't seem to be capable of sussing out the core problem and then fixing it. Attack wise we've gone severely downhill compared to lampard's first season, and I have no clue how that's even possible with a supposedly better coach (which he is, but seriously, wtf is going on).  The CL winning squad has regressed so badly.  Players like Reece, Mount, Silva, etc stand out as the only good players in this squad, the rest are not up to par to challenge the likes of City for the league, far from it."

Maybe Potter is out of his depth and maybe he isn’t good enough but Tuchel couldn’t get a tune out of these players this season either.

Madueke couldn't complete a pass in the second half, and we also don't know what Mudryk's fitness is like - presumably not great since he didn't play for months, had a recent illness, and has yet to complete 90 minutes for us. 


In a perfect world you'd have Sterling come on but he's injured. Even Pulisic - but he's injured. So right now it's Ziyech. 


Loftus-Cheek again - Zakaria, Kante, Kovacic all injured. Loftus-Cheek is the only one that realistically can pair with Enzo right now, Gallagher and Mount don't have the defensive discipline. 


Cucurella - again, Chilwell has been injured a long time so fairly Potter is bringing him in gradually to avoid reinjury. Chilwell will obviously take over starting when ready. 


The one you didn't mention is Havertz for Fofana which is the one change I really would have liked to see. 


Most of what you're complaining about can be put down to fitness and injury which isn't really on Potter.","This team lacks a natural goal scorer, you need one to win games in leagues.. last season the fan based was hyped up on havertz cos he ran around and looked active but man had 14 big chances missed.. next evolution in attack is to get a striker and have felix, madueke and mudryk create chances..",“THEY RUINED MY LIFE” - n0t_malstroem,They actually thought it was a negative to play youth defenders against City which is all you need to know of the quality of their commentary,This team hasn’t been the same going forward since Hazard left for Madrid.

We aimlessly put crosses into the box against these low blocks,Boehly has a massive hard on for Brighton so this is a conspiry theory I can get behind.,,"Another game where in the final third we create nothing and show no threat. IN the first half we at least showed some signs but nothing too convincing. It is a real issue that we don't seem to mix up.

The back 4 works better for us given the injuries within the squad (this game today was probably Cucurella's best in a Chelsea shirt) We do seem a bit more solid, yes it takes away from our WB attacking options but with our best WB's out this makes us more convincing. I do think defensively we were fine today, besides the woeful corner we conceded from. But being able to stop a good attacking team in form from creating many chances we can take that away as a positive.

The attacking side is a different story however Raheem, Kai and Auba just didn't show anything today. Arsenal this season are very well organised at the back and show it week in week out but the creativity we showed was non existent. I do believe Potter needs to shake up the front line going forward, we see potential and more threat when the likes of Pulisic or Borja come off the bench. So I think we need to work on a mix that does the job.

This mid week game coming is a good chance to test out different line up top or even mix the formation to see if we can create something new. I don't expect us to win (probably the majority opinion as well) so this will be a good chance to try.

It absolutely had to effect the players,,,And to Think i have been Down voted like shit for my arguments that Joao Felix is levels above Mount and Havertz 😂😂,Honestly I never understood how Cucu was starting over Chilly considering his performances pre injury last season.

They went after the senior players as they damn well should have.,"I’m really struggling with the tactics of this team or should I say lack there of.  I miss parking the bus at this point because at least then we had dangerous play off the counter.  What exactly is Potter doing? 

We rarely generate any over loads where we have a player up and can push the ball up the field through passing through.  The defense almost never gives the holding mids a pass into space where they can turn and push forward.  Heck Zakaria was so out of position half the time Thiago was screaming at him to come to.  So we just get stuck passing in the back where Koulibaly looks like he’s about to crumble at any moment.  

Our lack of ability to cut through the other team sees us only have the back in the final third when the opposition is comfortably sitting back.   

I don’t even have words for our forwards because we are like 2-3 levels below being in a position to even be able to criticize the part of the game where we are so absent.",I thought Kai was not good at all but the other 3 were on point today,,"We are morphing into United by the passing day.

I don’t have anything against him, I’m just very sick of people acting like everything would be fine if we kept Tuchel. We were very, very bad for 8 months, the league had figured out how to play against us and he made zero adjustments.

Edit: and just to add to that, I loved Tuchel for everything he gave to the club. Not just the CL, but how he guided the club through the precarious times. But a change was necessary. Yes the squad is the main issue, but we needed a project manager, not a win now manager. If we want to get back to competing for titles, we need to have a complete and total rebuild, I.e. Arsenal. That’s simply what is necessary. And Potter , who has controlled multi year projects for multiple clubs, is a better fit for that than Tuchel",,"If tuchel’s system dictates we play slow, possession-based, no final ball & the players don’t rate the system, what’s keeping the team from going out and just playing their own game for the 1st 45min?  The worst he could do for the insubordination is at 1/2, make his 5 subs.  If we went out against his wishes and played a high pressing, 1st touch passing, aggressive, positive style, all he can do is helplessly watch from the sideline.  If we started scoring for fun, wouldn’t it just make sense for him to submit and abandon his boring-ass tactics???",,"To be fair, his yellow card resulted from the dude literally holding Mount’s Jersey for 20 yards and then somehow that being on Mount.","

You're spot on and and it's absolutely bizarre that there are still people in the fanbase in denial about this.",,"Surely we are due to adjust the midfield personnel. RLC has no incisive passing at PL level, isn’t quick enough on the press and is reactive.

Season after season. For years now under different managers we're incapable of fighting back from conceding a goal much less a deficit. Sure, it's happened a handful of times but it's shocking the amount of times we just look incapable of scoring after we concede. If we were 2 or more goals up we just better hold on. If we were 1 goal up then the best we can hope for is a draw. If they scored first then you might as well just change the channel and watch something else because we're not coming back. Spurs have a reputation for being bottlers but today's match aside they seem to consistently come back from behind this season. Us on the other hand, and like I said this has been the case for a very long time now, just look finished and I have no hope of a comeback.

They've just clearly fallen out of favor with TT completely. It's got to be so frustrating for Puli and Ziyech to be slotted in as midfielders this game for 25 minutes when the front 3 looked abysmal. Werner was injured for 8 games last season, Ziyech for 1, Puli for 10, Mount for 3, James for 8. I give you those comparisons because Timo played a shit ton last year and so did James despite being injured for as much or more than Puli and WAY more than Ziyech. Clearly TT doesn't favor them so they want to be shipped off.

Edit: Seeing Newcastle put 3 past Man City today makes me even madder. A middle of the table team put 3 past the best team in the league and we get blown out and can't put 1 by a team that barely survived relegation last season. We fucking suck. I'm pissed."

Genuinely don't feel like I'm watching the same game as you guys. We got hit very effectively on 1 counter.... That is not being over ran. Tactically was our best game this year.

Reece is class as usual. Chilly put in a good shift and looks to be getting fitter and fitter.

Glad nothing happened.,[WHAT UP NOW HATERS?!](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqY_tSzWwAANcAv?format=jpg&name=medium),"Pre-ramble comment: i'm not PotterIn or PotterOut. I'll fully admit i'm on the fence, even if recent results and playing styles have left a lot to be desired, which i'm going to go into a little more discussion about.

**Potter:** if he does go, who do we replace him with? 

I know there are some big names available right now but there's a few factors that would influence whether any would join us. Next season without European football is an increasing likelihood, so would be able to attract a good calibre of manager? Is it a short term deal or is it another five year deal?

It's been banded about that Boehly is here for a longer term project but getting rid of Potter would clearly show the opposite. Does that limit the pool of managers interested in joining the club?

**The squad:** whilst some blame (or whatever you want to call it) should be aimed toward Potter, his squad selection and playing styles a larger portion should be aimed towards the squad. 

They're the ones on the pitch making decisions and determining the outcome of the game. Okay, yes, if Potter is making substitutions or changing how we're shaped during a game that has an influence, but these are clearly talented players who should also be able to take the initiative and change the outcome of a game. Sometimes you have to divert from what the manager/coaches have said and takes things into your own hands if there's a chance of it working.

**The fans:** social media, of course, is a rather fickle echo chamber. One day a player will get praised to high heaven, another day they'll want them out of the club. 

It's totally understandable that there's an incredibly high level of furore because we're not winning games, and many fans aren't used to us not winning games. They're rather privileged that they've only experienced near total positivity at the club.

What currently doesn't help is not even attempting to back the manager or the players at all. Yeah, I get you're frustrated and whatnot but sometimes you have to take the positives even if there's far and few between. Take today for example, okay we lost to a managerless bottom of the league team. The stats didn't fully reflect that which shows we're actually creating *some* chances again and we saw some players return from injury which allows better rotation for players who are dead on their legs because they've had to play far too many minutes in recent times.

Fans also have to remember that even though the talent we have and the money we've spent is massive, sometimes it doesn't always click from the get-go. It might take a few months to hit the ground running, which is absolutely a painful thing to type out, but is part and parcel of the game sometimes.

**TL;DR:** more questions than answers about the manager position; all players should bear some responsibility of current form; fans are fickle.","Obviously a lot better than we've seen in recent weeks (months...), but let's not get carried away about 'deserving to win'.

https://imgur.com/a/oXcyyM3",Sack time!,😂,"Honestly I am really upset with the 1 point from that game, but I did see some sparks that hopefully we can work with. As well as some players who just aren't it.

First the negative. Mason and Gallagher made it nigh on impossible to pass through the middle. Enzo dealing with the EXACT SAME THING that Jorginho had. Get through the press, give it to Mount, back it comes! Forcing us to go wide. Cucurella needs to shape up, he still looks all over the place. He should be one of the ones who look better, he's worked with Potter before.

Now the good parts. CB's looked solid, Kepa looked good, Enzo seemed to be trying to get it forward and did play some lovely long balls. The wingers today looked a little bit hit and miss. But Sterling and Madueke looked really good, some nice control, running at players and such. 

I was surprised not to see more running from Mudryk. Was hoping he could light up that left side but just wasn't his day. Fofana looked somewhat bright, dueling well, making some nice runs, we just need someone to find those.

Lol. 

80th minute, still one nil down at home and there is a ball in the air in opposition penalty box. Not even a single player try to attack it even though ball stayed for 10 seconds in the air. 

Potter's squad selection is shit. And so is the fighting spirit in this team. Keep getting frustrated at 90th minute. No one remember that they had 30 minutes after the goal to do something about it. But nope, let's not attack second balls, let's pass around among defenders, no risky shots either. And then get mad at opposition for time wasting, like you won't do the same. 

God, I hate this mentality. How the fuck does every cross, every corner, every free-kick ends with players passing backwards? If there is no opening, force it. Take a shot from 30 yards and contest the second ball. Players keep trying to be the one not to lose possession that they have lost all the teeth in attack. These players aren't Chelsea lions. These players are domesticated cats with no claws.

Havertz is there cause we have no other option, Sterling is wasted as a 9, Broja injured and probably not ready to be a starter, Ziyech and Pulisic can’t play as striker and Mount is better than both of them usually even though today he was poor, along with the rest of the team. Either way, when Kante is out, we suffer. If we can get a replacement and phase out Jorgi for a better playmaker, the attack would improve in my opinion.

371,When my psychologist ask me why my depression has gotten worse lately I don't think it's unfair to blame Graham Potter. Fucking wanker.,Also the people analyzing random shots of players walking onto the training pitch to insist they had given up on the season.,Colwill also,"Our problem is tactical. We have one (1) pattern we keep trying, which is to draw them in, try to break the press, and look for a release. Even in injury time, 1-0 down at home, from a throw by their box we were feeding it back to the defenders to draw them out and start again from the back.

The problem with having just one (1) way of attacking is that it is ridiculously easy to defend against. If you know what your opponent will try before they have even started, you’d have to be really, really shit to concede.

Variation is essential.

Occasionally we’ll make a chance out of nothing, purely down to individual talent, like that run Sterling made in from the right, or when Havertz bodied the defender on the left and crossed it in. But right now it is achingly obvious that any chances we make are *despite* our tactics, not because of them.","I’m not lighting the torch for Potter to be gone yet, but since he took over…he has won 9 of 23 games (winning percentage 39%) Chelsea have won just 2 of their last 13 league games.

Pulisic and Havertz are too lightweight for the premier league while Zakaria was flagged by Juventus due to how crap he was.

Nice goal by Havertz,,Haha,Fucking cunts,"and all of which have only gotten worse under Tuchel, despite the fact Lamps only had about 5 months to work with them (bar puli). Werner actually used to take players on, hit the post, link up well with Tammy under Lamps. Kai was able to create chances for Tammy and also support him. Even Puli was able to provide a goal threat when linking up with Giroud. Hudson Odoi was at least able to take players on and rack up a few assists then, too."

Fair enough the attackers were here before him, but every single attacker was elite in their previous team/system. And there's enough diversity to test many different systems from werner to lukaku to ziyech.

And lastly, even if he wants to stick to this system and needs compatible players, his targets have been questionable to say the least. Just chasing Auba as the main striker, who has shown similar mentality as lukaku. Gordon, who has same playstyle as werner. And for defence, 90m for fofana..."

We can't score from set pieces anymore. We never go long and hope to use the pace of our front line. We barely ever shoot so we can't just hope that we score though taking loads of shots.

Main things I noticed:

\- These new signings are actually class. In such little time, they're already impressive and it genuinely seems like our scouting team has improved immensely. Early doors but a genuine positive. Madueke, Fofana, Enzo

\- Enzo Fucking Fernandez. You could've fooled me if you told me we signed him at the start of the season. He's had 3 fucking days and you could already see what every Benfica/River Plate fan was saying. Can't wait for him to get fully settled

\- Glad to see Reece and Chilly get minutes. Fair play.

\- On the negative side. Some of these players are too comfortable and aren't worthy of the badge. It hurts to say but Mount has been fucking awful for too long, he should be begging for a contract not expecting one. Havertz started okay but it just seems like he's not interested. Gallagher isn't ready but we have no other midfield options. 

\- Cucurella, what a waste of money.

I genuinely cannot tell if Potter just doesn't have a clear tactic or if it is a culmination of all the shit we're dealing with. Injuries, new players, having no choice but to play deadwood, etc. Two shots on target is inexcusable.","I don't think I would make such bad subs in fifa at this point.

We are way to easy to score against. It feels like every mistake leads to a goal or a very dangerous chance. Although Mendy has had a very rough start but I still have faith in him. 

I feel that we are making way more passing mistakes. Simple passes that are intercepted very easily. Also miscommunication. 

As for the players I think Chilwell has proved that he should start when available. Cucurella can be very good but he has had a rough start so far. I have faith that he can become very good for us like he was for Brighton. 

Sadly I have a lot of doubts regarding Gallagher. He exudes the right spirit and is quite similar to Mount in some ways but I think that his Technical ability is lacking. Everytime he gets the ball it seems to be hard for him to control it. 

I love Broja! Very strong amd technical and very good acceleration. He's like a race car going towards goal and he is very focused on getting there.",,I'd love to see a Kovacic Jorginho RLC midfield.,"What a fucking game boys!!!

Mendy absolutely bailed out by VAR to secure 3 points but id argue we were well overdue to benefit from an attrocious var decision.,,and we got him for free,Literally a foul an offside and a handball in the same goal sequence how can it ever be allowed?

B2, Silva solid. Not enough from the full backs but understandable as we are trying to ease in James and Chilwell.

Enzo great performance. Double pivot with Kante or as an 8 with a DM would unlock a lot in our attack.

Left side wasn't great with Cucurella, Mount and Mudryk. Everyone was taking up each other's area. Kind of hard for Enzo to switch the play to the left when everyone was all over the place. Just need to gel a bit more with Chilwell instead of Cucurella for our CL games and it'll be fine. We have Maatsen next season as well.

Gallagher and Ziyech was okay. Kai was unlucky not to score.

Disappointing but team needs to gel more. We will look better soon with one starting midfielder and a strong bench midfielder in the summer.",This pissed me off so much I had to walk away…went to the pastry shop got some treats made it back in time to see the refs fuck us!,And then you see Mount passing the ball out wide when he is in a goalscoring position,"He does have amazing technique tbf, he just does all the simple stuff so well he only needs to use it when necessary.

As a Chelsea fan, after 2nd goal I have hoping we would lose 4+ goals, so just this cunt would get sacked.

4- manager change

Negative: Fulham had the better midfield today since ours was only Enzo. We were never fully controlling the game as the stats implies and had no plan of building up. These are more or less because of new signings' intergration to the team and our injury problems.

Love the guy and I think he’s a top 5 lb/lwb in the world but we can’t really start him and cucurella at the same time. I feel like the sport is a bit behind American leagues bc they don’t have the fortitude to sell high bc top 4 implications aren’t so important, but based off of what Boehly has already done, I think we’re going to be league changers",,"Same story every week with Loftus Ass-Cheeks, looks good but can't score. Time to stop starting him for someone more capable then","Fuming would be an understatement. Proud of the boys and Tuchel. Refs are more often than not shite, but this one was over the top. Disgusted to even watch highlights back again",there is reason RLC scores once every 5 seasons and getting passed on by 4 our previous mangers.
407,The majority of Chelsea fans wanted Potter because he's English. Ya'll got your wish. Clearly and utterly out of his depth. Also let's not act like Abrahmovic wouldn't have sacked Tuchel for his shit start to the year as well.,Hear hear!,i looked down at my phone to see the latest shite in the match thread,Will we get relegated?,"Agree with all this except for Havertz. Had one good ball to Felix but was otherwise extremely poor. Can’t win a header outside of our box, constantly bullied off the ball, no conviction when he drives toward goal, slows down play immensely at the wrong times. 

I’ve supported him since he got here and it’s not his fault he keeps getting played as a 9, but he is atrocious in that position. I think he should be rested when possible, and then given some games in literally any other attacking position",A lot of teammates not on the same wavelength in those last 10-15 minutes. Understandable given the quantity of new faces. I think that’s something that could reasonably be expected to improve moving forward.,100% there is no way Tuchel wouldn't have done better with these players.,Spirit of Gerrard lives on in the Anfield pitch. We were slipping all over the place today,I hope we are wrong about him and the players.,">Players are shit,

Wait till you see the manager.","Seems like a concentration/awareness thing with him. Look how easy Silva makes it look, just reads everything, knows when to pressure and when to drop off, doesn't rely on pace etc. 

Koulibaly is just too rash and aggressive in certain situations. Also the pace of the Prem makes it more difficult and probably takes time to get used to. Silva is a harsh comparison I guess because he's one of the best ever but Koulibaly has definitely been disappointing.","There’s actually none left now to play down the left

Unless pottermopts for mount",,"If I am being honest, Potter has to take a lot of the responsibility. We haven't performed well ever since he has been here. I believe that we should give him time, and we should see some more cohesion and tactical nous to our team by the end of the season, hopefully. We also need to get our transfers right. I believe the club are trying to hire the right people for it. A lot depends on our manager, and today we did not compete tactically. I think this season and even next season might be difficult for us to get top 4, so we need to set up a good foundation for the future and that starts with getting our transfers right. Hopefully, Potter can get things right since I am a little worried since he has't proven himself at the top level, but sometimes that patience can get rewarded. I'm not convinced but I believe he deserves time and let's see where it leads us to.","This would be the ideal situation really, Boehly and Behdad going back with their tails between their legs and begging him to come back. 
Give him full reign and tell the players to get with the program.",Ziyech actually played really solid when he came on. Are you so embedded in herd mentality that you can’t even recognise a good performance out of the sheer bias you look with?,"Yeah, I would be pretty upset if one od our players did that. Don't know if I agree with Potter on that Chukwuemeka sub.","You can see Broja's talent, but he wasn't having a good game.  He definitely grew into it a bit, but he missed several passes that sent him through, and a couple opportunities to put it on a plate for his teammate.

He's still learning and he looks like he'll come good soon, but he just isn't there yet.",,,I'm starting to question everything now. What do you expect from a pivot of Kovacic/Mount? That's never working in any game ever. I wish I understood football more so I could just know if our players are this poor or if Tuchel needs to be in the spotlight. I hope it's the former cos trying to find yet another manager and rebuild yet again is gonna suck. I still have faith and we all have to remember it's a rebuild regardless. I just didn't think it would be this bad,,"Ow please. If you've been on this sub for sometime, you'll know the amount of vitriol that gets thrown Jorginho's way",,"I won’t be too negative because this is nothing to do with Potter. But with the packed fixture schedule our depth is going to be a big problem.

We don’t have enough quality cover at RWB, CM and across the front 3.

After the International break we have a game every 3 days until the World Cup and we are in a position where we need to be winning games quickly to stay in the CL and top4 race. Our first choice depth is RLC, Ziyech, Gallagher etc, I personally think that is weak. And no disrespect but we now have an inexperienced manager (at this level) to deal with all of this.

Spending 20m on guys like Chekwuemeka (not his fault) who is not near first team depth level just doesn’t make sense now.",,,,Joke,"Broja is fast af. I don't know how can anyone say he doesn't have the speed. He always get the 50/50 ball first, and when it a 50m race broja always win.",,"We need another quality midfielder way more than most people realize. If Tuchel thinks we don’t, we’ll, then he needs to open his eyes.",What is the deal with all this horrible refereeing? It’s crazy how many times that bad calls go against us.,The one where Ruben cut into the defenders in front of the goal?
408,I wish Ziyech got sent off then at least we'd have an excuse lmao. There's no defending this lack of desire.,Any of the other 7 that qualify,Guess which 3 games are the only ones I’ve missed in the last month? The only ones we’ve actually scored,"We have about 100 passes, 5% pass success rate, and two shots fewer than other big clubs per match. It's hard say it's bad luck when the midfield just cannot organize itself.",We always look better against teams that play higher up the pitch. Low blocks is our kryptonite.,"Feels bad, but positives from the new boys who came on. Madueke and DDF had loads of energy and Enzo looked class.",Nah Tuchel ball sucked he had to go it's just the replacement hasn't shown any better yet.,Wasn't that Gallagher at the last end unless you refering to Mudryk last pass to him?,"Yes, of course integrating a system takes time and consistency. But what exactly is the system we are working to integrate? Is it a high pressure system? Is it a counter attacking system? It is a position and short passes system? The frustration of our fan base chanting for Tuchel isn't just for the poor results, it is for the manner of these poor results. We don't see effort. we don't see strategy, and we don't see players fighting for the team.

As for the injuries, how can we end up with 11 injured players? Is it the Physio Team?  Is it Potter rushing players back to bail him out as happened with James? Is it the training workload? I mean.. Zakaria played 4 games and now he's out. Something feels off.

I agree, we started strong and then fizzled. We concede with individual errors but we score with individual errors too. Of course our XG is higher, we are playing Fulham, and we lost to them for the first time since 2006. Yes, people wanted Chalo to play but after 60 minutes it was clear he needed to leave the pitch. Potter took him out 7 minutes too late.

I know you are trying to approach this rationally and I hope you are 100% right but I can't approach it rationally at the moment. I am simply furious.","Agreed. We all think of Mount as some sort of KDB. He’s had like 14 months of being pretty fucking average. Yeah, he’s from the academy and blah blah blah. But that doesn’t entitle him to skate by being mediocre. He wants world class wages? How about a good performance every once in a while?","Striker curse is working it's way back the line, reached the defence now",Also tiny. Skinny. Going to have problems with physicality of this league,,"It's fucking ludacris that we replaced Willian first with 'Mahrez from wish' in ziyech and now with this 'English Willian' in sterling.
How the fuck did our scouting go so wrong so often?","Agree, no blame on Trev he is making the most out of his talent unlike some. No movement on dynamism in the midfield as you say.","I missed it too. After reading a bit, Potter started Pulisic and Sterling as Wing Backs, and he used a back 3 w/Cucurella for some reason.... and Kai was used as a 9 instead of his preferred false 9 role and Auba and Chillwelll we're on the bench when they should have started. Potter today=smh.",at least we didnt lose so there's that,Well it's also heavily influenced by the fact Brentford dropped very very deep in the last 20 minutes. Their good attackers had come off by that point and midfield was very tired looking.,,,Can someone tell me what happened to Mount? I don’t get it,,His replacement RLC was far worse but I dont see him being thrown under the bus. And I've been on this sub for a long time. I know the amount of hate Jorginho gets around,,I missed the game - was there anything to be excited about?,,,,Havertz offered very little.  Puli even less.  Much rather Hakim with sterling in the middle than havertz or puli even sniffing the pitch,Never lost faith,,I want some of what you’re smoking,"Shitty result, but really happy with the teams performance. Thought everyone looked really good for the most part",That was Mount
409,These pottheads act like only potter can turn this team around and no other manager we could bring in can make this squad better,And I’ve never slagged off Cucurella!,Maybe this is it? We've played 3atb for so many seasons that it's ingrained in our style of play. When we play 4atb we don't know how to press or control the midfield nor do we stretch the opposition wide enough to make space. Three at the back is glee at the back!,If we are lucky we'll get 5 more points this season out of a possible 42. I don't see us winning another game. It is what it is,"Yes, but lot of people here will still blame Potter","We don't look like a team, it looks like it is 11 strangers trying to play football individually wearing the same shirt.",give me Mourinho round 3 just for the fucking chaos of it,what the absolute fuck is going on with that Liverpool pitch.,"Yes, he's an unknown entity in the dressing room. His usual post-game comments doesn't reflect the appropriate ""We are Chelsea"" attitude.","He scored one goal, let's not pretend he was good either.",6 points from the last 21 on offer. This is embarrassing stuff.,He has passion but unfortunately he also has Barkleys slow decision making.,,Sterling’s ball in behind for Havertz was a better pass than Mount played all game (all season?),"This is the worst take ever considering our pivot is the most susceptible to being sandwiched by their front line and midfield, jorgi as the DLP is the most likely central player to be suffocated, and he spent all game fucking slipping and flopping. 

If we had it your way we wouldve been absolutely demolished 3/4-0 if they finish half the chances they would create off of that.","Go back to playing fifa, clown.","awful game lol, really one of the worst I have seen in awhile",But Havertz is a Ramdeuter. And he's being played out of position. He needs time.,,,"Well, this should be a fun post-match thread. Sigh.",,Jorginho being blamed for Fofana's mistake? I will be surprised by this take but this is r/chelsea after all,,Ready to kill it in Europa League haha,,,,"A pattern that I've noticed since Tuchel came is that most of time when the opposition is a goal or even two goals behind, they apply high pressure, get by our midfield so easily and score sooner or later. It's happened countless of times. Brentford at home, West Brom, Leeds at home, today, West Ham away, Tottenham this season, Wolves last season, Brighton both times last season, United away, etc. etc.

It's not a coincidence. His tactics around the structure of the midfield are predictably easy to play against. You can tell that opposition coaches love the fact that he uses Jorginho. All of them target him with their tactics.",His ACL is finally ready,,Yeah he was invisible first half today,"The fact that we had 64% possession and 3 more yellow cards and the same amount of fouls is absolutely comical. Like sure we jorgi should be better, but the hair pull is even more ridiculous. You’re telling me that they didn’t deserve one yellow card that whole fucking game?","He loses the ball immediately no matter how many defenders are on him. 

So far for Chelsea he’s played as an 8, 10, right wing, 9, the inside forward position behind Lukaku, in a front 2. And in none of those positions has he shown anything that suggests that he is a 80 million player. What system would get the best out of him? Where would he play?"
410,Imagine having the likes of Pochettino available right now and not thinking they would be a way better fit than our current coach.,But then we lose kova :(,Tuesday,"Anyone talking about the game or just Potterout. I could see we lost, need to know how we played stuck watching highlights.","Yes! How?! Our attack looked so fluid and I’d say we looked the better team. We actually looked like a coherent outfit for the first time in a while. 


Really promising signs, and I totally agree with you. On another night those chances go in, we win and the narrative is different. 


I actually feel optimistic after seeing that performance against a good Dortmund team. There’s progress starting to show.",We only really looked good in the opening twenty and I’d say that was more because the world class professional football players were up for the match.,Sunk cost fallacy?,Yep thought we actually looked quite good and moved it around well.,"Exactly. Our goals under Potters are just random deflections or a moment of individual brilliance (rare with our players). There's nothing in the field to give us hope that we are building towards something.

To be fair, we had a similar issue with Tuchel. The difference is Tuchel's pragmatic approach to each game. He made us solid defensively as he worked to build our attack structure. It wasn't great to watch but realistic enough that we managed to draw/win. Today, we are weak across all positions. Losing to Fulham and getting destroyed by Man City B team.",Unfortunately not many comeback after that kind of injury :/,"It’s between Liverpool/Newcastle for me, ETH has United firing on all cylinders now",Don’t think people were complaining about the passion. More about the performance,,And Mason mount. Why does he always get left out. He’s been here the longest too and hasn’t improved at all.,"Many idiots in this sub/fanbase were calling for his head.

Absolute shambles",We cant play 4atb with Jorgingo and TS. People wo dont get this should not be alolwed to comment. Like you literraly dont understand anything about our squad.,He barely got on the ball. He was positive though and won the corner that led to the penalty,Deserves to start 5 in a row 😂 you can't bank em mate,,,"If you are shocked by this result and can't believe the level of performance you have not been paying attention. 

The manager needs to be under scrutiny, under performing players need to be dropped, the players need to show desire.",,"No i meant he and havertz hadnt forgotten their shooting boots at the internationals. And i was more referring to their techniques. Havertz in particular, that sublime ahot from outside the box, and now he is back to being allergic to taking shots again.",,"I think like many here might say that if Mendy plays today there is a chance that the goal doesnt happen. Yet i also believe that there is a fairly large chance that our play is entirely more erratic throughout the pitch due to it. I believe Mendy might win us individual matches due to his (talking pre afcon) shotstopping, However, i do believe that if this team wants to evolve it needs a keeper that is more than just a shotstopper, and as it stands that keeper is for the moment Kepa. The defence looks much more comfortable with passing to the keeper when he's between the sticks compared to Mendy, with Mendy we look overly reliant on individual moments rather than a collective progression. I know Kepa is at best a controversial figure amongst the fanbase but i believe swapping him out for Mendy due to a goal that is mostly on Silva and Azpi would be overly reactionary. I think if the club wants to stop being a reactionary team and being a progressive team that imposes their style of play onto the opponent then until we find a worldclass ballplaying keeper, i think Kepa is the better option at this time.",,,,"West Ham have far more physicality and aggression than our players, we are 100% going to lose the midfield battle against them.","Lets not ignore Havertz either. Took him 15 minutes on the pitch with an actual #9 on the field and already scored a trademark first touch goal by arriving for a cross. 



If we're playing with a striker, he has to start.",,Just out of form,That was one of those ruin your day type of results but I’m just going to take the positives from it and move on. I think we played well and can go up another level. We have a couple of players that we are linked that can help out. If those get done we’re going to have a good season.,"Other teams has a 1.8 metre striker option.3 nil down and Chelsea is sending pulisic to try and head in crosses. And the proper cross only came at about 84th minute 

Why isn’t chelsea playing hoofball"
411,Cant wait for 2 days later when the pro potter posts start coming out,People were saying potter out when he didn't sub Mudryk in while up 2-0.Gotta just accept many of the fanbase are clueless,🥺🥺,What stage of grief are we at?,I've had blue balls for a while now. I'm getting concerned for my health.,You can't just throw the ingredients together and then expect your meal to be tasty when you eat it. You gotta let it cook.,"Whats a long leash? I think Potter gets to the end of the season, beginning of next season at least which is long by Roman standards. I think Boehly is more committed to seeing out a long term vision than Roman ever was.

1. Most of the important signings are done. Where we end up in the league while as important as ever will not dictate our summer transfer window drastically to the point where we sign anyone.

2. Potter still has UCL in his pocket, and that was something he earned on his own. Love or hate Tuchel you can't say he had us playing particularly better than Potter is now in the games running up to his sack. Lack of patterns of play in the attacking third, sideways and backwards passing, sloppy errors & conceding silly goals. It's the same shit, but you can't take away Potter going on a 9 game unbeaten strike to secure us top spot in some recognizable fashion.

3. Who the replaces Potter mid season? Do we have to pay out Potter? How much is new manager going to cost? Is that the trend we want to set? That's a mess I feel our owners would rather avoid, at the cost of Chelsea having a down year considering we are coming out of a legitimate injury crisis.



I wouldnt be shocked if Potter got sacked, but I do believe he has far more leeway Potter Out folks would like to admit. It's not so much hope, as it is big picture. That does not excuse him from not delivering, but there is more security for him under Boehly than under Roman.","This! People really need wake up and see this, first time we played with a full weeks preparation and lots of signs of progress and optimism .",What a really funny joke. You are good at humor. Very good. Dolt.,With the 1 goal he scored all season? This sub overrates Cobham products soo much it's laughable,"The way we’re playing we should be happy with top 10.

Absolutely awful.",I’d much rather see Gallagher in at this point than Jorginho,,"What about Mount whats his position cant control the midfield hasnt been effective anywhere in attack this season, seems like new contract has deflated him.","Yeah it sucks, I hope with the right technical directors in place, Potter will be protected (though I imagine he's more agreeable than Tuchel anyway) from that kind of stuff.

I hope Potter gets time but if he loses the dressing room and/or the crowd it will be a very rough time for everyone. The world cup break will hopefully alleviate some pressure for him and the squad.","The thing is we've had a great run of results but not performances. Brentford, Villa, United, Brighton were all better than us. Palace didn't deserve to lose also.","Because he was shit when he came on?

Didn't think he'd be the absolute lowest but he offered very little",I didn't know big boy was so quick!,,,I'm officially all in for TT out. There is something wrong at the core of the team.,,Never said anything about Havertz.,,We got lucky with that goal.,,,,"We have a midfield full of Ross Barkleys. Good athletes, talented footballers. Can win the ball, can run with it, but then when they do they have no fucking idea what to do with it. No creativity, no vision. We badly need a Fabregas.","Fofana definitely had a great debut, but I wouldn’t call him faultless. He got rinsed by Benraham for that Cornet chance that hit the post. If we’d conceded that, would’ve been a totally different story from the game",,Haverts and Loftus Ass-Cheek bots,[extra damning angle of Romero grabbing cucurella (how did he not get sent off??)](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ),Well Cho is the youngest among other attackers and also free. So there is less pressure for manager to play him. Just send him on loan already.
412,We better buckle up! It's gonna be a wild ride until the end of the season!,"I’m with you - football fans have a short memory. This is just one game (albeit a great one). Fulham wasn’t a convincing performance for me. Obviously rooting for him to win, but I’m not going to forget the past 15-20 games just from one big result",Came back how I had hoped Reece would,Yup Potter is gonna be our manager until the day we battle for relegation,Which curse? We won the competition 2 years ago.,"Enzo looks like the real deal. He could be that nailed on starter midfield boss for years like Casemiro for Real in the past or somewhat Kante for us before his hamstrings gave out. 

Madueke also looks pretty dangerous with his long legs and reach. Can be a great successor to Ziyech in that RW spot.

Badiashille is still looking to be that no nonsense solid CB that we thought KK was gonna be. If he stays healthy and develops, he is first 11 material.

All I’m saying is, despite our poor form, we have loads of new talent and possibilities at our disposal not to mention Felix too and Nkunku coming in the summer. Most of these signings are super young, coming to the most competitive league that they’ve never experienced, and its not like they’re coming in to a current top 4/title-winning side. Theres loads of pressure and that can stifle the gelling of the team with so many new players and challenges to deal with. Its all on the manager now and if the players can stay healthy. 

I will wait until next season to spit hellfire with my pitchfork in hand. For now, imma let Potter cook. Could be something really good for the years to come.","I liked Potter at Brighton but always thought it was too soon to bring him in and now he's suffering for it, he's certainly not helping himself either.",We played well.  Score line doesn't reflect it accurately.,"I disagree about looking more controlled, but he did almost give away a pen (though it would’ve been incredibly soft). 

In my opinion, Jorgi with Zak and Kova works better than any 2 of them combined. Would love to see a midfield 3 with Kova/Kante/Zakaria if they’re ever healthy at the same time.",I pick jenas,bet the owners already have written this season off and hopes we look way better after the summer.,Exactly,,"Don't try to absolve the passion merchant Mount from criticism, bang average player who gets undeserved hype.","What you on about do u have short term memory or something, we have been shit since last November even the pre season was shit so stop. with stupid bullshit that u are spitting",This is some generic bullshit you are throwing. Instead we are talking about how on earth potter insists on 3 atb when we don't have the players for the system. He fucked up multiple times on the basics. Sorry but it is a bit hard to trust sb who fucks up on such basic stuff over a small period of time. You can be as patient as you want but potter has made some huge gmhuge mistakes,Great teams pipe this United team like City did.,Yea we could have had like 12 low crosses blocked or scooped by the goalkeeper at least with pulisic in lol.,,,Noone really stood out for the right reasons.,,"Its not that he was told not to, its that in the TT 3-4-3 the wing back is the one who occupies the touch line and pushes him in closer to defenders where he very often receives the ball with his back to goal. It's hard to get yourself turned around on the dribble and beat your man when starting with your back to goal. 

He excels at running at his man, so receiving the ball out on the touch line allows him to do that immediately after receiving the ball.",,Didn’t get to catch the game. How was Auba and Ruben? Also was there any explanation to Koulibaly and Fofana being left out?,,,,Virtually 1 and a half days left in the transfer market and the team needs so many issues sorted out. Embarrassing.,Spend 60m to unlock Chilwell. There must always be goal scoring left backs at Chelsea,,Seriously. Havertz has been horrendous. He shows a little hustle and does well off the ball and everyone is sucking his dick again..,New owners. Same bullshit from Taylor. I would love new ownership to ask why this keeps going on especially since they are just coming into this injustice.,"This. CHO think more of himself than he actually cares to prove on a football pitch. I wouldn't be surprised if he's shown attitude towards tuchel and got himself frozen out of the squad. The hints he keeps giving about finding gametime elsewhere don't help his case at all.    
He needs to get his head straight on, and perform for the badge the way mount and reece do. The examples are right there for him in terms of 'how do I get into this team'."

No attacking patterns of play, cant score many goals, defensively we look all over the place, midfield devoid of creativity, players getting injuries and not able to get a run of games, Manager who at best has been dealt a rough hand but looks out of his depth and ownership who thinks the answer is just ""buy more players""

Newcastle brought in a new manager and a handful of players and they look miles ahead of us because they bought into a strategy. Arsenal probably spent about the same as us but all under the banner of a Youthful Arteta strategy that invested in the right players and they are dominating.

Not good enough for the money spent!",Yeah lol exactly,,"I mean auba was bought for tuchel, just to be sacked a week later, bright business","Well put.

Dinamo Zagreb. 17 days of hell.,,Honestly the setup under Tuchel never allowed him to because Tuchel preferred wing backs create the width and have his wingers tucked in. If you notice on the Gallagher goal Pulisic was completely isolated on the left side and given space to work with and run at people. I think that's when he's at his best.

I think the third kit was worn against Burnley away last year and it was a win",Gallagher doesn't show for the ball either. Neither is a pivot player,"Are you serious? He’s actually good at linking up the play but brentford at home are a good team.

He's a huge liability against any team that presses just like the guy above said, and it's been clear since 2+ seasons now. We need a replacement for him asap to fix a gaping hole in the quality of our midfield vs competent sides."

Do they have stipulations in their contracts that allows them to be sold transfer free if their club relegates to the 2nd division?,HE WON CHELSEA THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUEEEE,Never any doubts in signing him. He's a great player.,That was absolutely diabolical. I can't say anything more than that.,"We have something close to a team finally, and we're still missing some important pieces. Chilly was a huge step up, and can't wait for kova and Zacaria to play.

Honestly, we had a couple very near goals and they scored one from an incredible individual efforts plus we played in one of the most hostile stadiums to a very in form team. Not too disappointed.","I’m very whelmed. Mudryk is great if we play the ball on his side. Seemed like James and Ziyech were trying to get all three points themselves. 

I could live without Kai or Gallagher.

I'm not sure tbh though. It's clear that we have issues, and contrary to what a sizeable number of people think, selling of Puli, Ziyech, etc, won't fix that.

416,Potter shows why nepotism in football is toxic. He is so clueless.,Loved this.,That's how you get a result at home against this Leeds?,Why did he sack tuchel.,I don't remember being this excited about Chelsea's future in a while.

I know everyone is saying it, but my word, it’s been painful. Maybe that’s the plan for west ham before champions league but something needs to change.",Yeah I don’t even like Kepa but to quote Big Worm “it’s the principalities behind it”,,"I agree he was awful in the first half today and for most parts in the season until now. But he was brilliant in the second half. Winning headers and crucial fouls to let us have a breather. Do not forget he was involved heavily in our 2nd goal.

I personally think he's wasted in the current possession based system that we play. You could see today that he's best when we play quick football on the transition where he can use his pace and passing ( he was the one who found cucurella before his lay off for Sterlings chance that hit the post). Shithousery or not you can clearly see he's up for a fight against any defender he faces unlike Werner or even lukaku who couldn't win a single duel against defenders for all his upper body strength.","The best combination of play today was displayed by these two wonderful men of this beautiful game. Man the communication and understanding between these two are unquestionable and praiseworthy.

It was clear how dangerous he looked in the rare times he was given the ball.

That's why he shouldn't have come off so early. Give him some minutes with Chilwell and see. Then adjust after. 

I have no issues with noni sub, even if it's for mount or Ziyech.","Havertz was good before he got tired, excited for him to linkup with Felix and Mudryk in attack. Unlucky on that offside.

Mount was horseshit again, it’s getting absolutely worrying because regardless of what position he plays I often completely forget he’s on the pitch. He looks miles off the pace right now.

Ziyech was okay—tried to do things but his execution was a bit off. Still, looks a different player since the WC, glad to see him reveling in space on the right.

Mudryk was electric despite being short of match fitness. I want to see him a little more physical and to press a bit, but that jinked run into the box had me out of my seat—some player he looks.

Auba is washed as fuck, can’t hold up the ball at all and doesn’t compete for headers. Would rather see an academy striker when Kai needs a rest, truthfully.

Chukwuemeka needs new boots, his slips cost us two points. Promising player but doesn’t seem especially composed right now, think he needs some time to develop before he can be a matchwinner for us.

Gallagher has a battery in his back and Timberlands on his feet, liked his first half and was screaming for him to come off in the second. I don’t think we can afford to have a CM who gives possession away so often in our team though. Not the player I thought he was after that loan to Palace.

Hall must think he’s still playing U18–trying to get the craziest passes off just gave possession back to Liverpool. He’s an incredible prospect but needs to be coached about the risk management side of the game. I thought it was just him playing out of position last game, but he was shaky in the pivot like he was at LB.

Jorginho was excellent, smooth, composed, and reliable. His critics are completely out of their minds, he played out of his mind in the second half helping the defense. Anyone complaining about progressiveness from our midfield should be pointing the finger at the THREE academy midfielders playing ahead of him.

Azpi was slow as ever, but so composed to help us see out the point. 

Chalobah was great before he got another fucking injury. We are cursed, anybody who shows the ability to play even a tiny bit of RB is destined to go down.

Thiago is just sensational, build a statue of him outside Stamford Bridge.

Badiashile is class as well, composed on the ball and aggresive in the air. He made our usually toothless setpieces look dangerous near-singlehandedly.

Cucurella was fine, much better performance than the early season but missed a few one-twos with Mudryk—guess it’ll take some time to grow understanding between them. Still, a performance he can build on today.

Kepa was as good as he’s been, good saves and claims. Not a load to do as Liverpool were utter dross but I never get nervy when he’s between the sticks now, and he doesn’t give me a heart attack with the ball at his feet like Mendy does.","Don't disagree but we need to see SOMETHING before the end of the season imo, the guy looks totally clueless",Need to have a serious conversation about Kai. Literally Gifted a goal for no reason,we'll be lucky to finish 10th with the football we are playing.,Lmao... Harsh but true..,,"I think it's a lot more on the midfield rather than on the attack.

Ultimately we lost to a very motivated team today, on a day that we were overly sloppy at the beginning and lost shape towards the end but we also didn't take advantage of many good situations we created, it wasn't all bad imo. Glaring holes in the squad and team show up more when your best players are missing, that's just the reality right now, the world cup might just be a god send","""fucking shit United"" who are in good form and have made both Conte's Tottenham and an otherwise unbeaten Arsenal look absolutely silly in the last month.

-Sterling proving to be a decent signing.
-Ziyech may be one of the worst players we've ever had.
-playmaking seems a lot better so far, getting more forward movement on the ball.

Overall, decent first game in charge from Potter, been a noticeable improvement in performance from the team, but still lots of work to be done.",,,,Front three of Sterling Broja Ziyech for the next game.,Also Havertz looks revitalized playing alongside a striker who can keep defenders busy and he has freedom to roam in box,,I thought you were talking about Mount when reading on and had to check the name again.,"Anthony Taylor aside, we need to sign Auba right away. Kai and Broja are not the answer.","Maybe idk.

But the reports are that we are the ones who turned down Jesus tho"
418,Emotions are running high here tonight but once the dust settles from todays results I hope we can agree it would be lunacy to sack Potter. He’s been here 6 months. For once let’s just show some patience. Give him some proper time and throw our support behind him. Those calling for his head need to give theirs a wobble and show some loyalty,He got (as another commentor put it) dog-walked by Kovacic all game. He had him tracing out proper circles on the pitch so I'll take that instead,Thank you for your service,"You have too many unhappy players on the roster. Too many injuries. You just spent a fortune over paying for two very young, very unproven players who already struggling to adjust to a more rigorous Premier league. Neither has looked like they were worth the price tags. Mason Mount is imploding. Sterling/Kova/Chillwell/Fofana are in poor form after being hurt. Pulisic is hurt. Buba is frozen out of the team. Havertz still can't score or stay onside. Ziyeck can only cross the ball but we never have anyone on the other side of it. Felix seems to be in the early stages of the Chelsea curse. We are playing a back four and James doesn't seem to be getting forward nearly as much as he did under Tuchel's back three. None of the players or fans have any reason to respect Potter.",So our best performance was a loss,"Just arrived home from the Bridge. Havertz is terrible, shouldn't be anywhere near a starting 11. He should've scored 2, but we end up drawing 0-0. His all round game has nothing to it other than headers or tap ins. When Mount got subbed Havertz dropped to 10, and still shows nothing. He's not good.","Even a lowly FM player knows the value of talking on the sidelines.

the performance was somehow the same as under tuchel, no improvement yet. but i want to give potter the time and credit he deserves so i wont judge him until spring. i really hope that one month off now allows him to form a proper chelsea that is able to dominate opponents and create chances much more often. still, xG of 1.40 against a team without their regular CBs and without a real DM (seiwald is usually #8 but since camera left to monaco and LGD is not at 100% he plays that role) for one half is a bit disappointing...",,,,"get a cdm ffs

420,"The drama in this thread is getting out of hand, so let's just state a couple of facts. 

1. We're not getting relegated. It's for the very same reason why we're not getting Top4. There's too many teams between us and relegation, and more importantly the likelihood that West Ham, Wolves, Leeds, Everton, Bournemouth or Southampton will all pick up 10 points more than us within 14 games is incredibly unlikely. 
2. We will however, finish around 13-15, which will be our worst result since the 80s. 
3. Potter will not get sacked before next winter. There's too much good faith for him within the club and he has shown too much within his career. Especially since throughout his career he was always a very slow starter. (DISCLAIMER! This is not my opinion, it's my reading of objective reality.)
4. All those saying that 'we need Rice/Caicedo/whoever and we're a world class team' are very optimistic. Our recruitment will be severely hampered by finishing in the bottom half and our financial ability will be much lower. 

If you can't take the above, take a break. Spend some time with your friends and loved ones, go for a run, read a book, whatever. You don't have to watch games and get upset constantly. it's your choice. Football is supposed to be \*entertainment\*.

He looks like fucking pidgeotto.,Yeah I’m also happy we wom,This is low-key Putin’s fault.,"It's undoubtedly an unpopular opinion, but that was a good game by us. Miles and miles better than anything we've shown since the World Cup. First time we were effective on the counter. First time we were building up consistently. Koulibaly was much much better, got caught a couple of times, but much better. Ziyech is having his best stretch since he moved to Chelsea. Selection was good and the tactical setup was good. 

It might be a loss, but I'm happy. A massive step forward. Is something beginning to click?",What is the purpose of buying all these players if the manager is given time for them to gel?  The whole point of buying them in the first place is because we are in dire straits and we need points now.  Seems to be a bit of a paradox.,"How you lot *still* blaming Tuchel?  Took Dyche 2 days to implement his style, and 6 months later you lot are still trying to drag Tuchels name through the mud.  Get a hold of yourselves, its embarrassing behaviour.

Something has been “off” since Dec 2021. Our midfield and attack are disjointed. We had a good run of form in the first half of last season because our defense carried us on both sides of the ball - attacking and defending. Our defenders scored a huge amount of goals last season which falsely made us look like title challengers. When the goals dried up, our impotent midfield/attack was exposed, and it hasn’t been fixed.",The sky reaction was the most gibberish I’ve ever heard. Every pundit chatting out of there arses. Not a single legitimate bit of analysis. Just cliche and hot air the whole time.,Because the manager  wants to build up from the back so you need midfield to link.

Commentator's hinted at it, but our most creative player at the moment is Reece James, a fucking RB. That's scary. Some serious overhauling needed over the next couple of windows.

That was a wonderstrike from Gallagher, and he deserves 95% of the credit. But Pulisic occupied/moved four players with his little run and we don't score without that.

Yes Chalobah had an awful game but I have no doubt Cucurella would have another one of his disasters if he had started instead.

Then we would have been raving about how good we were in that 1ast half instead about bitching how bad we were in the 2nd half.  It's a game of fine margins. We still have a shot at a Europa League spot this season as Spurs are god awful themselves. I saw enough against West Ham offensively in that 1st half that makes me think we are moving in the right direction.

Football is a game of tight margins, and when you are under the ice like we are, you just don't get luck with these type of decisions though. The era of SAF, Mourinho and Conte are over though, they would not be successful in modern football, and Mourinho has lost his touch and Conte, Simeone are struggling, because their way doesn't work anymore in the modern day football.

There is a project going on from the boardroom to grassroots level, just because we spend £600m doesn't guarantuee that it will be a straight success. I agree though, there are better managers out there. But Potter knows the country, he has a track record of building teams and clubs. He has a track record of improving players. He is not here to be an instant success, he is here to lead a project started by the new board and build a consistent team that can challenge consistently. Also to implement a philosophy at the club instead of us just taking on the managers philosophy that we hire.

Name a project that was started without any issues. It took SAF a long time to win with United, it took Klopp 4 years before he built a great Liverpool side.

For me the player that I'm really happy to see taking more of an active role was Gallagher, he was showing up and being present looking for the ball.

3. Reece james is basically our new eden hazard. Unfortunately azpi is not it as a consistent attacking threat down the right hand side anymore. Defensively dodgy today too. Quite concerning how much we clearly missed him
4. 3 ATB may be a way to go for a lot of this season up to next season - especiqlly if we get gvardiol.
5. Virtually no midfield protection is dodgy. A lot of defensive/mendy intervention was needed to stop score getting worse.
6. The players individually aren't awful but clearly love playing against big teams or with a fire in their ass. Bring liverpool today for example and the performance would be different. But here there was a lack of urgency - i wonder if winning 6-0 here a few months back got a lot of these players complacent? And then falling behind people are scared to take risks - we are mentally fragile and only put it on the line when there is nothing left to lose (like real madrid last season).

He has the drive and determination too",Draw is fair.,"Don't tell that to this sub, too busy being blinded by his flashy dribbles.",,,"Actively trying to get the manager fired, we've reverted to man utd last three seasons",,"I’ll stay wherever I like.

I love living in Leeds, and as unpopular as it will be saying in the Chelsea sub, I love how much Leeds as a team means to the city, even if I am far from a fan of them."
432,Leeds fan here...Potter IN!!! (at least for another week please!),"Much like your username.

Kai 🤝🏻 Toni. Silky Germans with massive balls on big European nights.",There’s only so many more times they can keep coming back like this lol,This is their first cleansheet in the PL since October,"We seem to be getting ""unlucky"" every match. At some point we're going to have to accept that it's not luck. It's not even Potter or building team cohesion, that's starting to form. It's the fact none of our players could finish their fucking sentences nevermind shots.

BvB GK had a great game today but Chelsea should've scored at least one.",So we spent all that money just to struggled for a draw against Fulham?,Hansi would start a dynasty,"He’s never terrible. Just not the midfielder we need. He plays too slow for us to play with any sort of dare. It’s clear when we do try it and lose the ball we just get burnt back the other way. We need to have some sort of confidence that if we play risky passes there is a chance that the dm will win the ball straight back, and Jorgi doesn’t offer that",He might resign for the sheer fact that the money isn’t worth the stroke he looks like he’s about to have….,"You could see the players were quality though



We had Eden, cesc, costa, matic etc

So much quality. This current lot are dire",Pretty sure Potter is worse than AVB now on results,Yeah that was a shit moment!,,Makes you want Jose back. Dudes tactics are ancient now but man can he make warriors out of players,Giroud walks into this team,"The future of our team needs to be built around James, Havertz, Hutchinson, Colwill and Charlie

*Edit: Add Fofana and Chuk to the list as well",[deleted],Who would you play there who we have fit then champ?,,,I wonder if Reece was smiling in frustration before the last free kick after Ziyech told him he will take it again,,"mate, nobody is slandering Mount and Kai because Pulisic isn’t playing. We’re slandering Mount and Havertz because they’ve been shambolic",,Only for Ziyech to miss the sitter.,,,,"Not saying im Tuchel out by any means but he has got to adjust and modify his tactics before the game and perhaps IN game if things are not working. He must stop relying on players he likes such as Havertz and Mount, they both deserve to be benched, play players in their correct positions, and get a MIDFIELDER!!! i hope to god he was keeping his cards close to his chest when he said  we dont need another one as we clearly do.... our excellent Midfielders are injury prone and the rest are not at the levels we require",We need to do the front two with Kai and Broja.,,I think he has some dirt on Tuchel. He's not going anywhere,"I'm furious, but trying to take the positives from today
- RLC was fantastic! So impressed by him
- So happy for Koulibaly scoring a banger on his home debut. The guy makes me not miss Rudiger
- Cucurella is exciting
- Seeing Tuchel's emotions boil over as much as mine gave me a feeling of solidarity","Overpay then. As much as ""PL proven"" and such are shat on Cucurella has immediately made an impact. Better to overpay for improvement than get a ""bargain"" that's doing nothing."
433,"I am a united fan, and I want you to keep potter as long as possible, which should tell you what you need to know lol. I think potter is a good coach, but it was never going to work, it’s a bad match.",Kinda like how we once theorized that Pulisic only does well when the weather is warm. Havertz only does well when he hears the Champions League anthem.,It’s sad that they are pulling a Leceister as a top club - Man City meanwhile are winning their games convincingly in second,It's a process mate. Yes we are currently 10th but we are working hard every week towards relegation. Trust the process.,Won't if these donkeys still can't finish.,Looked like Fulham was fighting pretty hard to survive the match.,"He deserves it, he has been absolutely woeful. Worst manager we have had since AVB. No actually, Potter is worse. This is Chelsea, it's in our DNA to sack managers if they don't perform and that's something that predates Abramovich. Since the '70s no manager has lasted more than 5 seasons in a row. 

Been saying it since he begining, he is out of his depth here. 

Potter out! Potter oooooooooout!",Was often sitting as a lone DM and was very composed and in control at both sides of the game in that second half. Massively agree.,I believe that player money is different than money they pay to managers because of FFP restrictions. I could be wrong on that though,"that was coming off no investment and other factors

this year we sacked a manager after 6 games, hired a mr nothing personality and spent £300m 

this is tenfold worse",The Brighton that just got smacked?,No.,,If we’re gonna play like this why not just get the youth out there just to see if we have any youth talent. No direction in this club.,Chilwell isn’t the same player he was pre injury,Had some really good runs where final pass was a bit too much to handle as well.  Just hate how team will have a good 10-15 minutes then play 30 without any identity or plan.  Hopefully team balances out so we’re not so dependent on Reece or Kantes fitness to get results.,"We were the better team for the end of the first half, but for the entirety of the second half both teams weren’t good. Our only shot on target that half was the pen",azpi can play rb if we play a 3 man midfield and support him correctly,,,Broja should have started. At least he had some drive when he came on,,"Damn, we really didn’t get our monies worth from that deal lol",,"yeah, and why is he still on corner duty? he cant hit a cross past the first man, every fucking time",,,,Maybe now you’ll understand why TT wants Gordon. Someone who can run and get past a defender. Watching Our attackers try to run at a defender makes me feel sick.,I like this option a lot. Let’s Kai play in behind Broja as second striker type. I still think that’s his best position,,Didn't help that every time Mendy had a goal kick he gave the ball away,We need to sign a striker asap,"The blindness of this thread??? WTFFFF are you talking about. The negativity of this thread on game day is absolutely INSANE. Makes Man U’s look like a positivity party. TT has won us the champions league and I trust him to do it again. It’s not going to happen over night, but god damn, the bitching and moaning is unbelievable. That was the point of my initial post. A reminder that TT can and will win us trophy’s. — But calling for his head after a 3-0 game where we gave up two poor quick goals by PLAYER mistakes is outlandish."
434,"I still trust Boehly and by extension Potter.

We've had years of inconsistency since 2010, arguably since Mourinho's first sacking. Our mantra has been the players come first and managers are expendable, which is why we've got a bloated overpaid squad and almost as many managers as seasons in recent times. We need a total refresh in mentality and playstyle, and I think Potter *can* oversee that. Whether we're competing for cups over this time I won't judge til August/September.

If you started following Chelsea post-2000s (that includes me) I think you need to take a step back and realise how top clubs like City/Liverpool/Real/Bayern have thrived off stability while we've been chopping and changing to nick the odd title and European trophy.

How many shots have we had since the world Cup? Bordering a hundred with a handful of goals. Is that poor tactics leading to poor shot quality? Maybe. Or is it the same horrendous finishing we've been seeing from the same group of players for the last 3 years?","His big bald head was in the way of everything tonight, in a good way.",Kindly keep unrelated Arsenal talk to /r/soccer or their sub I could give a flying fuck about what they’re doing when we’re struggling to stay in the top half of the table,I didn’t have any fun reading that. You misled me.,"Can’t see us scoring more than one goal currently, but I think things are going in the right direction. We’re starting to create more chances and defensively we’re improving a lot. I liked the performance today and we definitely deserved to win more than Dortmund did. I could’ve accepted a draw but we were super unlucky to lose; we played well","The match was 3AM here, all I can remember is Enzo good, Mudryk kind a off/isolated, fofana with the drogba vibe.",Cucu-angry is blinding my perceptions,His best matches are when you don’t even notice him,whoosh,I find this one worse tbh,"Coming off the WC, I’m actually relieved to have skipped this game. Don’t see any benefit to my mental or physical health, sense of community, etc.",Yeah he was pretty good!,,"That's the whole issue. We spend too much. We overpay players for what they are worth and give them an over sense of pride. 

Cucu got here cause of the money. City didn't even bother with him for much less price. That's our clue to not buy him. We went ahead. 

Sterling was too City's reject. He was not a part of their starting xi. He thrived under a system that created tons of chances and he scored 2 maybe 3. That's another clue we overlooked. 

Chukwu is young but is a good player and we barely make gim play. Gallagher is on and off. Zakaria? I dont kno why we got him of he cannot a start game for us or pkays one match againstz Dinamo in what like more than 12 games. 

We bought injury prone fofana and he's out for weeks. 

We bought koulibaly who's been not impressive enough to be honest. But he's injured.",We also conceded goals left right and center before Potter,"He had very little help in the midfield. Dribbled well, cleaned up some messes by others and drove the ball forward.","I'm happy. Sucks to lose 3 points, but united aren't a horrible team. We looked good for the players we have",We also don’t really have a RW either. Pulisic and Sterling are better off the left. Havertz I’m not sure what he is but he isn’t a right inside forward. Do we really want to attempt Ziyech again?,,,Remaining toothless up front as per usual + Reece having a quiet night yet still has the biggest chance of the game lol. What a shite performance yet again,,"After a corner, but he stayed there.

But they were playing a lot of balls over the top. So that was a big difference. Changing it from side to side once in a while, etc. So we can start to see some changes in the way we play.",,His face is constantly like he’s just quantum leaped into a new body and has just come to the realisation he’s in a football match…,,,,"Most of the weak points have been identified, so just to add to the mix:

Sterling decision taking is at least questionable, I didn't want him to come especially due to this reason (I get that he is probably best if our attackers anyway, but those limitation rather won't go away). He got really good through ball from RLC then didn't know what to do with the ball. He missed great run from Mount just to earn free kick. He kept running with the ball into the crowd. Didn't really like his attacking output.",Where is Aubameyang going to play?,,"Loftus Ass-Cheeks was brutal. I've never seen a man get as open as he does and do literally nothing. He just doesn't have that clutch factor.

Sterling fed him a goal on a silver platter and he said nah","PL should enquire VAR about its decisions for today's game 

Both were controversial goals",I was being sarcastic. I think he should start. This team needs his directness in the worst way.
435,"I guess I don’t see the hatred towards the owner?  

The club was hampered by sanctions. He bought the club in a very weird time period with weird circumstances. 

He has spent 700m to try and get every young world class player he can. 

Tuchel was a thorn in his side, and frankly people were screaming to sack him earlier in the season. 

I think Potter was a poor choice. But in our history he just adds to a list of poor managers. 

But at this point the options are dire to replace him now. 

It’s shitty all around, but why are we blaming a guy that has spent close to a billion trying to fix things?",Thank you. Kouli has been FANTASTIC the last few games.,"I saw Felix make some good runs but didn't sadly didn't receive the ball on multiple occasions. One that sticks in my mind is his pass and go to sterling, but sterling cuts in and goes for a shot instead of passing back to Felix, who looks rightfully annoyed. On other occasions Felix would make a run forward but our players would pass backwards.",Where’s Hiddink when u need him,Agreed.,Thought it was an exciting game,"Lmao so true.

People just instantly forgot he played pulisic and sterling as RWB, despite actually having players that can play there.","Long time jorginho critic here but he was absolutely immense, easily best game for us in quite a while. His very controlling presence was a sharp contrast to quite a few games this season where he absolutely failed to instill any control or tempo in the game.",whoosh,"They’re both disastrous in different ways. Maybe hindsight will change the perception of this squad but 2015 felt like a collective complacency and then meltdown between the squad and staff. This time though I just don’t see the same levels of quality of the likes Costa, Hazard, Pedro, Cesc. Maybe I’m just too close to it and the assessment and injuries will be easier to judge in the spring or later.",Kepa was solid also tbf,"His set pieces were on point, except one where he hit it straight to the keeper... Overall he looked good..",,We do have a significant amount of money and talent in the hospital right now. But we should be more insulated with all we’ve spent.

Kepa

James - Badiashille - Silva - Chilwell

Mount - Chuky - Enzo - Gallagher - Cucurella

**Mudryk** was hungry and really showed his quality. He tried and you never saw him walking about, dreaming of coming home to shag my mother.

  
**Havertz** on the other hand. Well mate, between jogging lightly and standing static waiting for the game to be over he was absolutely worthless. Would honestly rather have **Morata** at front. He would at least be some form of a threat.",Why has Chelsea football become so depressing.,Neither is Conor tbh.,Hasn’t played competitively since November and was still better than all our other options lmao,"Where we started was that we were a cup team, that has not competed for the Premier League in five seasons. Mainly due to the fact that our short-term attitude has left us way behind our long-term thinking competitors.

I think sacking Tuchel was a terrible mistake, but two wrongs don't make a right, and sacking Potter is also a mistake. If we're going to try and build a long term project, you don't just give up after one bad spell.",Felt somewhat hopeful though as we still had proven world class players,"Thiago, Cucu and Kepa were solid but the rest were god awful.",You can see it in his demeanor he's actually quite pumped after the WC and is keen to prove himself. Pressing well and trying to reach every ball. I just wish he was on the end of the chances Kovacic seems to keep finding himself in,,"Unai Emre to villa & we have graham Potter (respectfully). We can’t keep bringing in players that don’t give a shit about the club. Kai, auba, Sterling. Best players Jorginho azpi Silva (outside of mason), it’s insane to think we let Leicester sign a top CB for less $, West ham bring in a proper defender & a striker that does the job, Leeds bring in a better version of Sterling. We go for players who are too cool to press up top… fcking  contrast between gab j energy & auba is fucking disgusting. 

Bring in players like that around Mase & Mase will stop running cuz he’s doing it by himself. 

This is too much for potter. Wish we could ask for tuchel to come back or Beg Zizou. offer Carlo an ungodly amount of $ or bring in a promising guy from Germany. We have good pros at the back but need life up top. If Haaland can have success bring in lukaku. People didn’t realize the value of Timo pressing for 90 mins goals or not. 


Potter has gotten too much wrong. We’ve gotten rid of better managers for less, we’re fucking with 8th place",He plays like a youngster.,This.,OMG me too but from 2021 in the run up to the Champions league that was fun,"We practically pulled it off under Sarri and we have way better fullbacks now. Reece - Trevoh - KK - Chilwell is completely fine. Plenty of teams play with 4 atb with worse defences than that, we just need to stop being so risk averse.",,,I'm numb,,"Na cos Dani Alves and Maicon existed at the same time as Cole. Game already had changed during Coles time there and Cole was a pretty high flying full back at arsenal in particular.

Cole was the best left back in the world though no doubt. But James doesn't get beat defensively often and is consistent, while going forward is as good as the likes of Alexander Arnold. 

James the last season and a half has been at that level. The only real issue now is longevity.

I feel like people hold the old heads to such a high regard that they don't realise how good the new gen are. We got this same thing with Hazard when he came when he's easily the best forward/creative player who's played for us.",,"He’s sabotaging his own contract so he could get the trade he wants, forget whichever manager we have",,,,I’m in napa in wine tastings and just scowling right now.

And it was 0-0 when that happened.",I’m pretty sure this could be solved by not playing Kai as a striker.,I thought this worst days were behind us,Mudryk had a good game. He was wasteful a few times but a few times he created something from nothing. Happy to see him improving the kid is going to be dangerous,Noni Madueke.,I mean sure but with Enzo already pulling DM duties what is stopping Carney from playing an 8 with Felix at the 10?,He’s reminds more of Bale. Eden’s has a lower top speed and center of gravity. Mudryk’s acceleration and top speed are both impressive,"They weren’t Tuchel’s players when we won a champions league either.

I’m sorry but you don’t get to take charge of Chelsea and say until I get 11 brand new signings to make it my club then I’m unable to motivate them or implement a pattern of play.

That’s just plainly not good enough","The drama was super toxic, still there was a recognition that without the drama we could beat anyone, and the team showed real fight both against psg in the ucl and against spurs to end the season. We sorted out the drama in the summer and ran away with the prem. We don’t have that energy about us club just feels flat",Ziyech was brilliant as well,"Hall of course i get why he didn't play, but the thing is now he has played vs man city away and should have had two goals and was a beast in league cup, then he played away in newcastle and did nothing wrong, then his next game is after Cucurella got minced all game long and there was no other choice and again looked perfectly fine vs these top sides from this season. Tuchel didn't need to play Hall because we were playing a 3-4-3 and Cucurella at wingback is a differnt player in that system and he had a fit Chilwell to be fair. 

Zakaria, Tuchel had him for what 1 week? He came in on deadline day and he was sacked literally 7 days later lol. So i don't think you can use Tuchel in this argument. 

Zakaria had been training week in week out for Potter for literally months before he ""had to start him"" because all our cms were injured (Lofty/Kante/Kovacic were all out) and now when you see him play just like he looks from his 'gladbach days it is shocking how he hasn't been playing. Everytime Lofty was playing under Potter he looked shockingly bad and didn't bring anything to the game and we had this guy sitting on the bench not even getting minutes!!",,"How to attract when that Stupid Barca stole our target.

As soon as Broja came in Tottenham start to dominate even though Broja supposed to be fresh he run like he a dead man already. Broja to slow to linked up midfield and the forward causing Tottenham to dominate. I still prefer Kai over Broja.Broja doesn’t give it all even if for 8 mins of his game time.

Broja came on and the attacks just dead, Tottenham dominate in our half immediately","Even James gave up after the first goal.

We barely ever have goal-scoring opportunities, which highlights the few opportunities we do get, making it seem like such a bout of bad luck when they don't go in.

We're not cursed. We're just not making chances, because we have a shit manager.","After we conceded, we played some of the best football since Reece and Chilly got injured 1½ years ago. We dominated the game in a way we haven't seen for so so long. But our players are allergic to scoring goals for some reason.",I got drawn in again. What a waste of my Friday evening.,"I’ve been on the Potter train, but I’m falling off the caboose. I hope things start to come together, but I don’t really see it. Would love to see Hansi Flick as an option if Potter keeps going downhill.","Being Mudryk on opened up so much space… Milner was pressing really far up and we were on the ropes for a bit right when the second half started but as soon as he comes in, Milner drops way back, gets a yellow, and gets subbed off… and then TAA can’t push up as aggressively either. 

Aside from him playing well, the tactical impact of his speed is huge.","Never his fault, eh? Only Hall wouldn't be considered a first team player going into this match. Plenty enough quality to beat Fulham but sure, maybe next week when we go 6 points from 30 it'll be his fault.","Having a good manager is a necessary condition to fixing this team. By itself it is not sufficient. But that doesn’t mean we should just let a bad manager stay because we have to fix multiple things.

The only reason to keep him is if all the top managers are avoiding us because they know we’re fucked.","Agree on azpi. We often looked like we needed an extra man to cover him while defending, and we lacked a player on the right side when attacking. Massive liability now.",Alonso was also solid defensively when he needed to win a duel and head the ball to safety.,, It that 38 year old man would be the best player on a lot of top teams,"Yeah but you have to pay the rest of the contract if you fire them, it just seems like we are splashing money all over the place when it needs to be used wisely","almost all our our line ups under him have been weird, sometimes it has worked sometimes it hasn't","He was a wanker! He was laying there crying because he knew he wasn't going to the WC, not because of the actual injury.

My question is, how did ManUre get the drop ball after the stoppage?",Saw shades of prime Hazard icl,,,BALD CUNT TUCHEL OUT,,"Ashley Cole was incredible for us. Won so many trophies for the club, too. Reece James is a baller but he’s not even close to Ashley Cole yet",,He is sabotaging the team.,,,,"He didnt play well either

Constantly dispossessed and holding the ball too long",he wasn't even bad lol,,"yeah tielemans has always been class, idk why we don’t go for him","Anthony Taylor helped to what may be the easiest draw of their season.  That said, Anthony Taylor isn't reffing every match, but our players have to perform.  I thought Jorgi was obviously indecisive throughout the match which eventually led to one goal conceded, I also though Koulibaly was a bit shaky in possession and pushing forward.  However just about every other aspect of that match was fantastic from the boys.  Cucu is looking like a fantastic acquisition, RLC was in a fuckin mood today.  Amazing to see, definitely excited for the season ahead with this performance.","Yes but it has just started....We played bad got 3 points vs Everton, played out of this world vs Spurs and got robbed and then played awful today. 

Its not like that was our peak and we got blown away, we were shit and got beaten."
441,"Now to refresh this sub for another week, hoping that Potter has been fired.",Yeah he has a monster game. I liked that he was controlling the center of the pitch and was legit on the end or challenge any long balls from them aggressively. It honestly reminded me of Rudi.,3 months? Boehly will give him 3 years after this win,That season was absolutely horrible and yet we are reaching those lows again….,"Yup, 2-3 off the bar and one off the line for us",Same….. on to the next anyways,"Honest question, how long do you think Tommy Tactics or Pep would have needed with this squad to beat a team like West Ham? I legitimately think you could hand Pep this squad one day in advance and he’d be able to beat a bottom table team. Expecting us to beat City right away is one thing but I don’t think truly top tier managers need that much time to get basic results.",Mudryk kept Liverpool’s back line honest so they couldn’t squeeze into our half without worrying about his pace. That ended up giving our midfield more time on the ball too. Him and Felix could make us very dangerous if we can finish,"He had one good half against City and couldn't get on the ball today. Fulham midfield ran rings around him. If that's our best mid, then we're in trouble","Very well said and I agree to an extent.

But if Pep was leading this bunch of misfits. It would be considerably better.

I mean even Tuchel did well with such an awful squad, granted at the end, results and performances were poor, but half the players on the field had their foot out the door, so isn't a reliable way to judge.

Changing manager isn't going to magically fix anything, but having someone with a proven track record who can show they can do with a pile of turd is the person we need to rebuild Chelsea.",Azpi was pretty good in a back 5 as RCB in the tuchel era,Watching him play is painful,,You let your pets run riot at home quite frequently it would seem,"We've been bad at creating chances, but under tuchel at least we controlled the game. We were able to play out from the back etc, now we just look clueless",We are giving teams free space down the sides of the pitch by playing two wingers who play better closer to the box at wingback. Either play Chilly at WB and one of attackers as wingback or switch formations completely.,That Casemiro goal is not a regular save. Saving that goal is a save of the goddamn season,"TBH if he had done it at half it might've been a ""you are on thin ice"" moment for Havertz, while simultaneously showing trust in Puli. I'm happy he gave Puli as much time as he did, but Havertz was just awful today, and has been for a little while now.",,,"Can we give Ziyech a 0 rating 

He should never be allowed to play for us again",,ashley cole was miles ahead,,He's tanking his own value so Chelsea have no choice but to sell him cheap. He's livid we didn't just give him away for free back to Ajax. I know Potter wants to be fair and give everyone a proper evaluation but I don't know how you can play Ziyech again.,,,,Only thing he hates out there is putting in a low cross apparently.,Yeah and people are shocked that puli was the best when he played with giroud,,Sense of urgency finally hit the boys?,"Thought RLC was phenomenal today. A bit too hesitant when he was in their box, but movement/positioning was great. It's a long season and we need players like him to step in with that kind of performance.",Lmao dude actually pissed himself even thinking about it

It's hard to implement your ideas when most of the key pieces in the puzzle are not available.",By the end of 2023 you mean until the end of CHristmas football and the January 2024 transfer window opens? Because if we do that we are writing off next season as well.,I think azpi is still reliable defensively. We should rotate koulibaly with azpi on the RCB position and get RLC or some body to play RB,Alonso is way better defensively and can score as well,,Silva’s age is catching up to him too. Not fast enough and been making silly mistakes in defense or at the back. Him being the ‘best’ isn’t an achievement at all in this horrible side.,Except the goal he gave up and 2nd he nearly gave up. Sure.,He’s looked fine in a back 2 this season,He got back and defended good. And carried the ball well once or twice. Didn’t really have much time to do anything,"Exactly, it was a totally different game in the last few minutes.  Broja has been destroying defenders with his end of game cameos up until now, but starting against a fresh back line is a whole different challenge.",,,"I missed the Tottenham game to be fair but when we were 1 man down to Leicester was the only time I’ve seen this team look like they mean business since preseason started. The fuck is wrong with these players, they don’t seem interested.",,Just some perspective James took Zaha out of the game cole used to do the same thing to Ronaldo,,"Guy is literally our worst signing from 2020 Summer  and I was most hyped about him lol

Overrated asf",,,,"Sterling was shit as well. How many ball he could have lay off to the wing but he decided to hold on and lose the ball. Man was selfish af. Even the goal he scored that was low percentage goal, he should have lay it off to ziyech for a tap in",Every time he turned there was nothing in front of him. This system doesn’t make sense. What are our attackers being asked to do? Dribble through 4 defenders?,,People act like Gallagher was playing in the Championship last year. Of course Palace isn’t on our level and it’s easier to get minutes there but he performed very well against the same teams we’re playing now. His decision making today was shit but I’m still optimistic about him and I’m surprised how many people are ready to loan him out again (as if we can afford to lose anyone anyway).,Been a while since a match has had me this upset,"This lol,we respect him because he gave his all and was a  one season wonder,which we should,but we need to be less lenient now and think rationally on whats been going on for like literally the past 8 months."

It’s like we don’t have any leaders or accountability, no identity no desire, just people who are happy to take a wage.",">We wanted to shed some wages 

And then replace him with Sterling who's older and shite and pay him more. Genius.","Silva will be fine in a back 2 anyway. Guys like Havertz, RLC, Pulisic, Sterling, Cucurella… they’re not gonna do shit in their current form regardless of formation","Honestly, I do feel like our set piece form both in attack and defense took a major downturn after his arrival. Disappointing.","That’s the point tho… he started and scored, yet didn’t see mins again til 11 days later",,,"That was absolutely tragic. So slow to move the ball throughout the match until Jorginho comes on. Absolutely zero urgency from so many of the players despite being 1 down for a majority of the match. Honestly this seems to show the lack of quality in creativity we have in this team. Somehow, Jorginho was the most creative player... shocking.

Ziyech was dire. Played both wings and was shocking on both of them. I love Mason, but he needs to improve. He's in the team to create but he was killing attacks today. Koulibaly needs to be a bit less rash. He has a tendency to go full in and then get's beaten quite easily.

If we're looking at positives, I actually thought Fofana was decent. The only thing I can think of is perhaps he should have gone long when Koulibaly went short, but his 1v1s were quite good today. Reece James as well showing that while we've spent a lot, he's still the best player on the pitch. Glad we've got him signed up for 6 years now!

I'm not sure there's a lot Tuchel can do with the current crop of players. He's switch the formation, played players in a variety of positions. The only thing I can think of is maybe chuck in some of the youngsters we've bought. Maybe see Chuckwemenka in a 4-3-3 with Zakaria behind and another midfielder, but I don't know enough about these youths to know if any of them are anywhere near ready.

What needs to happen is that we need to say potter is our man regardless of this season. Even if there's no improvement whatsoever. Either that or we sack him and give someone 5 months and Jan window to do what they need to do with this squad.

No one finishes every chance they get. 

The reality is that no, havertz isn’t our striker solution. That’s not where he feels comfortable finishing from. He likes to come in the box second and wait in space or run off of a striker to find space, not score in traffic while crashing on crosses. We don’t create much in attack and our chances are all very one dimensional because we have absolutely no one to play through the middle of the field.

Our first step is to stop conceding. During open play we were a lot more compact and organized. 

West Ham goal was a bit of sloppy defending on a corner. 

After that we had to chase the match. We were able to fight back and get 2. Overall West Ham would have been lucky to nick a draw. 

The match is definitely a step in the right direction. Once we sure things up at the back we will can build on that to start putting teams away. We also still have auba and kante to come back who will make massive differences. Plus kova isn’t 100% match fit. I’m reserving judgement on Zakaria as I haven’t seen much. But also could be influential.",,Mate those who didn’t give up on Werner were also delusional but Werner scored and created more than havertz so those holding out on havertz are even more insane,"Refereeing lunacy aside, my thoughts on the game.  

Kouli showing he's the real deal with key tackles, what more can be said about Thiago S, bossed it. 

Cuca was superb considering he's been at the club a single week, don't think he put a foot wrong and I like how crisp his passing is. Superb signing to only improve!

James dominated the right channel, immense play (Sessegnon is a liability so perhaps it was an unfair matchup).

Bar Jorginho's error he was imperious. Best player on the pitch beating the Spurs press over and over, they simply couldn't handle him until his brainfart, which unfortunately cost us today. My man of the match (sue me he really was great until the error).  

Kante had spurts of really good play today. Great contribution to our second goal, but over 90 minutes wish he had more impact. Unfortunately it is clear now he's not the same juggernaut he once was due to injury so we should look to cutting our losses. Love him and such a shame his career is being blighted by injury.  

Rueben was so good today on the right flank attending (attacking + defending), bossed that area and really limited Spur's attack while causing real problems. Great game.

Onto our attack, Mount hasn't really got going this year although he put a great pressing shift in. Loose touches very unlike Mason of old, but he'll come good. 

Sterling is a real firecracker. He constantly tried to create and was looking up for who to feed the final ball or exchange plays with, but unfortunately our unorthodox setup made that difficult so he often slowed down, rethought plays and tried to force things. Not his fault really, he would work so well with a proper no9 and better movement ahead but I'm thrilled with his contributions thus far. Just hope he keeps it up.  

Havertz was industrious today, really worked his ass off defend from the front and came deep to held in the build up play. He is not a no9, so I simply do not judge his as such. Wish he put that chance in the net because his hard work deserved some reward.

Conclusions:

As a defensive unit we worked hard and compact. Clearly some work is need in set piece defending but long term I am confident our back line will hold for the season.

As an attacking unit there is so much left to desire. Our midfield with all the control in the world struggles to transition quickly into attack and we get severely punished the second we loose said control and slip up due to errors. Build up is slow and hesitant across the length of the pitch, made worse by a total lack of unlocking quality (Fabregas etc), so we have little choice but to play down the wings. Sterling would benefit so much playing with a more traditional no9. Havertz shined most when he was involved everywhere but down the middle, because he is not a no9 and his strength lies more in buildup, this was clear from day 1 so really hope we look to change the system to suit. Broja has a future in this squad alongside Havertz and Sterling, if we are willing to sacrifice a bit of defensive cover.

It may seem like whinging but today we lost 2 points because we could not kill this game off. Spurs had no right to come back (again ignoring the refereeing), we had possession stats to die for, yet Lloris did not break a sweat. We pinned their defence back all game, but Kane and Hjorberg's throughballs were more threating than 95% of what we could achieve down the middle. We absolutely must improve in attack or we will continue to drop points and be the title race, even though we ""perform"" well. With Rueben and James pushing up so highly I am optimistic this was practice enroute to switching fully to a back 4. Because it is clear we need the extra body in attack.

All in all this will be a transitional season and thoroughly excited for what these boys can achieve!","Because nobody ever said, or claimed, that Havertz is a capable striker. Tuchel decided that. Imagine if Conte **insisted** on playing RLC up front for a year and a half, instead of just scrapping that idea after he was shit for like 3/4 games at it (which he did and sent RLC on loan where he did superb)?"

also calling him mentally challenged isn't necessary",100% agree with this. Even when Tuchel was here I wasn't expecting us making top 4. This team is just not good enough. I would just let Potter tinker and experiment all season and then hopefully by next year he can have a better idea what can win us games while the new recruiters/directors can bring in players during the winter and summer windows that can actually fit with what Potter wants. I also think taking a step back this year might be a good thing. It could further expose the players that are not good enough to play in the prem and it might even be a humbling experience for some of our players.,"Making a change in the first half is the exact opposite of stubborn.

Ivanovic was more like Alonso in his latter years, gets goals but not actually good at the fullback fundamentals, was more a decoy and heading threat than a chance creator type fullback like an Alves/Trent/James.

You could see what the process was, you could see what was working and what wasn't, where he needed to improve and where the team needed to improve.

Potter on the other hand there's NOTHING. No clear plan, no evidence where we're aiming to be, results continue to get worse, and i don't think Arteta was ever NEAR a 31.25% premier league record.

Kids? I've been watching us for 25 years, any manager that's performed THIS poorly has been moved on; Mourinho twice, Conte, AVB, Scolari, Ranieri... shit, we sacked managers that won shit with terrific records, like Ancelotti, Tuchl and Avram Grant... and Potters football and record is NO WHERE EVEN REMOTELY CLOSE to theirs.

He got better cohesion with academy players forced into the squad. Potter is just kick the ball and inshallah. Even when we win it’s by a lucky goal while playing like shit for most of the time. 

Potter isn’t on Chelsea level.",In general I think we've been more direct and quicker in possession.  Also the team attitude looks way better to me. Especially defensively. That being said the wrong players with the right attitude won't get any team to the top 4!,"I do want us to win, be lying if I didn’t. But it’s easier to watch when they’re having a crack (sound like a football dad)",,Potter is not the problem. Arsenal is the top team in the league for a reason. They recruited well and they’ve had a manager in place to build an identity for 4 seasons now. Potters been in for 11 matches. How about we calm down and give him time to build something.

And it felt like things are changing.",,,,Even if he wasn't looking good atleast he'd touch the ball,"I think the part that nobody talked about is that the foul isn’t in the contact, it’s in the rush towards the keeper prior to the contact. You watch Mendy’s head, and he pulls it back as Bowen is approaching. Bowen then kind of pulls out, but obviously not since he still makes contact. If Bowen doesn’t do that, Mendy makes an easy catch. 

I’m not sure that’s why the referee called it, but that’s why it’s a foul to me.",,Was thinking the same thing. Why was he put in such a position in the first place because had he not been on a yellow many people would’ve said he committed a clever foul and took one for the team.,"Coming from watching rugby this weekend to football really highlights how bad the refereeing is in football.

He’s no Reece James but he’s filling in really well in my opinion,,,"Chelsea right now looks like a group that, in general, don't trust each other and are afraid to make mistakes.

Appreciated Jorginho when he is good but criticism needs to be put forward when deserved.,,I'm pretty happy with this performance.

The owners have made it clear they believe in him and have invested into him long-term - he isn't going to lose his job this season, so how about parking the negativity to the side and observing and actually supporting the team?

The league form has been disastrous for years, not just this season. It's finally caught up with us, and I guess you could've hired another short-term option to paper over the cracks but why would you want that?

The rebuild has happened faster than expected (although not complete) so we will need to see improvements this season, but eleven days after the end of the first transfer window for the manager and recruitment team?

No crosses, no passes, no nothing.",It's a crock of shite as the same crop of players beat city three times in a row.,,"Our positional awareness is atrocious. We clearly are getting used to a new system, but we really lack the knowledge of creating space and finding the right guy.

It’s no coincidence we’ve fallen apart since his injury problem got severe.,">but I feel like we should start from strengthening our defensive structure before attack because it's Chelsea's DNA

We have defensive players like Zakaria who can shield the defence. Potter is not using them, he would rather pack the midfield with more number 10s and 8s. It's ridiculous! He has to sacrifice some players to balance the team defensively and offensively. For instance we don't need Gallagher and RLC in the same team, Mount and Havertz or Cucurella and Chilwell",We didn’t though,He was average like the rest of the players not named Kepa and Kovacic who were excellent.

I'm not going to argue this point much. It's obvious to anyone watching every week we've been flattered by our results under Potter and our actual performances haven't improved much, especially in the league.

It’s easy to see against someone like Marsh who is less tactical than Tom but more relational with his players and they believe in themselves and their role.  Klopp and Pep are also relationship oriented. 

Do you think that some of this might be that chelsea players lack confidence? Because that’s what it feels like to me. They’re afraid to make a mistake. So they don’t take chances. And that one detail is what causes their woes. Belief in your game is the biggest factor in success."

Are we allowed to have more than one?",,,,"Another proof that most attackers are set up to fail in this team. most of our wingers can't beat their man, and most of our players can't make a single accurate pass without either putting too much power in it or barely any and thus they lose it.

His profile is the type we need for the team. Physically strong and good in link up play. Broja needs to adapt to a possession system. So I think it's a good idea to bring in an experienced striker.  Idk if auba does enough link up play and if he's past it. I can't really think of a striker that fits that profile.,"Are you daft? My point is that even with kante and kovavcic when our midfield looks better it still doesn’t help our forwards, and when our midfield is jorginho and Gallagher there’s no reasonable person who should be blaming our forwards for not being able to go 3v5 against the defense who’s already set in their box. Literally the only times we looked dangerous were in counterattack when our defensive players started things because they’re more capable passers than our midfield. Even visually you can see the difference in quality between a James or cucurella pass versus anyone in our midfield"

Sticking with an incompetent manager is probably more ludicrous,"Lol, you're joking right with item 6? Ziyech quite literally became the most threatening player on the pitch when he came on. He was very forward driven, won a few duels, had a succ. dribble, placed a worldie of a cross any decent striker would tap in blindfolded, and had a few really good pass through attempts. And that's only in the 15 minutes he came on for. Yet you still want Sterling or Havertz to start over him?","Chillwell isn't particularly good either.

Average performances from Kai, Fofana, and Reece, but reece is gaining fitness. Mixed on Ziyech and Sterling.

He would’ve had us getting torn on the counter,,"I went for Tuchel for his stupid decisions and now I will go against potter for the same thing. No clue what they are doing. With Potter I can at least say that he's not that experienced manager and is still early days. Potter has been getting kucky in his first few games with the lineup. Today everyone said in the thread that it's a weak midfield and look what happened. 

Last year Chilly and Reece got injured and things went downhill. Now the same thing is happening. It's a bad system if a team relies on one or two players.

Started off well, had a couple chances we wasted and then Zagreb get the goal and we just drop off a cliff. Confidence completely shot. I just feel like this isn't Tuchel's fault. As I say, we seem to start games relatively well and this is surely when what Tuchel wants is fresh in the player's minds and then something happens or the game runs on a little and we seem to just revert to type with aimless passing around the box and nothing incisive. 

It's reminding me of what Neville mentioned with United at the start of the season where whenever something happened the players just fell back into old patterns and it feels like it rings true. When I watch Chelsea since Sarri really I feel like at times you're not watching the managers team, you're watching the players. I vividly remember games towards the end of Lampard's time that just felt so similar to this with no penetration through the middle. For that reason, I think we need to be extremely careful with how we proceed. I really don't think a new manager is the instant solution some think it would be and I worry that we would be put into a United situation going years without ever really having a truly positive season - and that would only be worse with how good City and Liverpool have looked the last few years.",,If we're not going to give any credit to Puli for a 15 yard dribble where he beat 3 defenders and passed it off for a shot then what are you going to rate Mount and Havertz for this game?

The attackers we got looked great in their previous teams but they simply didn't work here. Now that could be a variety of reasons. The coach, the league, the team. I can't point a finger at any one.

Imo they were bets, they just didn't pay off. So now we have gotta go out and try again. Get different players. Till now I've liked our window. Sterling, kouli and Cucu have been great signings. Even though today wasn't a great showcase for them, they are good players and I'm sure they'll prove it in the coming weeks.

But yes, the rest of the targets are subpar and I can't defend them. I personally feel it's more of Tuchel's need, rather than want. Like we need a forward,  a mid and a CB. 

Auba is a terrible idea, Fofana is far too overpriced, and Gordon is far below Chelsea standard. So yeah, I don't want any of them, but I can't go ahead and say we don't need any of them. Reece shouldn't be made to play at CB. Jorginho shouldn't be relied on as often as he has. And we just need someone, who is not Havertz, in our front 3."

But at least we score a couple goals there 🤡,"First leg Dortmund was pretty good too, just snakebitten and burned by the fastest dude in Europe","Get rid of this mid table mentality. A lively Leeds? They’re 17th and relegation candidates. We should have thrusted the sword deeper into them, instead we held on and scraped by. Utterly fucking toothless. How far we’ve fallen.","There's absolutely no identity in this team. No distinct patterns of play, no style, and no emotion. It's awful to watch.","The wins will come, we're just in our adjustment period. New signings, players returning from injury, building some cohesion together. The improvements have been clear recently.",Oh God how many times does Potter need to be tactically dominated for people to realize he is the problem.,"Agree but. Mudryk is still getting up to speed after not playing for a long time, and Ruben as well.",My stream dropped when Mudryk came on and I genuinely assumed he got subbed on for Mount since I hadn't seen him at all... stinker of a second half,Must be a Williams fan,At least Tuchel would still be around,"Honestly Ligue 1 has higher esteem than Serie A for me, the matches are tough, space is tight, battles are physical, flair players like Neymar get hacked to death, etc and we’ve recruited a number of quality players from there over the years.",Of course you’d like his lazy lumbering around.,,It was irrelevant because it was towards the end but sterling yellow on the rapist partey was more laughable,"All completely valid points that included the caveat that he wasn't excusing the performance and that it was fucking shit.

Fortunate that we scored on a corner. Another day it would’ve been a draw. Also i think the worst part about this is that Potter put on three defensive players to hold a result against 18th place Leeds.,The whole is substantially less than the sum of its parts.

Potter should be fired for selling us cucurella for such huge sum of money we could have gotten someone better with half that money",He probably won’t even make it to 30% this season,"Potter's solution to the issue is still a terrible idea. Out of the 3 tested options in that position, in RLC, Azpi, and Pulisic, the latter is by far the worse of the 3 at RWB.

At the very least, the other two would have recognised the danger when Estupinan ran in behind for their 3rd goal. Players like Sterling and Pulisic can not and should not bare the defensive responsibilities of a fullback.

Either move to a back 4, or play Chilwell and Azpi/RLC as WBs in the 5.",I don’t think we missed Fofana at all. Trevoh has been great. We miss Reece though and we should have played a back 4 from the beginning with another midfielder,What game were you watching? So many times they just barged into us for no reason.

Didn’t you get the memo? After another £300mil + £300mil in next transfer windows, the 3rd season is when Potterball will start competing for Europa League spot.",Yeah. I didn't really think that was an excellent performance. We simply looked like a team who wanted to play football. Nothing special. Bare minimum really. Wasn't fucking horrible of course. But it never should be.,Pretty much how it's been for a few seasons now. Individual performances carry the load but it's incomplete and can't hook it up for a full 90 minutes.,The improvements are there and connections are forging.

We look to he back to needing a striker, and unironically, Lukaku would have feasted tonight.","Changing managers every 1-3 seasons after the slightest dip in form is the reason we are here today. If you can’t suffer the low points while the squad is forming and beginning to gel then you don’t deserve the highs. I couldn’t care less about FA and Carabao cups this season. 2/14 is not great I agree, but there’s more to this than just points. The team is improving.

Most of our team was fine except for Auba and Chukwumeka...Hall had some mistakes but overall most of them played decent today,"There are so many angry people here. I understand passion - I've followed this club passionately for the best part of 18 years - but people who let football affect their mood to such an extent need to have a word with themselves, or take a break. 

I know it's difficult watching us be absolutely gads now, but we need time. A season, maybe 2? If there's no improvement by this time next year, then we should be thinking about moving the manager on. I'd much prefer that, than continuing the unsustainable manager carousel.

Must be immediately after a corner. 

And agreed. I'd say the last game the team seemed a bit more fluid but that just could be upto the fact that CP played better.

481,Sterling probably our best player which is saying a lot. Just nothing else to praise really.,"You missed my point.

Under all managers, a point comes when everyone thinks he will be sacked. For example, the game that ended Lampard's job at Chelsea was the beating we took at Leicester (I think it was a 4-0). The players, these players in some cases, didn't give a damn then. They didn't give a damn in Zagreb under Tuchel and in other games, especially at the start  of this season. The 'on brand' thing to do was to loose and wait for the new man to come in. They didn't.

Don't get me wrong, it's Potter's improved decision making and some semblance of order that will keep him in the job until the summer, but it is the players that kept him the job this week.","Is mixed feelings ok? Happy to win.  But long term we need Potter out as soon as possible. We can’t go into next year with him.

The 2 fouls are obvious, but the ONLY card Spurs received this game was Conte? Are you fucking kidding me? Jfc",Yea cause after the first 20 minutes we were running around without sense they had completely lost the plot. The system works it’s on the players not taking the chances. One criticism I have of TT is he didn’t have Mount drop deep enough today after looking good doing so last week
482,Good thing the final is today. Actually have a chance to watch 2 teams play football…,lol,"potter out. Relegation fighters Leeds should be a lock at home. Only after the final whistle did I think we had the win.

483,This club was doomed once Boehly decided he would do anything beyond signing the checks and fucking off.,"Literally on every topic that's not from Chelsea, people are complaining",This,Absolute madness from Boehly. The guy clearly doesn't understand anything about football and just wants Yesmen around him. The strength of Tuchel's CV compared to Potter's is borderline embarrassing.,"SAF said once that tactics matter until the box, after that it’s up to the players. It’s not on Potter, that nobody scored, but I see a good chance at the Bridge.",Feels like this bot just does this now to torment us.,👑,[deleted],Sure but they let their “great” player leave and got better. Kim is a huge upgrade. It’s not a coincidence they are doing better without him,"Do what their coaching stuff asks of them? Does the coaching staff ask them to miss hit every pass, make no movement and be shit? And yes, the coaching is still an issue as there seems to be no game plan but the players don’t even put in the minimum effort required, which shows in how many second balls constantly go to the opposition. 

And the modelling thing was mainly a joke, but the overinflated wages part is definitely not. You have players like Mount not signing a new contract cos they want 300k a week, when he has barely shown any improvement since his debut season. You have a destroyed wage structure where Koulibaly and Sterling are on over 300k a week. I think it’s ok to be angry about that when they aren’t even putting effort in, it’s disgraceful. They don’t deserve social media abuse and I’d never send it but ppl also have a right to be angry and frustrated, tho sadly it’s the case that people always take it too far","Potter won’t leave because that would mean that the board was wrong, and they are probably too proud to admit that they are. Like I respect what Potter has done at Brighton but coaching chelsea is a whole different sport, we need someone with top class tactics not someone who only knows mid table level management and tactics","Oh for sure. That's why I specifically added I'm not throwing shade at him. The others have *some* senior minutes at least. It's natural for us to want him to try and take it past defenders 1 v 1 but if you imagine yourself in that position, would you rather A) pass the ball back, keeping possession or B) try and take on your man, with a high risk of losing it, setting up a counter.

Pretty sure he will grow into the team, just glad to see him get some solid minutes and not a 1 min cameo when we're already 2-0 up and coasting (not that that's a common thing anymore 😂)",,Too late,"In the league, yes. We have however won two CL games in between those five, which might disguise the league form somewhat.",He was lucky to scrap draws and wins in recent games,Yeah he was proactive with changing the midfield I'm not sure he waited so long for changes up front.

484,people need to realize that boehly is the main problem here. he’s the one who hired potter and refuses to fire him. our standards have dropped massively since he came in and our results have went to shit. but it’s alright because he hijacks transfers from arsenal and gets these players to sign 8 year contracts 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪,How? The easy rebound was literally kicked out by an encroaching player.

I'm not calling him out but just saying this sub has been riding his dick because we got win. Potter is obviously good coach and he done amazing with brighton. But so far there still a lot of work to do.,regardless he has earned a start over Kai. Kai needs a break he’s struggling with basic first touches and dribbling much less chance creation,,,"The thing is, Tuchel out is the worst thing we can do, this is the problem we have had for so long, we buy to suit a manager and then sack him a few months later leaving the new manager with players that don't fit his plans, after spending so much we can't afford to change managers",,"I disagree, I think we're doing the classic penalising a guy because he does not play in a good team. 

Suarez and Kane should be in the top 5 premier league strikers of all time but they play/played for shitty teams that don't win trophies which diminishes their individual achievements, despite being players who win games on their own week in week out. 

The only real argument for Cole is that he played for longer than Reece James, but that's because Reece James is only in his third PL season as a first XI starter. Cole played for 12 years as a starter in the PL. Similar to the people who don't realise Hazard and Kante are the best players to have played for Chelsea, in the PL era for sure, they similarly get penalised for playing with crap players when they were saving our asses week after week.

Not a case of charity. Our attacks kept hitting their defensive wall and there was nothing we could do.,RLC can’t dribble and survey the field at the same time.

FUCK!,If Mudryk wouldnt understand that he has to defend for 10 minutes then there is something wrong with him,That’s like 90% in this comment section.,Seriously can’t even defend him when losing to this Southampton team. I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt with injuries and new players but this performance at home to a managerless team is nothing short of a disgrace,Also we cant forget how easily Dortmund played through us in that first half.,Done…,He hadn’t played a game since November before chelsea,But yeah I'd agree with the urgency part,"My point is who the hell do you expect him to play over the players who are currently starting?  The options are extremely limited, is my point.","Public humiliation on the world stage like this evening? There’s not much, which is why it’s an issue.

Now as you said  add him to multiple positions and you can sure as hell guarantee he won't have a notion what he's to do. He's clearly just not comfortable playing at the top level week in week out. He's an option off the bench to being on when winning, that's about it if we want to be a serious team again.","I have no issue with the timing, given the flow of this particular game. However, I was a bit perplexed by Pulisic coming on from Auba. It should've been a straightforward swap with Broja instead, someone else that was going to run channels and be a nuance - not exactly what Pulisic or Sterling are going to do playing in that position.

The other frustrating one was how Loftus-Cheek remained on the pitch for so long. The lad offers literally nothing beyond a couple of moments where he chooses to carry the ball, which generally ends in poor execution anyway.",Puli always looks at home playing a layer deep. He does better finding space between defense and mid than he does making runs from my observation.,,,"Sometimes i don't feel like i have the mental capacity to watch a game, but i feel like a bad supporter if i don't.",,In terms of legacy- absolutely. In terms of ability I think it’s a little close,,Puli in his ten minutes generated more chances than Kai did his entire time on the pitch.,,,,"4th? I barely see us top half if we play like this. No plan whatsoever. Seems like we were just passing it around trying to see is something opens up by chance. Plus we have literally zero senior strikers in the team so I don’t see it changing. 

Edit: spelling",Especially when it seemed like RLC was *trying* to get his second yellow...,,He looked a step slow and even had trouble completing his dribbles,"first goal wasn’t because of ref mistake, plenty of time passed between the bentancur challenge and the goal",Yea the issue was the pivot it wasn’t press resistant we needed someone like Kante or Kova there we need more depth there if we’re going to stick with a pivot otherwise we need to change that up
486,F it bring in Mourinho,Don't know if I could handle that stress hahaha,Yes Gallagher looked very good coming off the bench. Work rate was needed in those last moments.,"> Fuck him off

Not sure he should be rewarded for losing","Yes, the game was way too open at the start.  We created good chances but they also created some open chances.  We were too easy to play through in the 1st half.",Lmao you funny,Enzo is a much better *central* midfielder than Fabregas ever was.,"The crazy thing is r/soccer think we’re insane for criticising him, they clearly haven’t been watching him this season.","Mount has been forced to play well up the pitch due to injuries to our wingers. The few games he legitimately played as an 8, he looked good and we played well. Sure Ziyech or someone else should start over him if we need a winger, but why are people so quick to throw him out when he isn’t even playing in his preferred position?","He’s 47, so a 47-minute-long time out","I don’t understand Brighton at all. I’m a neutral btw, but Cucurella and Potter just seem totally different after leaving Brighton, Bissouma too, are things there so well oiled that after leaving that system you’re incapable of reproducing that anywhere else or what..?",Possibly just splitting hairs here but Zak was a loan. Wouldn’t mind if we bought him though.,,![gif](giphy|6oyMuvF0iy0T8UqPwg),"Switched to back 4 and he's not a fullback. He did well at wingback getting forward, but as soon as we went back 4 he got left in dust by Almiron and the goal happened. I'm not blaming him for Potter's decision to play him there. It was a very very bad decision.",He was playing CM in the first half and moved to RB in the second half,agree. potter is the reason we lost this game imo. fucked up the set up and got forced into an early sub and then also waited too long to sub attackers,Makes you wonder if u/JoeyBrickz was being tongue-in-cheek?,,,Chelsea football make me feel like death. good god,,"In what aspects of his game?
Feel like similar to hazard Reece gets penalised for being in a shit/average team while cole had absolute legends playing alongside him.",,I’m not high on Kai either but I’d give him 10 chances before I gave Ziyech one.,,,,We don't even play the same sport as City,No way in hell should koulibaly be on the bench.,,CLONE WHEN??,"The only thing I can think of is that the refs MADE A DECISION that they would not effectively end the game right there. We were winning, and they didn’t want to “taint” the game by winning it for us.",The final says otherwise

Take care!,His energy and determination off the bench is off the charts. Don't remember the last time I saw someone who could compare to it.,I’m interested in why this game made you think he’s a lost cause. I knew he was a lot cause after the first few games. I wonder what you saw that I didn’t see,What's Potters win % at Chelsea,When last did we score a goal?,"I think you got to give them this season just because of the squad overhaul and the World Cup. But if we look like this in September, pull the trigger.","He’s shit, needs to be benched and replaced with actual attackers until he can regain his form.",yeah this is my thought. he needs time sure and im no way saying he should be sacked tomorrow but we need to start seeing something positive in the next few weeks.,Doesn’t matter what lineup he was putting out this team wasn’t beating City lol we actually played better the previous 2 games and still lost. Also with all the injuries we have probably better off to get knocked out as the squad as stretched thin as it is. The performance was disgusting and everyone involved needs to be questioned but saying he threw the game is disingenuous we didn’t have much else to put out there realistically,"Who cares right now? Least of our concerns. I don’t know a Chelsea fan who doesn’t love Roman, but he ain’t here right now. Manager and current players are the major questions","He's just bang average really, poor signing",,"it doesn't ruin my day anymore

not like it did under Tuchel...

I stop thinking about it once the whistle blows",[deleted],I agree with your point and ist not like anyone thinks he's elite but the point is he's aying week in week out because of the aforementioned injuries and mismanagement of our midfield over the past few seasons so it's no surprise we are struggling in the league. You need to have an elite midfield all the time and that's not what we have.,"I couldn't catch the match but I've seen that the Kovacic sub was the one that impacted the most. As a Rlc fan like me, I wanted to ask you what made him the weakest link yesterday? I assume he played the box to box mid, as he was paired with J5","Good shouts! Chukwuemeka looked really good, he played the way you want your subs to play. Hopefully he starts getting more minutes.

Chalobah is probably our most consistent defender after Silva which is pretty wild!",,,"Crazy stuff. 

If new coach same problem in 2 years.

But I guess that’s how she goes.",,I think James would take Ronaldo out of a game too.,,"Really really have enjoyed Raheem since he joined.  He's been very fun to watch up front.  That run he made in the first half, think around the 30th or so, should've ended in a goal.",,,,"7/15 points is what you’d expect from a midtable team. Hell, even 10/15 points is below expectations for Chelsea.",Against say Liverpool I could see it. KK maybe not as aggressive +pace,,why only 6? What a plastic,3 mistakes on two goals. The first goal had the foul on havertz and then offsides interference,"Well there's 2 ways to show strength as a football player - you either learn how to better position your body/frame so you always have the advantage with the ball, or you bulk up and use literal strength to out muscle opponents. I'm often surprised to see players choose the latter and lose what makes them special in the process.   
Messi was never a tower in his younger days, and yet many top world class defenders will tell you he was ""strong"" on the ball regardless, and that's because of intelligent body and ball positioning.  
It's not just Mount by the way, its also Kai, he's gone down the bulk route too. Remember how Kai would slide in between defenders like a ghost, unnoticed, to score or at least be at the end of a chance in his first season playing for us? Have you seen him do that yet this season? Nope. Just like mount, he physically cannot anymore, instead he's been trying to barge his way past defenses and inevitably loses the ball and annoys himself."
488,This was so absolutely embarassing. We can't even keep our passes within the lines of the pitch half the time. The fact that absolutely 0 players are playing to their best and no fire in a derby match is a sign that something is completely rotting in the dressing room.,That doesn’t stop him attending the match,"You could really feel the pressure getting to the players lately, this win is crucial",Congratulations. You are not dumb anymore.,"Maybe people are Potter Out because of a culmination of the last 14 games and not just today..

And as the guy below says the goal is on Potter putting Enzo in that position so he do more by not setting players up for failure.",What goals,"I don't see the value of sacking him when the league is out of hand, just let him play out the season. Even if the results don't improve nothing lost. Though realistically he will get time until September or October given that we've invested so much resources into him.","Agreed man. I’ve been saying it for months, he’s been dog shit. He needs a good long rest.","Yep he wins us games almost single handedly, that is why he should be the future captain because our form goes into the bin when he isn’t on the pitch",Hopefully a loss at Fulham results in a sacking. It’s our only hope.,People prefer nostalgia to being good,"You are the melt if you think that bringing on Hutchinson,  Connor and hall against seasoned pros benefited the team in this game. We were dead after that. Not to mention he used up all his subs by the 69th minute. Do you ever consider that we have all these injuries from terrible coaching and planning? That was potter throwing in the towel like the push over he is. Mid table manager, mid table subs, mid table result. Rushed James back from injury and now we are paying the price. Sick of this btec shit manager and the tools who defend him on this sub.",,I needed this. Cheers.,"The other day, Azpi got there first and won the ball cleanly, then a Arsenal player kicked Azpi in the foot and injured himself and Arsenal got the foul, which ended our one progressive attacking moment in the game and Azpi got a yellow.

That was all I could think about as Gallagher showed the ref his fucked up stabbed leg, whilst the ref waved him away and the commentators desperately tried to assure me that I am insane for thinking otherwise.",Or offensively. He's got absolutely zero intelligence on the ball. Just because he can glide past a player or 2 doesn't mean shit if he does t do anything good afterwards.,He got the corner and drew about 3 United players to him when he got the ball. All subs played well,"I hate him because of his book. 
And how his father or family members through tantrums at Chelsea, the manager. 
Surely there must be a little problem with his work rate in training sessions? 

He showed he can play good football if he works hard and stops complaining all the time not only he will start getting more minutes fans will start cheering him more.",,,"All service from the wings, nothing from midfield or over the top.  Not that this is new from this team, but like the Chilwell goal against WHU, we need to be willing to attempt to create offense different ways and take some risk.  Also, can’t dribble the ball into the goal every time, have to be bold enough to shoot.",,Him and Roberto Carlos.,,"I liked what I saw as well, I saw things that we lacked a lot such as speed, daring passes, overlapping as well, whether this was just a new manager bounce of a bit of Potter's magic I don't know but it's promising.

The result obviously wasn't ideal, but we have a managers for less than one week, it's not gonna be perfect. Potter will find the perfect formation, Fofana and Koulibaly will obviously start and Ziyech hopefully not.",,,,"Everyone needs to have a look at themselves cause this is fucking dire. How have we gone backwards? Rudiger, Werner and Lukaku exiting plays no part in us being this shit this early. Important few days in the transfer market. Lord have mercy","Kai plays deeper 1 time undr tuchel for 20 minutes and literally scores off a late attacking run into the box, something not one other midfielder has done in the entirety of tuchels reign. 

Long term i think lamps had it right just never got the DM he needed to work, the future of our midfield (if we can get him) should be rice mount kai",,The man can do it all. The debate people make around Reece and other English fullbacks is hysterical. He’s already the best RB I’ve seen play for the club for 20+ years,"All of the following can be true: we deserved to win, Anthony Taylor is a shit ref, Mike dean can’t look at a review monitor properly, we missed too many chances, we need a better striker. I still can’t believe spurs are celebrating like they won when both of their goals should have been disallowed. They will be lucky to finish top 7 with that showing today.",Buy more good enough central midfielders instead of another defender or wingback or winger.
489,"The announcing team for the US broadcast was atrociously biased for Tottenham and barely hiding it.  

Not only were they were repeatedly incredulous about the red card being rescinded (something a VAR review got right for once), they gleefully discussed how Tottenham fans would be mocking Chelsea fans, and believed the Mount yellow was justified while the off the ground lunge through a Chelsea player was a good no call.  

Never before been so annoyed an announcing crew.","Potter's the GOAT, plastic.

Update: see how sarcasm doesn't translate well.",This,Same. I've defended him every time but I can't defend this. Absolute disgrace of a performance and an abysmal result.,Enzo being last man is on GP and no one else. It’s 101 shit.,Nice,Guess I missed the /s,You can't support a motorway,"![gif](giphy|Gq5o6xHv9REl2)

Reece coming back into the side","get your head out of your ass, they will get better. majority of them are nowhere even near their prime. spouting negativity just makes you a prick","Its like he's in quicksand. Runs slowly, passes slowly, does everything slowly.",That 11 prob finishes 4th tbh,,"Thanks, I got too worked up…",Its so weird how he'll make runs and challanges but have zero confidence in passing forward,"United are improving, Spurs are shit but they have a manger who can get it over the line even when playing badly, Arsenal are doing really good. They're above us in the battle. January is pivotal for us.",I knew it would happen as well. Kane has set the marker.,"Glad someone's agreeing with me, at least. Annoying thing is that he obviously has talent. Goes without saying, I'll never forget the UCL final winner, and besides that, he's shown other glimpses. That finish against Newcastle was actually beautiful. He just annoys me though, maybe it's a mentality thing, just doesn't seem fully into it right now.


Kepa has revived his career under Potter, I was really hoping Kai would try to do the same, but so far it really seems unlikely",,,Just gonna put on the Citeh game to remind myself of what good football actually looks like,,James is the best right back in the world imo,,"I’ll add to this that both the RLC and Gallagher subs seemed destined to disappoint as neither tend to thrive against low blocks. We immediately lost a runner into the box with Havertz and penetrative dribbles at the back line  with Kova when these two came on. They both couldn’t find the right spaces and mostly seemed to just crowd Ziyech’s space, though no excuse to his poor performance.",,,,Mid table team,"Haha I missed the game and when I saw puli started, first to be subbed off, and two goals after I thought I would come here seeing everyone shitting on him. Then I didn’t see anything and was like maybe he played well.",,"Every time he touched the ball, I was like god damn he is so good",I hope this shit happens to Liverpool then see how fucking furious Sky sports pundits will be. Pathetic they immediately waved that shit off as a good spectacle for the neutrals.,"Chalobah/ ampadu, mount/havertz move down, kovacic hopefully back, we sign a proper dm. Plenty of ways this can go but instead we’re gonna blow 80 mil on another center back"
490,#PotterOut it’s full time he’s not top team qualified,"OH ROMAN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT’S WORTH?","You get confidence from playing well and battering a bad team, not being awful and squeaking out a goal from a set piece. Nothing has changed with this result.",If not we’re not a serious club,But we lost,Bold of u to assume,For real. What could have been tho. Miss Tommy  🥲,I thought Gallagher was quality today. He’s the hardest working player on the pitch every match.,"From all the games Potter has managed so far, I don't know how you can pin this one on him.",But the front three keep pointing to each other /s,Says yes to the owners,"I think we’d still have the same issue. Top teams have their best players playing 70/80% of the season. Pulisic has managed three in a row and he’s out again. James and chilwell won’t make anywhere near a full season. Its not about needing better rotation, we need a less injury prone starting 11",,"Potter needs to get at least 3 years to get his players in and truly build something.  I don't want to hear anything about Potter needing to be fired after two losses, especially from those fans here that were screaming for Tuchel to be sacked.",My god just see how jorginho was progressing the ball in the second half vs the first,"It’s excruciating how much Potter reminds me of Kevin Stefanski, the coach of my American football team, the Cleveland Browns. Both of them think they’re the smartest guy in the room and like the smell of their own farts.","It's a staple of this fixture tbh. I said the same to another guy, it's a logical gates fixture (computer science reference), it's always 0 0, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1",What do you mean fuck no. That was 100% a pen at the end.,,,"We got a bit better cohesive passing with jorginho in the midfield.

Mount didnt really work in midfield and we got overrun.

I rather start j5 and kova this weekend.

Maybe its time to realise that more midfielders meen more players taking lateral runs.",,"Yeah, I don’t think there’s much between them solely based on talent",,"To be fair he was wide open. They didn’t even mark him, a gamble that seemed to pay off.",,,,Relegation battle incoming by then.,He's never going to be fairly rated here.  It's either you love him or you hate him.  There's literally no in between.,,Nah he ain’t but he sure is amongst the best.,Its not a good look if a game like this is decided by two refereeing decisions. Not a good look at all. It seems like the premier league is all about which decisions you’re lucky to get. The football is secondary to that,Thank you!
491,"Part of me wants potter gone, part of me wants the players to figure it out. They got Tuchel sacked and now they’re gonna get potter sacked. When does it end",THE FUCKING CHAMPIONS LEAGUEEE,No doubt the boos at half time really had them down. Glad they came through though. I dont want us to be relegated. Still potter out though,Not a chance,From what I saw (I didn't get to catch much of the game) but it just looked like we couldn't finish/follow through any of our shots on goal,Lol,I had low expectations but didn't expect to lose..,He was getting fouled left and right,"2 wins, 1 draw and 8 loss. Potter is imbecile.",You're lacking in a way a leader or a player that can make the difference. At least that's what it looks like to me (City Fan). Hope you can come back from this phase. Although now that Arsenal and United are back to being good teams we do need someone to make fun of,Emotional intelligence lolllll,"Pessimistic when the same has happened for 3 plus season. Sure some might eventually get better but how long does everyone want to wait for that. I still thing its worth the gamble on keeping 2/3 of them. I said at the start of the season that james and chilwell would be out at some point and was called negative then, its just realistic.",,"Boehly has said Tuchel didn’t really see the same vision as the board or whatever and that’s that. Just sacking him Early in the season after splashing money on players he wanted is so stupid. Potter can maybe make some better decisions in the starters but we can’t really blame him. He’s going to be here a while, I just hope the scouting team can get the right profiles because we can build with these useless and spineless players.",Jorginho's roles entire purpose is to receive the ball and retain possession.,Even yourself!,When we started bombimg it up field w no regard as to where it went I knew something was coming,[deleted],,,Yikes. Nothing more needs to be said. The footy we have played since we got knocked out of CL last year is not worthy of European football on any level.,,"I'm nearly 30. Been watching football since the early 2000s. Cole was a baller but was not as good offensively as Reece James. Defensively you'd say Cole was better but you don't see James put a foot wrong defensively either.

I feel like people don't realise how bad our squad have been the last few years player wise to the point our right back/RWB is our only consistently effective chance creator, but equally is so good defensively we have to play him at centre back too. 

Not even trying to hype James up, guy is straight up legit.

Like our season straight up derailed last year when he got injured, then picked up again when he came back from injury.",,They were giving the right side to us.,,,,"Honestly if RLC didn't go off injured we definitely should've gone with him and Kova

Fuck me we need a real CDM NOW",No clue. Only 1 clean sheet and that was against Everton,,Idk all the right backs in the world but by far our best player,Let’s be real that shit was an unbelievable spectacle.

|-|-|-|-|",Gallagher is always a step behind it seems,Yeah Potter tactics were on point today............NOT. can't have a donkey train race horses,"Indeed, feels a bit surreal.. kind of like a horrible nightmare. If Im honest I haven’t enjoyed watching us for some time. Two decades watching Chelsea and this is by some way the lowest point, especially knowing there is no quick fix","Lick the owners better. That's what matter, you aren't goid manager or true fan if you can't do that.",That is fucking tragic ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),,"I think Tuchel reached the end of what he could do with these players, and it was worth seeing what another manager could do.

The answer is a big fat “nothing,” and at least now we know: this squad isn’t good enough right now. We’re going to have to blow it up and start over—this time with an actual GM.","I will add, I wouldn't be surprised if this Nkunku deal fell apart too. Why would he join us when we are such a mess? How do we attract the best when our manager isn't a big draw? I'm saying that and I am backing Potter for 2 seasons to show us what he can bring. But it is a fact if we're looking like this and we have a pretty unknown manager compared to what we've had in the past, what huge players will want to come join?","Forget about confusion everyone, players have their comfort positions and that is important",This is just the same no matter what time of the game and it’s not just the younger players. We go in front and then just invite teams to play football and let them try score as many as they want.,couldnt have been worse than kai,,,![gif](giphy|R9cQo06nQBpRe),,"we haven't looked smooth for a while. there were points in the first half where we looked good but we generally just were playing in front of Palace, we have issues getting behind opponents for a multitude of reasons, but since that's Aubameyang's and Sterling's strengths you would think we would get better at it but our supply lines are so bad they can never get behind teams properly.",,"My god, he can't even cross the ball with his right

He had all the space to whip it in but still tried to get it on his left and conceded a goal kick",,,,"Jorginho is a training cone defensively, slow in all aspects, has no left foot, doesn't pick out forward runs like he used to. I think he's out there cos we just don't have anyone better right now. I hate shitting on our players but I've really had enough. This isn't to say it's all on him, at all, I reckon we could realistically need to replace nearly half the starting 11 to be a title contender. Hell, even to secure top 4 probably. Dark days man",Jorginho lost possession in our third yet again *almost leading to an opposition goal. Bailed out by VAR this time but damn it's happening way too often.,,Not for long,"Well you have Tim fucking Howard, magically agrees with the refs and says Romero wasn't violent conduct. Hes a joke, dishonesty for the sake of it","> So far for Chelsea he’s played as an 8

He only played like half a dozen matches there under Lampard and he actually looked pretty good there (not surprising given it was similar to how he played at Leverkusen), but we quickly abandoned that because Kante didn't have the discipline to play as the lone DM in a single pivot and we kept conceding goals. 

It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and then being baffled over why it's not working. The issue isn't knowing what system would get the most of him. He's a modern 8/10 hybrid that should be playing in a midfield trio where he can progress the ball forward and chip in the odd goal with late runs into the box. Problem is that we can't play that way as long as we're depending on Jorginho and Silva. It's not just him suffering for it either, Mount would be much better as an 8 too but same story again with us lacking the type of DM to make that work. 

Let me put it this way: If he was at Man City right now playing under Pep, there'd be no debate over if he's worth 80 million or not."
493,"I’m now at the acceptance part of grief. I am completely nonplussed about the club and what’s going on. Tuned in twenty minutes late to the match because I honestly couldn’t be arsed watching it, first time in thirty plus years. 

Now I’m at the end of the match I’m not surprised, there’s absolutely nothing there and zero signs of improvement. However, with that said I’d just give Potter the next run of fixtures. Leeds, Leicester, Everton and Villa. We should, under normal circumstances, be winning those. Qualifying for Europe is basically gone so let’s give him those matches and leave it in doubt as to whether he’s fit for the job or not.",Uncanny,"For now, yes!",And bring in who?,He didn't though did he,😂😭,"Tuchel ball was some of the best football I have seen Chelsea playing.  Passion, coordinated press, using every area of the field stretching opponents to oblivion.

This is fucking wank.  Boring, its clueless and its tactically inept.",Gallagher is a roaming midfielder that we shackle while we recycle possession endlessly. He always looks better once the game opens up,The starting 11 was a no-no to start.,"Losing to city isn’t a bad thing in isolation. If we lost 1-0 but played well like on Thursday we shrug it off with a “meh we go again”

Being embarrassed because our players don’t give a fuck is what makes this result a shameful one. Hartlepool United would’ve beaten us today. Players just don’t give a fuck and that’s what we should be embarrassed about",Grows a beard,"I don’t disagree, he definitely needs to hit the gym, but plenty of smaller players make it this league with skill, intelligence, and tenacity.",,"Potter needs to back Potter as well. Have a little bravery on your selection. That lineup was nothing more than lets not embarras ourself type of lineup. 

Zakaria put motm performance and doesn’t even get a minute.

Even once he gets a big pay jump he should be at the upper end of the middle of the pack for wages despite being our best player. It's just how it has to be for youth players or else when it comes to their next pay increase you potentially get priced out of giving them a contract extension.

We should at least have some organization and more control on those errors. Our players look like they don't know what's going on or even where to find their teammates.

Potter can be better than Pep, I don't know, but until now he has been making mistakes that are on him and he made them multiple times so I haven't seen anything worth of replacing Tuchel in him.

Kepa tried his best, he is a goalkeeper not a fucking magician. No blame can be placed on goalkeeper.","Yeah I like the guy but he just has not lived up to expectations, he’s simply a luxury player someone that will look class when he’s got world class players around him ala his Germany performances.

Focus on a clean sheet 1st and foremost. 0-0 sucks but there has to be a refocus on defense and especially set pieces. The set piece defense this year has been atrocious and it almost like teams have “figured us out”. So there needs to be some self analysis with that.

Then a midfielder needs to be purchased. I think this game is gonna make Boehly and Tuchel over spend on FDJ to see if they can get him here. Failing that, I think it moves to a 3-5-2 with Mount and Gallagher infront of Kova. Broja and Sterling as the top two kinda on islands.

We’ll see, but this team needs some dogs. Reece is a dog, Cuca is a dog. Havertz imagines himself as one, but he does so little on the ball his antics don’t really matter. Kova is a dog too, hope he’s healthy enough to start playing each game, cause Jorginho is absolutely done. At this point, Ampadu would be a much bigger upgrade over J",Yes that’s me!

However, with regards to Zakaria and Potter, we surely have to trust Potter's judgement given a) how much more he knows about football than we & b) how much he saw him in training.  Didn't Zakaria come out with some comment that he hadn't been doing that well in training?

With regards to Hall, I'm not really convinced by your system argument.  He was super impressive even last season when he played, but we didn't see any more of him.  I don't see why he couldn't have played in 3-4-3?

Not only that but he also took the same freekick twice and put the ball out of play countless times. I'm already getting fucked by my energy bills, now this cunt's fucking everything else up.

Also what the fuck is Mount doing? Should have never been on the pitch, he needs a long rest or a happy ending in Soho. 

No clue what the front three were doing, at any stage of the game. As soon as a prolific attacker signs they hang up their shooting boots and put on their dancing ones.

No joke!,Why are you comparing us to teams in the other half of the table?,"I'm not sure who else we could have had as the last man, maybe pair Enzo and Mudryk back there or go with Reece. Everyone else was either taking the set-piece, or had value in/around the box.

In the end, it was just an effective break from Dortmund.",its cliche because it's usually true. the real question is whether we gel in time to get back into the top 4.,"Aye, developing us into a mid-table club.

He's extremely, *extremely* lucky. Marsch just got the sack for a similar run.",LMFAO,"Explain the joke to me. Clearly I’m too stupid and it’s too clever a joke. I’m ready.

Edit: and if the punchline to this joke is that Tuchel wouldn’t have left if Todd got the number of players right, it’s not a good joke.",Weird that you question players motivation then mention two of the very few players who've actively shown some fight this year.,Bend over well,Lmao exactly,,Are you sure about that?,"Hard to point to even a single player who is playing near their best right now. Kepa was, that's about it.","RLC is shit in every aspect of being a player. most of the team is tbh, but thiago silva",Yeah but his technique was perfect. Even if the goalie is taller so many reach with bottom hand and just don’t even get close. Look at de bruyne goal against man city today to see what I’m talking about,"I'm guessing this is mainly because of that chance where a pass to mount was a clear goal, but I think he did try to pass it, but was on weird place with his feets so he had to drag it longer. I was pissed he was took off, he was very hungry for a goal, that chance was created all by himself.",,,The only good thing is that Fofana looked really good. K2 is getting there. I really want to see a back 4 with chillwell k2 fofana reese and our new CDM,,"Or because mount was shit, havertz was mostly invisible, sterling wasn't great.... But that couldn't possibly be it, right?",,I have to agree. It was much better attacking football. They need time to change mindset I think.,,,,The midfield is the biggest problem,Mount will still be rated higher in the post match survey lmao,,"Well his shit show to waste time are always epic. He must be an A grade troll, always find ways to antagonise opponents.",Always rated Romero,"It's not ""obvious"" mistakes with Kepa, it's that he doesn't save saveable shots."

Potter will get us playing free flowing football eventually. 🌚🌚",even in the way of himself scoring🤣 but nah looked fantastic,Last week was Spurs.,Potter’s tactics today were moronic. Bordering on sabotage.,"Enzo being last one back was the right call, Adeyemi is literally one of the fastest players in the world.","""Sack the squad""",Not blaming Tuchel. He made the best out of shit situation but football was dire nearing the end. We have better players now that Potter needs to get the best out of.,"I'm all for just taking an impromptu trip to Dubai again next week and just ""forgetting"" to bring Auba back.",🤨,We've had core players that have been here for so many managers and so many matches where they had zero interest. Why do you think anything will change under another manager?,The squad was this bad under Tuchel and is this bad under Potter. You can’t rebuild an entire squad in one transfer window.,They overloaded the shit out of him and he was left without help most of the time,,Exactly this squad is overrated af and we’re far too reliant on RJ and Kante to play well,"Exactly. One could argue were without our top 2-4 players. Take those off any team and they’ll struggle. Not using it as an excuse for poor play from a lot of the team, but it’s a fact, this team is hurting. 
I guess one could question the depth.. if they had brought in another rwb for Reece, he may not have been injured, if he got more rest of played RCB more often, but every time I suggested that, I was yelled at lol",Good news is the World Cup will be a hard reset for everyone,"I got down voted by 20 for stating this fact, it's so funny watching people kick and scream when their hero of the week gets critisised","In fairness, he's a 9... Diego had terrible final passing as well",,,"* losing two forwards bought for$150m+ for peanuts 
*Not re-signing Rudiger
* not trying for Dembele on literally a free transfer *delaying kounde then losing him

* Believing this midfield was good enough to compete and not going all out for de jong/ tielemans other targets
* Believing an old auba who flourished in a different league with far better forwards/mids helping solve the goals issue


Feel free to tell me what else I missed",,"Pretty much this. 

Bit like how Hazard is easily the best player to have played for us(Joe Cole even said he was the best player he played alongside, when he played at Lille, said he was more talented than Lampard/Drogba/Robben etc which says a lot)",,That’s very typical of having a new coach though. You literally always see it with every team.,,,,We press,"I for one think Havertz has been one of our worst players this season and I think Tuchel should have benched him 2 games ago. Super great to see him come off the bench and give this reaction though. I’ll be honest, I hated when Timo scored sometimes because then it would mean he would get 5 straight starts after, hurting our chances of winning those games. Havertz though can absolutely come good if he can show more consistency as a threat",,Havertz fanboys are embarrassing. Good off the ball movement is simply not enough for a forward.,Hahahaha,"And Lukaku tapped it in. 

I admit they’ve played 1 game and I am obviously overreacting but we desperately need goals no matter how from our attackers and we cannot be a UCL club if our attackers dont score."
504,If that isn't potter gone we're genuinely going to end up in a relegation battle and perhaps the only thing saving us from already being there is tuchels start.,I was baffled when I saw how many players wanted us to offload him this summer. He is a proven world-class defender.,Have no idea what he was thinking with his subs. Such strange decisions.,"Todda did something which he shouldnt have done to begin with i.e. fire Tuchel. I just wish he had backed Tuchel the way he has backed Potter with the signings. You hire a midtable manager, you get midtable performance and today was a shambolic League One level performance.",">I don’t blame Kai for being a bad striker, but he is one and it hurts us so much

I will add that I will blame Potter for playing Kai as a striker instead of playing a strikerless formation/tactics. It pains to see have Kai constantly run to the end of through balls and run with it",Well we played how many new players today?  Lol they do,"Exacly lmao, the cope here is incredibile. Look at what Tuchel has implemented only days after he was  appointed as a comparison.","Missed the game today, but maybe the opposition has just figured him out, and he needs to make some adjustments?","I hear ya, but you don’t just hand the keys over to rebuild a Ferrari to a guy who’s only worked on Nissans.","Look if we can sort out the squad, get into form, then Potter reaches his ceiling (4th-3rd). Then we part ways and go up",right??,[removed],,When you remove our academy players. From the squad our transfer record has been utterly abysmal. I'm glad marina and her band are gone.,I’d love that. We’d finally see some link up play moving forward. Broja would have a player to learn from. Goals would be scored.,"Wishful thinking but I wonder if the World Cup might actually save us this year. 

Multiple key players out who can recuperate and many others likely not going. 

Sterling to turn into England Raheem and come back in top form. 

Hopefully other teams have the opposite problem and half their squad gets wrecked by lethargy.","I agree with this.

Broja had instant impact. Pulisic was getting in their faces. I hope to see more of them going forward but we need more from Sterling and Auba",He would have had an assist if havertz could anticipate for once,,,"We have had the same midfield for a handful of seasons now. All of our results in those seasons have had the same frustrations. Every other position on the field has turned over. There is no organization in the attack, because there is no midfield to support it. We have no creative player. We have no incisive passer. We have midfielders who dribble into cul-de-sacs and play the safe pass because they don't have the skill set to put people through on goal. When they do, our attackers aren't putting it in the net. Cyclical problems. We need 3 new midfielders badly, a new 6, and an 8 and a 10 who can unlock defenses.",,Pump the brakes. Reece has spent much of his senior career playing in Tuchel's back 3/5 which is a formation that lets fullbacks absolutely shine. Victor Moses looked world class in a similar setup.,,this. an aberration. not sure if it's just the new manager bounce or Potter's tactics specifically. i hope he can keep this squad inspired. we actually finished the game as if we believed we were supposed to win.,,,,Spent another 100m for random hype unproven  youngster,100% agree on Broja and Havertz. I think they could be deadly if given a run of games together.,,"He would've been 1v1 if Sterling had put a bit better touch on the ball, but I was genuinely impressed with Sterling's hold up play and making the turn and getting the pass off.  It's sometimes a game of inches.",They’re not corrupt. It would require brains to be corrupt. They’re just incompetent and biased.,"We don't create much BECAUSE of these attackers. Instead of dropping back to pick up the ball they just sit around. Missing chances would be perfectly fine if they were active in the build up and contributing to chance creation, but instead they think they're entitle to just wait for balls into space as if they're some master goalscorers.

Why do you there's no option central?"
505,Good thing I still have Wrexham to support and they didn’t disappoint.,"Lool valid, I’d forgotten that had even happened 💀

Let’s call it a 9.9/10.",3 points is what mattered today. For Potter's confidence and Players confidence.,"Is this the same Potter who was criticized for re-injuries because he was playing players too soon? So if I'm clear, he should rest players but also not rest players. Got it. Yup, all his fault. /s

Honestly if there's a right time to experiment with tactics, it's during a cursed season that's already lost. I'm not saying Potter is a good tactician, I don't know the answer to that.","Ziyesh created a lot, what are you on about?",Gallagher is better than mount this season atleast,"Cross and inshallah, and long ball to our twiglet no. 9

How do we run out of ideas by minute 30 of every game, its so embarrasing man.

Change the tactics or something, yank a player, fucking cause a scene, dropkick a fan.  I dont give a fuck.  This usless wet flannel is sucking me dry of my joy for the game.",He’s been figured out and hasn’t improved. Stagnated is word your looking for to describe Mount,He looks like a deer in the headlights in the dugout. The man has to tell the media that he can get mad because he’s so lifeless on the pitch,Set up to fail by Todd. Should have given Tuchel the year and then brought in Potter. It's on Todd but unfortunately Potter is the new face of the regime and will get the blame.,I will say at least Cucu gave a shit out there and was trying some different things. Probably not good enough for us tho,Without a doubt lol either you’re delusional or hyperbolic,,"Our problems run deep. The state of this squad isn’t to be blamed on Tuchel or Potter or Boehly. We brought in some good players this year but haven’t had a proper transfer window in what feels like ages. We’ve absolutely pissed money under Marina’s watch on awful, awful players.  Signing players for insane sums like Lukaku, Kai, Kepa, Pulisic, Werner, Morata, etc have ms been an absolute disaster. People like to complain about Boehly yet have not once thought about the genuine 1/10 recruitment that Roman & co were responsible for since 2016.  Change was 100% needed.

Who was the last genuine world class player we bought?  Kante for 32m in 2015?  Kovacic in 2019 or whatever?How do we follow up that brilliant piece of business with nearly a decade of repeated, miserable failures?  Roman/Marina invested nearly half a billion of player transfer and nearly off them have been AWFUL. The best of all of them was signing 35 y/o Thiago Silva on a FREE TRANSFER.  Our squad management has been an outrage for nearly a decade!","I wonder why they sold him suddenly after refusing for years..

They saw the writing on the wall","Agreed, with all the injuries we’ve had and the clearly below average players being forced to play Potters done well so far. So bored of seeing fans obsess over the ex-manager, get over it, he’s gone.","Yes, i really dont get this, why so late when the game was more stale than a month old moldy bread, nothing was happening. 

I can get it if there were plenty of chances created by the starters, but nope. Pulisic, i dont know man, he needs starts.",Also needs to learn he has two feet.,,,Maybe we'll win the Europa League this season 🤣,,"Ashley Cole and Reece James aren't even in the same conversation my friend. Ashley Cole was a bonafide elite level player, not only that but he also played in an era where he competed against some of the most skilful wingers the game has seen. Naturally, Reece James can't control who he plays against but the quality of players he faces haven't been as skilful generally speaking. 

Reece James is still early in his career so he has time to improve across the board, but as of right now it's impossible to look beyond Ashley Cole for not only his overall quality but his consistency to produce week in, week out at a the highest level.",,It’s easier to do so against poor opposition,,,,"I’m mad, not sad.","dude he punted his chest, that last angle showed it. I think it was the right call",,Hopefully he magically starts banging goals in and becomes our new Diego costa lite,RLC was electric today. If he can keep playing like that he'll make a massive difference with his versatility,"Who claimed capable ? His finishing is worse than James, chillwell and Alonso. He is not great at anything.

How about werner and lukaku ? Did tuchel's system made them miss easy chances too ?"
506,All this Potter hate is redirecting our focus from how god awful everyone on this team has played the ENTIRE SEASON!!!!,We don’t talk about that 🤝,You know you sometimes have to grind results. It happens quite often. But if you wanna play the narrative game. Tuchel couldn’t fix it.  Potter clearly can’t fix it.  So it tells me it’s a squad issue.,Ole looks like Alex Ferguson compared to Potter. Ole finished 2nd and 3rd with some mid Man U squads,"To be honest I thought other than being a bit card happy, the ref was pretty good

Edit: perhaps better to say would be I thought the ref was fair. Obviously getting the cards out too early isn’t the hallmark of a good performance but I thought he was consistent and got pretty much everything right","Why do we take such weird pleasure in shitting on our own players? We seem to especially love hating the ones who actually show the most commitment and passion, it's truly baffling to me. Gallagher, Ziyech and Mount were the only players to create a clear cut chance today and we still continue to shit on them.",Mans didn't even rock that new manager bounce. Went back to shit after 2 or 3 games,He did one of those half turns towards the end of the first half and took the ball brilliantly and the move broke down with Hall just after.,"This is not the same team that won the Champions League. Just 4/11 of the starters from today started in that final.

The majority of these players are clearly not good enough, this is down to abhorrent recruitment and poor decision-making with outgoing players.

Potter needs to bring some stable results, he isn't perfect at all, but it is impossible to implement a pattern of play when a) he is constantly barred with injuries and b) the players simply do not try.","Seeing van dijks levels nowadays after his acl injury depresses me

Chilwell and broja need to recover from that",No. Tuchel died because he had us play like shit WITH a healthy Reece James and squad. Is your memory that bad?,"They will het better next season, don't worry   /copium",,The only explanation of the continual insanity that I can think of is that it’s written into their contracts about playing or starting time,This is boehly’s fault not potter’s but he isn’t helping his case,The Coach was never the issue,Potter subbed Kovacic on at the 36th minute and it definitely was a positive improvement.,Weird way to say pulisic,,,"Fuck that was embarrassing, how in the hell is their no one who can play a defence splitting pass on our team or who is willing to take long shots? 

This was just bad, Ziyech made their left back look like prime Ashley Cole. Tuchel has to really start working his magic now because this is a terrible look",,"I dont think any of those guys you mentioned are penalized for not being on all time teams. They are all recognized as world class and among the best at their positions.  

Reece has a chance to reach Ashley Cole status but you can’t be serious comparing them right now. Ashley Cole bossed games at left back for a long fucking time and was a key part in many of our trophies. I’m not saying Reece isn’t a big game player but sample size is still too small. He also seems to be more injury prone so far in his career which would prevent him from reaching Cole’s status as best fullback to ever put on the chelsea jersey",,"we did play better. IMO the goal salzburg made its because personal error of our player and lost concentration.

its bitter to say, but we played much better than last game vs dinamo zagreb.",,,,Exactly what the fuck will Auba do with this.. hell score 6 goals total,"I agree with all of this!  Glad to see Puli play better, still on the fringe of starting regularly for me. Broja deserves a go, and good to see Kai bounce back.  Mendy- yikes.",,No. Rudiger is actually good,"Fucking A. I'm always pulling for Rubey, lover his play today.",So it's the system that makes them miss easy chances ? Not even speaking about not being able to create anything 1v1
507,At this point I hope our boys are ready for an intense relegation battle in the next few months with the likes of Southampton,"defense wise, we can do it if back 3, IF the wingbacks stay healthy (a must) AND kai wont put up games like this bc hes just not a 9.

but yah maybe at best we can salvage some europa","Ye watched the end as well, players were so hungry for a win","Fuck, at least Ole had his moments. Potter has totally neutered this squad; the only goals we get are through a mountain of struggle by the skin of our teeth. We don't even get the once in a blue moon amazing performance.",Ziyech has to be the most frustrating player in the squad. Every once in a while he does something incredible and other times he looks like a lost dog. No consistency from him,barrier shield,Manager bounce in UCL. We've been consistently shit in PL,Which signings are Vivells and which are Winstanleys? Or does Vivell have the final say?,"I agree we should absolutely leave with 3 points each from Forest and Fulham, mistakes costs us goals and we’re incapable to score","100% couldn’t agree more. I was trying to think of the right word to describe this bunch of misfits and think ‘Frankenstein squad’ is pretty accurate lol

So many failed transfers in the last handful of years trying to paper over cracks. No long term plan in terms of squad building. Or at least not by anyone professional (or sporting director).

If it wasn’t for Hazard and Kante and now to a lesser extent Reece over the last couple of years, then this collapse could have happened sooner",How is Jorginho not making that list? He was dreadful today. A complete non presence and did nothing to help us retain possession or develop play. We looked much better then second he came off.,Gotcha thanks for explaining it might have to watch the next game with that in mind,,"this club has made a lot of mistakes recently. hiring Lamparad, firing Tuchel, hiring Potter, overpaying for players, buying AUBA,  getting bought by a guy who doesnt know what he is doing but wants to do it really hard. the list is too long to even type it all. 

it will probably be a lot of pain for a long time but this team probably has a lot of very bad karma to work off given the previous owner, and its very possible things will never get better.","we havent played good out 9f the back since march, even TT said this season that players are not good enough, we have been in shit for since last spring, we are not press resistant anymore evidence, Everton game, Leeds game even Leicester game","yup it's all connected. Way too reliant on Reece + Kanté so we play them as much as possible, and then when they break, we can't find the necessary solutions.","Yeah, the last ten minutes were mad and the draw was a fair result. 

Two average teams with weaknesses up front. Our lack of a killer instinct up front is keeping us from moving up to the next level. Neither team did enough to earn the three points.",Broja is a bit slow to release the ball. Only criticism for an otherwise solid performance,,,"This squad has been so mentally weak for years. We saw it under Sarri, Frank and not Tuchel. At least for sarri we had hazard dragging us into the points. There is nobody in this squad capable of it now.

But this is the chelsea way, the fans turn on the manager instead of the players, we ride a new manager bounce and then we’re right back here in 18 months.",,"I guess it’s a liiiittle close, but idk Ash in his prime was one of the best players I’ve ever seen. He just played in a position that was very unfabulous at the time. People that only saw him closer to the end of his time with us probably remember him more for goal line clearances and being great defensively, but when he was a little younger he was just as good offensively and top tier quick.

Relative to his peers while he was playing, I think he’s the best player we’ve ever had. He was unquestionably the best LB in the world for the better part of a decade, and I don’t think we’ve had anyone else that can claim that",,Classic new manager bump. You see this even if the incoming manager is shite,,,,Broja with that one quick turn basically had the most exciting play I've seen from an attacker in 6 months,"> subpar passing tho

Still got the hockey assist",,"80mil for someone that runs...
Gordon is a great deal then I guess..","Whole team was mostly very good today. Jorginho was good other than the 2 poor blunders (one give away early in the game and fucking around with the ball instead of clearing in the box). Havertz was excellent today other than his missed chance. It's absurd how much better he plays when he has more time as the 9. Sterling and him were interchanging much more often today than last week.


Doesn't really matter how you play in this league anymore though, you'll win or lose points depending on the ref's mood.","It’s the same team but two years older with more injuries to Kante and Kova, as well as Chilwell, who were pivotal to how we played"
508,"The scary thing is we could not score a goal for the rest of the season and I don't think anyone would be surprised. We don't look like we even know how to score.

Potter had accomplished nothing to earn the right to manage this club much less a massive long term contract.

Spending £600M and still having to start Havertz at striker, still having to start Ziyech and depending on RLC is completely unacceptable, ownership has done such a shit job with recruitment.

The fact we still need a defensive midfielder and a striker after spending so much is scary.

I have never been so afraid for the future of this club.","Yeah he was specifically bought for that role but hasn't been able to play there because we failed to get any of Ake/Kimpembe/De Ligt to play LCB. It's so clear to see that he fits that role perfectly, it allows him to come out and attack everything without leaving a hole in defence.

Admittedly his swedish project went very very well, but never won the league there, Swansea never really in the playoff hunt let alone competing for the championship title, Brighton got 41, 41 and 51 points, and were hovering around the relegation zone often in those first 2 seasons. His 6 games for Brighton this year were against some of the poorest teams this year in some of their worst form of their seasons.

He doesn't have the winning pedigree, i think we thought we were buying a manager who was ready to take the next step, but he's gone backwards at a rapid rate of knots.

I'll give it 5 more games, but at the end of those 5 when we've been drummed out of the champions league and likely failed to beat both southampton and leeds and played Tottenham back into form, i'm gonna come back in here and say i told you so","He was having a wank on the pitch already, why sit down for it?","Not heal those players, but get more out of the players we have left. That’s what we want. Because we can’t get less out of them.","If we're being honest, all four goals were down to individual mistakes. Kepa, wtf at the free kick? Havertz, this is football not volleyball. Koulibaly / Jorginho / Kovacic, wtf for the third goal? Koulibaly, great tackle you fucking clown.",Looked a way better organised team than us. The fact that they committed 2 or 3 fouls shouldn't make any difference.,Could day the same about this squad where a good portion of the team won the champions league not too long ago...,,"This is a great group of expensive players, but it’s an awful team. Will take several transfer windows to actually put a balanced team together.","Pep didn’t struggle for long, Klopp started with a worse team and made progress quickly.

Pep and Klopp also had pedigree going into their new roles in that they were fighting for titles in Germany and Spain.

So you’re left with Arteta being the closest example - 3 years for a few months of good form and a lucky cup win. God this is dire.",Lol,"I think this is it. We're not bad defending regularly but as soon as it's crunch time and the opposition are panic hoofing it into the box our players can't compete in the air. Everyone in our team bar Chuk, Broja and Trevor below 6ft.",You want Broja to start aheah of Auba against Man United?,,,Can Cross and Insyaallah keep us out from relegation this season?,,"I agree, I'm throwing shade at them",,Your new LB cost more than triple their entire team cost.,,,,*In 400 or so. Been invisible this season yet he's nailed 100%. Baffling managment.,I feel like the ref just let West Ham rough up RLC.,,"When we get a proper striker and can stop playing him out of position, we will get more out of him. He was good enough today and grew into the game as it went on. Good things to come from maintaining the same starting front three and some of the linkup in the second half proved that it's already starting to pay off","Absolutely. I'm so ready for the rage at this robbery to die down so I can appreciate the good. We looked fantastic today, and that makes it hurt even worse.","I don't know what it is with Chelsea fans and revisionist history with playing time, goals scored, and impact. Here is the information for you to compare between questionable players for Chelsea:

Ziyech in 2021/2022: Started in 14 games subbed in 9. Played a total of 1315 minutes in the PL 2021. Ziyech scored 4 goals and assisted on 3. Ziyech averaged 329 minutes per goal. Ziyech scored 1 time in UCL and assisted twice. Ziyech played 444 minutes in UCL.  
  
Pulisic in 2021/2022: Started in 13 subbed in 9. Played a total of 1285 minutes in the PL 2021. Puli scored 6 goals and assisted on 2. Pulisic averaged 214 minutes per goal. Pulisic scored twice in UCL and assisted once. Pulisic played 368 minutes in UCL.  
  
Werner in 2021/2022: Started in 15 subbed in 6. Played a total of 1285 minutes in the PL in 2021. Scored 4 goals and assisted in one. Werner averaged 321 minutes per goal. Werner scored 4 times in UCL and assisted twice. Averaged 61 minutes between goals. Werner played 245 minutes in UCL.

Lukaku in 2021/2022: Started in 16, subbed in 10. Played a total of 1583 minutes in the PL in 2021. Scored 8 goals and assisted in one. Lukaku averaged 197 minutes between goals. Lukaku scored twice in champions league and assisted once. He played a total of 320 minutes in UCL. 

Werner had a ton of playing time. Lukaku obviously got the most, but Werner had his chance to play. He had the least impact of any player and it isn't close."
512,"So 40 points is magic number to avoid relegation.

We have 15 games left and need 9 points to hit 40.

We have got 6 points in our last 15.

He's still in the WC.,"The solution is to play our least bad players, we wont win or create with more defenders, lets try add one more midfielder",Still is,"Yep, now we’re stuck with a mediocre manager who has no experience with a top tier team. I feel sick.",It wasn't the same crop though. Where's Reece? Where's Chilwell? Where's Rudiger? Where's Kante? Where's a Mendy that isn't shite?,,"Not some .. most of it .. questionable roles for RLC, mount .. doesn’t matter what shape we played because we were just outplayed",Newcastle. havent been in a Chelsea situation with the sanctions all the press about the war and our owners havent been here more than 7 months jesus,"The difference being under tuchel besides those games, we looked comfortable winning games. This has been coming for a few games now under potter, we scraped wins the last 2 PL games",Chilwell was 1 v 3 at the back post,"I totally disagree. Think he played amazing. He was a willing runner and made himself available everywhere. Many passes just missed their mark to him.


The one where he had an easy square to mount for the tap in can be chucked to youth and inexperience. But he did fabulously to make that chance happen. No one else on our team could have created that opportunity in the first place.",,,"Tuchel shouldn't be allowed to build his team, he cant recruit to save his life

He's best at coming in and fixing the mess",,"The cross wasn’t from in the box, it was from exactly where jorginho is supposed to be as a DM. And yes, he is supposed to be there to stop crosses from the top of the box. Literally exactly where he is supposed to be.",,"Sterling pass to Auba in early game, i don't think i've ever seen pass like that for months.",,,,I only saw the 2nd half.. I saw Broja go for one header that's about all... So havertz did less?,"RLC has forgotten how to attack, worse he's forgotten to pass forward.",,"Because it shows he’s not phoning it in. Playing badly sucks, but playing badly and not trying, a la lakaka, is something I cannot abide. 

Is he good enough? No. Do we need a good striker so he can stop failing in that position? Yes. Am I happy he’s at least putting himself about, winning fouls and making it tough for their defenders? Also yes",There was a couple times when he should have played forward in a big transition moment and held the ball too long but otherwise definitely is using his strengths much better and showing effort.,C'mon he's the Stamford fridge surely he's got a bit of Chad in him.  It will be for the best but he needs to keep it humble. Silva is the best example to learn from.
513,I hope Thiago gets to rest and recover for the rest of the season instead of coming back to this mess,"He started poor, but was pretty much fine after that. The offsides were much closer than what was originally thought",Some people can never be happy. Progress has to start somewhere. Hopefully that’s today!,At least the lampard teams were fun to watch with the young guns,Was the best player on the pitch today,"Mount was one of the best corner/free kick takers last year in the league, now we see Sterling and Gallagher take corners. I mean WTF?!?!?!","Absolutely. This season is a write-off and recruitment for next season is going to be much more difficult since we're nowhere near competing for European football, let alone winning anything. Next season is highly likely a write-off as well. a) There's absolutely nothing that would suggest that we're getting in any way, shape or form better, and b) because we still need 1 or 2 players and they aren't coming. 

So yeah, everything is fine. Let's 'weather the storm' and 'trust the process'.",Making this change right now as well 😂,I am a bears fan ffs,Always has been,It’s probably the hiring of Potter that is compounding the sacking.,"We were wingback fc with Reece and Chilly playing out of their goddamn skins.
Without them, we lack quality out wide",,Yeah where were all the brilliant tactical changes he's renowned for?,"That's just reactionary. Players like Mount, James, Chilwell and Silva definitely match those players - and you're not considering *how* shit some of the shit was back then. Nothing will convince me that the team of Kevin Hitchcock and Winston Bogarde was better, man for man, than the current squad.",Today’s performance was 100% on Potter. When you play a back 3 with Pulisic and Sterling as the wingbacks you have to almost expect this kind of performance. While the players definitely didnt play well Potter set us up for failure this game,Yeah this is definitely it. Desperately need Fofana's size,This is sarcasm right?,,,Can someone tell me what the hell is happening,,It’s really just puli because he’s “captain America”. They just want to see him fail even if it hurts Chelsea,,Most consistent Chelsea player.,,,,What did he do? I fucking hate this. So he headed a ball and that makes him good? I swear when this hate boner for Havertz gets him sold and he goes on to be world class at Bayern il blame all the fucking idiots that say shit like this.,RLC is not made for no.6 His best game always as an 8 and wingback. This is on tuchel. RLC just doesn't have the brain to dictate the game.,,"Mount could use a game on the bench, sure. Not sure Broja is fit enough to start, and not sure how I feel about pulisic and sterling as a 2 up top, or who we’d play in a 3. Ziyech/pulisic/sterling? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",He did quite well - aggressive and i love it,I've noticed he sometimes prefers to square up and out muscle the opponent  (looks back over his shoulder first to back in) when he can just play the first time ball.
514,Surely the last straw for majority of our fans?,"I mean he did not have a good overall game. Mistimed a few of his runs which were then offside, a lot of massive touches. He gave effort, but it wasn't a good game.",It was a disgustingly shit performance we had 3 shots on goal vs a relegation team,"Lampard did well he could just never get them to be defensively solid, everything else was fine.


At the moment the entire team looks poor


And lampard made money for the club by introducing tomori and Abraham and then selling them for a nice fee",We need a striker more than a CF,You clearly aren’t watching us get it wide and cross. Sometimes we even try 1-2s which never works!,"The fact he also wanted to keep some of the deadwood too, it would've held us back.","For pool it is a combo of injuries, need a massive midfield overhaul like we do, and pressing and playing with high intensity for years without acquiring proper depth. They are getting older, injured, and burned out",Lol shut up… I say that as a lions fan. Don’t even point to this season you know the truth,Aye it's been bad. Not said any different. Just saying we've had a tough recent run. Hopefully with some easier opposition we can do better. But considering the Forest game I'm not sure. Also we have Liverpool in 2-3 weeks :),I hope this is always remembered. Every single moment of this is Boehly's fault for sacking Tuchel because he wasn't his yes man - threw it away so needlessly.,Tell me who else you bring on?,,Terrible player selection once again.  Potter is turning out to be just as infuriating as Tuchel became running out Sterling and Havertz week in and week out.  It’s the definition of insanity,It’s been consistently getting worse since Conte/Sarri but the last year or so it’s become a cesspool,"I agree, especially because we’ve seen how inferior teams are able to force a win purely because their mentality is strong and the willpower unwavering. As long as we do not fix the issues at the root cause of them, we will continue to be inconsistent.", I'm normally down for a stoppage time bj,He can't pass and get on the end of his passes too.....,,,"Tuchel needs to figure out a way to create quality chances and just say forget it to all his previous ideas and the possession stats.

Teams are beating us not even worrying about anything but letting Chelsea pass themselves into backwards oblivion.

Idk how you get on the plane tonight and think that  only small things need to change or that passing backwards and out to the sides where no one ever seems to get onto the end of a cross or take shots is gunna do shit. You have good enough players to be better than this. Time to come come up with a new idea",,">You’re creating an imaginary person

all your latest comments about the game involves pulisic, mount and havertz and you are saying this",,Idk why this made me laugh.,,,,I really expected him to start today,"I agree on RLC, he’s always a passenger. It seems like he wants everyone else to take the risks while he does everything to play it safe. It’s one of the main reasons we don’t create much this game because he’d always pass it back to the defenders.",,"The disrespect RLC gets on this sub is disgusting, he gets compared to Reece James who is legit world class, RLC has solidly filled in that RWB role better than anyone else has besides Reece",J5 was also class from about the 8th minute up until that retarded shit he pulled in our box,"It is not that everyone sucks, it’s that they all fit different systems and we had a poor recruitment strategy. I don’t get how people don’t see this"
515,Yo that sucked,He didn’t take a step right the first half except for his goal which was served to him on a silver platter.,If Potter stays you might have your 2nd child by the next Chelsea win,We could at least harness the power of friendship back then.,"Shame we have no other options in the UCL, unless we go with Felix or Sterling up top. Far from ideal though, I would keep Felix in his best position.","There's nothing. There's no press, there's holes in midfield.",You dont want him to be in areas of the pitch where he can get targetted and pressed?,We got the advantage I’d imagine because Mudryk got his shot away.,Chelsea will not be relegated. That’s just hyperbole. A 12th placed finish again might be the lower end of likely finishes.,Very nice strawman my dude.,He constructed this squad,So easy to find the mouth breathers these days,,"No it wouldnt, we wouldnt have a defence left if we didnt replace Christensen and Alonso","Idk, but the club fucked up by sacking him and now Potter will probably follow, I think he wasn't a good choice. There's certainly a structural problem in how the club is run and I've watched the players long enough to know they're not gonna get any better anytime soon. I honestly don't know how this can be fixed, but sacking Tuchel was a bad decision.",These people are laughable LOL,Exactly. They let in easy goals against Man U a few weeks ago…..they were still up by 3-4 goals so it didn’t matter,"I said this match, this match he gave the ball away a ridiculous amount. I'm not comparing him to him overall clearly....",,,This club can't operate with the same manager for more than 2 seasons.,,"Everyone on the pitch except for Silva and Reece were subpar, Mount and Havertz were not particularly bad relative to the rest of the team. We don't play good football overall, yet you won't shut up about Pulisic, Havertz and Mount. The place to obsess over your country's player is not a Chelsea fan forum, it's really annoying, you should fuck off and do that in an american soccer page or something",,Generous,,,,Compass is definitely pointing a bit more in the Di Matteo direction.,Pulisic played well? Most threatening player? He barely made an impact and was hooked at 60’…,,Was playing LM first half. Think he got subbed at half time or around there.,He was excellent fuck dumfries we got Rubes,"It doesn't help our forwards because they are garbage. They underperform xG over and over again. I've lost count of how many sitters they have wasted, are you blind in not seeing them?"
516,"I don't think anyone who comes in will change our fortunes, we're essentially playing 4-2-4 which is somehow the most attacking but the least attacking way of play at present",Cause he scored. Had he not scored people would be singling him out.,[deleted],Unfortunately probably over,It's only the first half. We're 2 Stanford Bridge goals better than that team.,Trust the process,That's a fair take. Don't see it being that black and white but to each their own. My energy is still on how lacklustre we still are.,Pitch looked like a middle school.,"WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THESE GARBAGE PLAYERS AND ANYONE HALF DECENT IS INJURED???? 

Clean house now of the lot of them. We can sack another manager, scrape a top 8 finish and then just kick the can down the road a bit further.",I see your point,Tuchel’s performances were just as bad.,"Regardless. Why would go from fighting for titles at City where he has a squad brimming with technical ability and quality and where he repeatedly gets backed with top of the line scouts and DoF, to Chelsea where he's got a squad littered with bums backed up by a haphazard, transitional footballing structure?

Pep wants to spend training sessions reaching a football zen not watching players like Mount or Ziyech fail to control the ball",,"It made no sense at all.

It was predictable, when the board penny pinched Rudigers contract that we'd go and waste a fortune",You think bohly can’t find a WC manager to build stability he want it. He decided to go for sub standard GP. I’ll keep saying this DAVID MF MOYES EVERTON FREAKING TEAM PERFORM & ACHIEVED ALOT THAN GP BRIGHTON EVER DID. YALL GET CARRIED AWAY WITH GP LEAUGE POSITION,"Denial is hitting you hard

This form and play gets us no were for Top 4",Anyone else had enough of 5atb with jorginho? We have zero creativity because the attackers are always isolated,He had more turnovers than good passes today,,,"One of the worst performances I’ve seen in 30 years I reckon. Complete lack of character and identity to this team. Every time I see a starting XI there are more and more doubts about what we’re trying to achieve.

Who would’ve thought that signing players like Sterling and Aubameyang would turn out to be an expensive disaster that only further irritates loyal fans who have hated those players at rival clubs. The sheer lack of imagination with our transfer business is shocking. Shows how disloyal and soulless football has become.

Also, buying Fofana for £70 million when he’s hardly played any games in the top flight (and had a terrible injury already) instead of letting an academy player like Chalobah kick on, or Colwill, or Guehi, or Tomori…

I can only see things getting a whole lot worse before they get better.

Rant over.",,"Reece James got more than double the G+A and triple the assists that Moses had in 17/18 last season, who was in a similar setup and had strikers and wingers who knew how to score goals. Moses was good defensively though but James so clear in every facet of the game outside of creating chances that I don't get why you mentioned his name.",,If I only could give him 0/10….,,,,"When I heard the commentator mention the pitch being shit, i thought it would be a worthy excuse if we played them off the pitch and missed 4 or 5 sitters because of the shoddy pitch. But we didn't. They could've won 4-1 and we barely laid a glove on them in that second half. 

Totally outmuscled and couldn't do anything about it. After the Leeds performance I'd expect more of an answer than one good performance with 10 men against Leicester before going back to being half arsed about it again.",Jorginho has become a truly shocking player,,"RLC was great today with ball carrying and attending his defensive duties. Yet he somehow just always seems to lose all his brain cells when it comes to the final third, somewhat similar to kova. If he can improve on that he will be truly undroppable",He played great but needs to work a bit on his decision making. He sometimes tries to stick to the ball for a bit too long and runs out of options. Needs to be more decisive and quick with it.,"I’m not criticizing them. But outside of some quality runs by each they really do not do that much to support our offense. It’s not their fault, they’re just different players. If we had a quality dm and were starting one of them along with either havertz/mount suddenly our midfield would look competent again"

The season is over already.","""TRUST THE PROCESS""",That's because our manager thinks he is playing fifa,The ones that we need to get rid off sure. Can't tell me that the new signings we've required have already found their level.,"Yeah he should be thanking them, helped Liverpool far more than it hindered them.",He does need time tho obviously at somepoint enough is enough but we saw what he did at Brighton he has tons of injuries if we give him time hopefully he can build a team like Brighton,"If you actually look back objectively it really hasn't been that bad. He was great the entire CL run not just the goal. He was running rings around Real Madrid for god's sake. This season, when everyone has been poor and below their ability he's still our 2nd highest scorer. He has been maddeningly inconsistent but he's also only 23 still, a lot of players don't really find their rhythm week in week out until 25+. Also it's incredibly frustrating to see him play ST, when I think it's clear he's most natural in CM or CAM. If he'd been played there from the beginning I think we'd all be sitting around praising him.",By rightfully sacking him?,He showed more ambition than Ziyech this whole season lol. Those subs were brought in because the team needed fresh legs and players that actually have a fight in them,,"Losing rudiger, christensen, and alonso (too a lesser extent) for free and then having to pay 130m to replace them with worse players was atrocious team management. As poor as alonso is defensively he brings an offensive threat",Why GP? Would RA even consider GP?,"Everyone at the club knew all these things. Exactly what is the alternative? What was the point of picking Potter and sacking Tuchel if we are just gonna sack him? Is it just further shortsightedness from Boehly and Co. If so, our future is properly fucked.","Also was instrumental in killing the press in the second half, you could see how much all the players trust him with the ball. He was good again today. I was all over him during franks era buts he’s been really good and if he keeps that out it’s the save of the season, the view from behind/under the net showed how ridiculous it was to even get a hand to it.","Everything he tried today didn't come off, that's what I'm talking about. Clearly he's not that bad usually but it was a particularly bad game today for him, probably one of his worst in Blue tbh.",,,What the fuck m8,,"Yeah I know Ronaldo generally had trouble with him in the Utd days and I remember his performance vs Messi and Robben in the CL 2012. 12 years at that level too.

We've already seen James play against the likes of Mane/Sterling and some more of the next generation wingers like Vini Jr /Foden/Diaz. I feel like there's an element of nostalgia kicking in but these new wingers are something as well.

James is better going forward, simple eye test and stats shows that, defensively Cole is better and did it for longer but James is no slouch in this regard. Early to be making these conversations I agree but outside of injury, this guy will be talked about like the greats at fullback. Last players I've been this excited about in our squad were Hazard/Kanté, and personally they made a fairly average Chelsea squad win titles.",,"Yeah, and I couldn't even spot pulisic, was he really on the pitch.",,,,"he'll say that because it's true and we should've won in the first 20


We had 3-4 good chances created in the first 20, but no one can finish to save their lives. Then the players stop giving a fuck and concede a stupid goal then play like shit for the rest of the game","Mount didn't do much when he came in to be honest. Gave the ball away.

The “who’s the rat” debates were insanity","We play like a team trying to win but being held back by incapable players.

We look like that because that is what we are.","There was a 20 minute spell where he lost every single duel, and was getting absolutely destroyed every time someone took him on. He was caught ball watching on multiple occasions

Put James in City's team and the way he'd be talked about would be different. 

Kane constantly gets clowned on because he hasn't won a trophy in his career but there's a pretty good argument that he's better than Rooney for club and country, Suarez less so due to his la Liga career but what he did for Liverpool was insane at the time, people really don't understand how good he was, scoring all kinds of goals. 17 yard headers and all, lifting an easily mid table side at the time to title contenders.

In terms of assists James is half way to Cole in a quarter of the seasons cole played in the PL e.g. in terms of his ability on the ball James offensively is better, better passer, better crosser, better touch, better dribbler. Cole I would say is better at last ditch tackles and goal line clearances, anticipations and consistency since he was a key player for 12 seasons and stayed fit.

What pro-Potter PR story are we getting this week?","He chose Pulisic because of his experience, Pulisic has played in these ties before and knows how to game manage, and Potter trusts that he wouldn’t make any stupid mistakes due to inexperience.

We all know what he is capable of and he’s still making saves. As the team continues to get more solid at the back. That will also help. Additionally, if we can get some wins and goals. Some of the pressure he’s facing now might be lifted

When was the last time you felt we were all over an opponent? The game against Tottenham was the first time in a long time that I felt we weren’t going to lose, and we were unlucky to not get a result.

Same can be said for Kai Havertz who is best in transition as well.

If we're going to play a lower block to ensure fast opposition doesn't get a ton of easy transition opportunities against us, then Mount HAS to play deeper as a ball chasing 8 and aid the buildup far earlier than just playing like a traditional 10.

Obviously there were also matches where the team were outplayed or out coached in that period, but let’s not act as if Chelsea are at their strongest right now and over the last couple months and have simply been giving games away for the sake of it.",Lack of confidence probably.,Felix also should have scored. Havertz did well today tbf,"This sub, (like a majority of our fanbase) isn't used to not getting their way. Under Roman, enough fan backlash would get the manager sacked",My mood just changed to really bad also,"We won the CL in 2012 with Boswinga playing RB, we have them right where we want them",,Cucu was average? He was straight up terrible. Worst Chelsea player in recent memory,"You need predictability in your teammates’ movements to confidently play a forward pass or else ur at fault for a counter attacking goal.

There is 0 predictability in our forwards’ movement because they dont know wtf theyre doing. Newcastle are a high pressing team so you have very limited time to actually look around, see whatever ‘unpredictable’ run the forwards are making, and make a quick and accurate pass accordingly. Especially as a CB you have to be very cautious because ur the last line of defence. CBs should be the last players on the pitch we should be ‘expecting’ that from, we have more creative/technical players for that and theyre failing miserably. He put in a pretty solid defensive performance and thats all i can ask from him until Potter knows wtf hes doing",Hahahahahaha,This. Same.,same thing. lockdown puli was looking like a real hazard replacement.,,,"Some people think this is Fifa. We’ve just lost quarter of our team, replaced with as many signings, some of which have barely trained with the squad. Have to give time",,"I understand very much how good Cole was.

Cole was a bit more of a flying fullback/wingback in his early arsenal days, he only really became more known for being that defensive stalwart we know him as when Mourinho bought him. But yeah he also never put a foot wrong and was good going forward.

But when I see James, there's something about him, straight star quality, James basically stands clear from every player in our side at the moment in his quality and consistency, and he's done this for the past 18 months.",,I think with Azpi it's as simple as the new manager wanted the captain on the pitch for his first match in charge. Tuchel did the same thing even though Azpi had been out of the squad.,,,,Pulisic's position in this system IS as a RWB. In this system the attacking forwards play on the inside while the wingbacks play as wingers on the outside. This is the same spot Pulisic would play on another team just with a different name. Not an excuse for his performance at all.,"Great win, but we looked terrible. None of the chances came from Tommy Tactics' tactics. Is the fact that we didn't get a creative midfielder like a Paqueta going to screw us? This season is looking like it will be dreadful. We can't beat any team easily",,Nothing better than a good shithouse when your team is hanging by a thread.,Fucking fuming mate. Both their goals came out of fouls that were not given. That is unacceptable.,"Because our midfield is shocking, and we create exclusively through our wingbacks and attackers."

It affects everyone.,Just like the best striker in the prem went missing tonight. Gtfo plastic,,Bro we have played much worse games this season...,We don’t want huge players. If this is truly a project we want young hungry up and comers.,"Fofana and Koulibaly are injured - taking Pep philosophy, takes a season for players to fully settle in anyway.

This team won’t even make Europa League,,Are you high?,,"Pulisic/Broja or Pulisic/Auba could be interesting, thought Pulisic was quietly decent tonight and Broja just needs to get that first goal to get his confidence going

Havertz needs to find a way to play deeper instead as he is great at creating but poor at getting into those strikers areas",,,,Do you know when kante will be back?,lol for Kepa? Get real,,Sterling was in the right place.  We missed that same opportunity countless times.,"I hope the players are fucking fuming, sometimes shit like this is what you need for a squad. Next game they need to play their fucking hearts out and make a statement.","Tuchel sold the guy who was able to score, Tammy in favour of Kai. Lukaku was very good when chilly and reece were fit and got 0 offensive support after that. He's not gone because of his skill, he's gone because of his shitty attitude.

It's also bad refeereing from Pawson, well he's been known for that so i'm not surprised.",No confidence,That sequence of events was so fucking frustrating to watch.,He had a fully firing Kante. Who in our team is anything near that? He had Tomori who was playing incredibly well. Giroud and Tammy are a better option that what we currently have a CF. He had Rudiger who is a vastly superior player to any of our CB's other than Silva. Even Willian played better than any wingers that we currently have.,"Regragui handed over a very motivated, in form, and happy Hakim to Potter and Potter was still like ""I think 15 minutes will be enough for him"". But in Potter's defense, Ziyech wasn't at this level before he left for the WC so it makes sense he's slowly testing him.","Do people forget we’re undefeated in the CL with Potter? Before the World Cup out performances were night and day. 

We destroyed Milan, this team can play in the CL.",,"This is spot on. Every single match Kai makes multiple dreadful plays. Bad first touches, bad decision making on passing/shooting, overhitting passes. Today he was at fault for the one goal Arsenal scored. Occasionally he'll score a quality header or a wonder strike, but he is so incredibly wasteful and underproductive given the situations he finds himself in. It's infuriating.",Honestly every year I hope we get top 4 to get big players and we sign them and they do nothing. I really don’t mind if we have to make smarter signings now rather than just who’s the big name,Yes it’s better to stick with 3 in back and RLC as DMC,r/chelseafc as usual were calling for Jorginho's head and closing their eyes to RLC's blunders.

At this rate it’s going to happen,,,,"I agree on looking dangerous and taking positives from this performance, but I have to put this lost goal on Potter for not taking the opportunity to shore up the defense after our goal, minute 60 subs. I think Koulibaly or Fofana on the left side for Sterling, Cucu push up to leftwing back, helps protect Silva and Azpi more who are vulnerable to the counter attack, its unlucky for Silva to not get that tackle, but the situation is that only he and Azpi are back which is dangerous for us.",,,,"We don't need Aubameyang and Zaha to defeat the minnows of the League. This is 100% on Tuchel. He needs to fucking wake up. You can't keep doing the same thing over and over again, and then expect different results!",Dude is a club world cup champion and African champion because he is actually that good. The defending was at fault with both the 1st goal and the disallowed goal.,,"Nothing lucky about it, great shot, great positioning",It’s 41 where I live I was already burning up before the game,We rarely create lots of chances. All the big teams miss chances and they still manage to win because they create lots of clear cut chances. Ours misses are too visible because they are very few and we keep losing to rubbish teams. You will also never see assist like those of KdB from our players because of how we play. Almost all our players are struggling in this system. How many players are not playing in their best positions? Reece James is our best player and he is getting wasted at RCB.

My assertion was not that they could not be worn in premier league matches, it was that they should not be debuted in a PL match, but rather in one of the other comps.

A really excellent performance by the team, we played with real fire and really showed our calibre.",Least impact? Are you gonna say that after posting the stats yourself. If you count in UCL stats(which you only posted) both Werner and Pulisic has scored 8 goals and has 3 assists. Werner played 1285+245 while Pulisic played 1285+368.

At least you didn't scream Tuchel out in all caps.

Yes, this is our team without Kante and James. As much flack as the Frenchman gets for injury history and lack of killer pass, he's the only central midfielder we have capable of connecting defense to attack in a way that benefits our attackers. He is severely underrated on the dribble, which forces defenders to commit to him and open up passing lanes for runners through on goal. Jorgi and Kova do not do this to the same effect, because neither of them can threaten the goal from distance. As for James, he is our best two-way player at the moment. His cross-field diagonals from deep were key to beating Liecester's press last week when down to 10 men, and his ability to beat his man on the dribble and provide quality service into the box is world class for a fulback. Not to mention his creativity in possession and capabilities in defense, and his own-goal threat. It's no surprise our balance suffers when missing our most two-way players on the roster.

That said, there's clearly coaching issues going on with putting players in the wrong positions to succeed, and a lack of possession combination patterns in the buildup. There's also a lot of individuals losing their heads and playing hero-ball instead of trusting in the system to score goals, which is creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop.

He wasn't terrible, but I knew I'd come here and see people saying he was excellent.  Same with Broja and Chukwuemeka.  Broja was certainly feisty and I thought he played well overall.

I’ve been a fan of this team for almost 20 years, and the problems you listed in the second paragraph—these are all things that happen when the players give up on the manager. 

So it might be as simple as “Tuchel out”, not because anybody really wants to get rid of the best manager we’ve had in years—but because we might have to. It’s just the way it is. 

Managers are a stubborn bunch. When things start going bad, instead of changing the system, they double down on their own. I hoped Tuchel would be different, but we’re trotting out the same tired shit we have been for the last 6-8 months, and it’s not good enough.

Mooy was finished 3-4 years ago, on his way back to Australia, suddenly he's at Celtic absolutely lighting it up at the moment. 

Go on the celtic reddits and look at the posts about him, they'd kill to keep him (they all know he's going to the premier league some time in the next couple of years though).

-	No striker of any type or quality (Broja injured and probably not good enough to start anyway)
-	No consistent attackers aside from Sterling (brand new so TBD, but historically good), and Mount who has been forced there but has largely been missing the last few months… everyone else either gets injured every few games (CHO, Puli, Ziyech) or go missing for long periods of time (Havertz, or last season add Timo, Lukaku)
-	No defensive midfielder… Kante and Kovacic don’t sit in front of the back 4, Jorginho isn’t athletic enough to play the role, RLC and Gallagher aren’t those types of players either
-	Goalkeepers are either bad with their feet (Mendy) or bad at goalkeeping (Kepa)

552,"I fucking miss Rudigur. We’re so weak. No character after Silva went off we let Spurs bully us. Only Mount showed fight

Don’t even get me started on Potter","The same way you fit Kante, Matic and Fabergas into one. You play 2 and rotate depending on your opposition. Neither Kante or Kovacic are players that will ever play 90 minutes every game, they're made of glass, so rotation is absolutely key to getting the most out of them. 




The last two games should also be a reminder to people that as much as they want to kick the 5 at the back, Tuchel knew what he was doing and it is the answer.","If Fofana didn’t score that header, everyone would be screaming at Potter. Personally, still not convinced",Knowing how Todd likes to spend… would not put it past him at all.,Probably when Prem teams started paying up those fees. Started with Pogba,"Mudyrk did nothing in the first half because all we did was pump the ball to the right and watch ziyech cross with his left. That was our whole attack plan. No dynamic midfield passing. Nothing. Just get it to the right and cross. Again and again. The amount of space between midfield and attack is bonkers. Total lack of connection between the two phases of play. Mudryk wants the ball to feet. Give it to him in space and move around. Noni was able to do that in the second half. But still there was a massive hole between midfield and attack. We need faster movement and faster passes. Idk why we refused to play down the left. Maybe cuz of cucurella? Idk I thought he wasn't too bad but maybe I'm wrong. I feel like the 6 needs to connect to the 8s, who need to connect to the wide players and strikers. But it just seemed like we had no 8s. Only a 6, and then a line of 4-5 just waiting for the ball. No movement. No running. Just waiting. That makes it impossible for the defenders and the 6 to move the ball quickly. You have to be able to pull Fulham out of their defensive shape by creating dynamism. You can't just play down one side with one plan for attack. You gotta mix it up. If 5 crosses from ziyech don't work, force the ball down the left. Create the same triangle down the left. Idk if the players don't have confidence in cucurella or what. But it just seemed like we didn't want to do anything down that left side. Which made mudyrk pointless. And he wasn't good because of that imo. 

Drop mount. I love the guy. But he needs to sit out. Only thing that's concerning is that the other guy that can play there, kai, also is in horrendous form. His touch is so off right now. Flashes of Werner's touch. And he looks slow right now. Lacking in confidence obviously. And mount is similar. Can't execute a pass, can't trap the ball, and is just frustrated. At some point you gotta take him out...I'd sit both of them for the next few games. Play fofana up top, Felix in the 10, mudryk left, madueke right. Gallagher or kova partnering Enzo. And you need to give instructions to Connor to not run around like an idiot. Don't get me wrong, I love his energy and desire. But at times it's like his desire impacts his positioning. He needs to sit along side Enzo. Give room for the 10 to move around the opposition defense, and give his partnering 6 some space to maneuver. Enzo was getting marked out by 2-3 Fulham players in that second half. So Silva and badiashille had no out ball except pumping it up or wide to cucurella and azpi. Or going sideways or backwards. If you have a 6 to partner, the Fulham players have to choose to mark out one 6, which gives the other space and time, or mark both and give more room for the 10 to find space. I just feel like in a 4 back system, you need to play through the middle more. If it's a 5 back with RJ and Chilly, sure you can play more wide because you have easy overloads with plenty back for cover. It's just so frustrating to watch us do the same thing over and over again, and that too so slowly. I think we saw 1 RJ cross the whole game...that's dire. And that's on the system, not Reece. Our midfield needs coaching. Enzo I'm not worried about. But Connor needs to be more disciplined about his role. Can't be running up if you're playing as a 6. You need to stick to your position for build up. It seemed to me as if all mount and Connor were both playing the same position. 

So frustrating because I think they are all good players. Kai, mount, Connor...all of them have the ability. But they just seem like they aren't getting the message. Or maybe the message isn't good enough from the coach.",September with potter means we are out of champions league 2 years in a row.,I think Kai and Gallagher did about as well as you would expect. I expect more from Mount though.,This is where I am at. I dont know what potter brings because he's messing with a broken team. Bunch of players that cant play with each other and just no confidence.

I would’ve kept him on but this idea that we were flying high because we had a few wins in cups is ridiculous and papers over serious issues in personnel and performance. I’m not sure what the solution is (it’s probably “Reece James stays healthy”) but we’ve been legit meh for almost a year.,So do I. I wish he was good enough but he ain't and he isn't improving more from the player he is now. Have to let him go.,Fuck that guy,"I know that our previous managers in Puli's time here have never criticized his training/practice, and while I 100% agree that family/parents getting involved with or pressuring the Club is a bad idea, I know it happens all over.

I'm not a fan of him having a book either to be honest, but I did feel as though Tuchel played favorites, and made lineups and sub decisions based on that, rather than on effort or performance. Tuchel actually mentioned that was something he would/was struggling with, with Puli, since he knew him from Dortmund and wanted to play him in the same/similar manner (super sub) as he did there.

I still standby my initial statement though, that hating any of our players is detrimental. You don't have to buy a jersey, or ""like"" them, but when we start to hate someone on a team we support, it usually results in less objectivity, and it certainly won't help the team or player to improve.",,,"If we keep playing at this rate, all the targets that skipped us for Barca will have the last laugh and their decision vindicated. 

At this rate, the Roman era of hiring and firing managers makes more sense and more effective than the 'lets build a clear football philosophy ' bullshit. 

This is premature, but honestly the only good performance we've had was against Spurs. The matches that we've won, we've done so with extra help from VAR or just scrappy football. If Tuchel and the team think they can keep playing like this for the long term and expect results, I would not mind Tuchel and the team leaving Chelsea. This is just fucking embarrassing!

But it seemed like we were hoofing it cuz there was no connection from back to front. Midfield was MIA massively. Just cross and inshallah. Midfield needs to be more dynamic. They need to be faster and more disciplined to allow for our wide players to have more space. Fulham didn't need to defend the 10 position at all.

Walk the talk?I guarantee, if we sign an elite manager tomorrow and kick potter out, we will see a sharp rise in form within the next 3 matches. I'm willing to put actual leverage on that.

Everyone that's trying to appear smart with the 'our squad is bad' take - Isn't. The players we have, on paper, with the Right manager for the job, will be way higher on the table they are now.

I have zero clue how he keeps being the focus. He did far more than Fofana, yet here you are acting like Fofana gave us anything only because he's *not* Havertz. Did you watch Mount, Gallagher, Hutchinson, anyone else today? They were all abysmal, only Ziyech and Havertz had the odd moment. And that's the height of what we're doing at the moment, so why are we *again* starting our criticism with the best of a terrible bunch? Get everyone else out first, then we'll see how bad he really is. 

I don't really care whether it's popular or not. I know better about what strikers need to do than any other role on the pitch and I tell you what I see.

You would think we were on 3 points or something with this sort of rationale.",,His fanboys are everywhere in this thread. His are one of the most dedicated.,"Let them, it's all they have.",I don’t think so. Our midfield and defense struggled with the press from the start. They exposed Gallagher’s lack of composure in the midfield immediately and forced tons of errors from him and jorginho. Koulibaly couldn’t handle the press at all and was frustrated by aaronson in the first 10 minutes. They clearly had a game plan and it was better than ours. Those mistakes by us were forced by them. They pressed extremely well and our lack of a midfield was exposed horribly. We were reliant on CBs to break the press and they made a lot of mistakes accordingly.

The only slight shred of credit I’ll give him is that the squad turnover has been so high with injuries and newcomers and the glimpses of what we could be are there.

And i suspect when we become good under Potter, people will revert back to talking about how great he is at building teams and how good his Brighton was

Klopp needed 4 years at Liverpool. SAF needed 7 years at Man United. Arteta needed 2 seasons at Arsenal and was almost sacked after a terrible run of games. Pep needed only a season at City but hes a special manager. Building a team and a project takes time, its never a smooth ride in the start, there will be bumps and oh boy have we felt the bumps in the road right this season","Bro, one is 18, one is 19?🤣🤣 relax","I think those too showed instant chemistry, all things considered. Disappointing day but I have hope for the UCL match",Yeah but people cared. This team seems fine being mid table,"I don’t know why some dick is calling you an Arsenal fan, I’ve supported chelsea my entire life and I could not agree with you more. Let’s say we for some daft reason sack potter right now, and bring in let’s say Pochettino. What improvement are people expecting?","We still have to question whether or not Kante would be in good form when coming back as he's missed a lot of football. My point is that those teams I listed are more complete teams with better work rate and chemistry.

Noticed how I left out Bayern, Liverpool, Barcalona, Spurs, etc. Because like you I belive Chelsea can win the CL, but the problem is all these 3 teams are too good this year for them not to cause us any issues.",,"I thought Havertz was very visible , but for the wrong reasons",,"True. Azpi can be used there every once in awhile probably. He's had some pretty good performances under potter (and poor), but I doubt his legs will be under him enough to play there very often and depends on the matchup.

If cucu or chillwell can play there (don't know, never seen em used there), I agree that would be the best option.","We haven’t beaten them in years and they’ve been shit the entire time. 

We’re also kinda shit, don’t get me wrong, and they’re better than they were at the start of the season, but if we had attacking players who could actually produce (bar mount) we’d have beaten them easily today.",So would I but the wing backs are essential and he can't play as a 6,,,"all the money spent, nothing has changed. arguably even worse lol",,,,Average at best lol,,,,"Did you see Pulisic when he came in.

We'll get a win then for sure..,Fofana was a lot better tbf,After the last 2 transfer windows recruitment for next season should be the least of our worries. We need to clean house before we add anyone.,Hall has played well over the last few games? One bad game as an 18 year old does NOT make you mediocre.,It really was. The thing that annoyed me most was that he just never once looked up to see what was on. Terrible from a forward.,The players and the coach then were far far better. In my mind the players were complacent after the title win  and when the poor results starting coming in we didn't cope well mentally. Don't think they were trying to sabotage Mou.,"Except we’ve signed the veterans to new extended contracts. 

They won’t leave. 

Who would pay Koulibaly 300k a week… I had no problem signing him but not on those wages. Although if they’re incentive based well he’s never getting that.

Azpi is a liability.",I know it was so shit from him but honestly he's been good for us recently so I hope the fans don't abuse him online like they used to.,,"I tried to tell people that Alonso was a perfectly capable backup LB and that splurging for Cucurella was a waste. But no, here we are.",,Arsenal are going through a bit of a wobble in form the last couple of weeks and really need to beat Forest tomorrow to get back on track. If they fail to do so then they’ll be there for the taking IMO.,They can. Doesn’t mean I have to like it.,"I'm not sure because I've not watched Man United play often so far this season. I think long term, Broja is your link up forward when teams sit deep and Aubz is your off the shoulder counter attacker.

I don’t pay attention to Serie A but he’s just not the player he used to be from the looks of it.,"Amen dude. 


Pep couldn't do shit with this team.

Too much leftover Roman mentality. Firing managers is not a sustainable solution or a level headed reaction to this situation which has so many factors out of Potter's control.","Can someone link this fella the Arsenal sub. The poor little lamb is lost.

""Despite a Champion's League win"" 🤣",Maybe I'm still comparing him to his previous self where any shot at our goal was likely to go in. He made a couple of good saves today - nothing special.

He managed to deal with Salah and the likes fairly easily,,We dont have the players for it due to buying to accomodate Tuchel.,I agree. Trev can play RB. But who knows what the plan was if KK wasn’t injured.,"Ya ofc. He offers absolutely nothing. Can't pass, can't dribble, can't shoot. I haven't seen anything generational.

Thats his natural position.,"The craziest thing is he is a good manager but he's drawing just as many games with Chelsea as he did with Brighton, which is almost impressive by itself.

He's knackered if he doesn't get them scoring 2+ a game soon",We see young promising players who show flashes of quality. Yeah they’re mediocre but considering they’re teenagers they’re pretty damn good,"We’ve won 1 game or some shit in the last 9 games. We’re not playing youth. We’re playing the best players we have available.  There’s a time and place to blood youth players in, and this situation isn’t it. These types of matches can be extremely demoralizing and May wreck a young player’s confidence forever if he makes a critical error and gets chastised for it.","Really good? We beat Milan twice when they were missing their best player (Theo Hernandez) and in one of those games they got a red card in the 20th minute.

Apart from that I don't remember any impressive results or good games. There was never a ""good"" phase, just two or 3 wins in a row ONCE.","Really? I don't like to jump on players or managers but they all look a bit clueless at the moment. Very concerning.

City will put 6 past us if we play like that again.",Tbf Chilwell is great at bombing forward but he did that mainly when we played 5 ATB so he had 2 CBS behind him. This is a 4 ATB so Cucu's much more exposed if he bombs it forward,,"Is like this every week, but yeah this sub is insufferable during a bad loss like today.",,"So 4-3-3 without a rb and a defensive midfielder. Iteresthing idea you must play fifa a lot, dont you?",Absolutely. Pulisic has looked great since Potter came in. I’d love to see him start with Broja.,"Yeah and even in this match it's a daft comparison. Bakayoko cost us the game in his disasterclass against Watford, Havertz was bad but not 1/10 bad.",,,I take these polls every match and never see the result lol. Are they a separate thread or is this post updated after results are in?,,,,![gif](giphy|3ohhwMULIutDIMNh28),,,,Puli was just signaling how many times he was going to turn possession over in the first 2 minutes of coming on,"Chilwell was great, made the difference.

I think Cucu is still good and it's great that the position has some competition for starters.",,"yes lmao, forgot its Harvey",Sterling had a big miss too. RLC could have maybe gotten his head on one possibly. Looks like we are gonna rely on our defenders scoring again this year,
570,Please Guus Hiddink please come save us,,"Thankfully, the one thing Potter got right was leaving Auba out of the CL squad.","You should worry about our whole squad while Potter is the coach, all of the players will be out of form and frustrated then no one else will want to join Chelsea and every player will want to leave... It's simple really.",Why are scummy Leeds fans coming here saying this shit. Fuck off you cunt.,sell to Championship,Ugh.. Kids.,"Oh, the 18 and 19 year olds have time to improve? Thanks for that groundbreaking commentary","Yeah and if our players could actually fucking finish, we would have been.","Diers shit mate. Davies is incredibly average too but plays 3atb and gets away with it. Koulibaly would probably be spurs best defender if he played in that team.

Sacking him doesn't achieve anything I agree. Neither does keeping him, real issue is that our squad is awful. However playing Chilwell in dead rubbers and not wrapping James up in cotton wool is contributing to our issues. Our board not going all out for Enzo is also making our situation worse. At least with United when they see an issue they spend what's needed, see Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro e.g.

Today he played a youth team with underperforming senior players so we got what was expected.

Potter is here to oversee a rebuild. Maybe he does better with better players maybe he doesn't, but e.g. I don't see what he's done that's any better than say Frank Lampard did for us, in fact that situation was much harder because he couldn't use the transfer market and lost Hazard.

I'm all for giving him until end of season to fix up but if results continue like this no way should we be keeping this guy.","What use of that shape if it got figured out in the 2nd half every single match, and Potter had no idea or plan on how to neutralize it back to get us in the game. This had happened a few too many times this season.",It’s 100% by instruction in this match? Both fullbacks were selective going forward until we were chasing the point.

Arsenal had their worst scoring run in 34 years under Arteta… Arteta admitted himself that he lost sleep over how bad Arsenal’s form was and that he questioned himself every day.

Salah literally missed an open goal today as well… what’s your point? It’s not always going to be perfect for a player. Huge names have bad touches or miss goals too. But for some reason people think Havertz should never have a bad touch. If we played Werner today instead of Havertz, every long ball would have not been contested. In fact I will give Havertz some praise and say his game with his back to goal is getting better. Likewise if we played Lukaku today, we wouldn’t have had anyone pressuring up top. Havertz is not a complete player but he did great for our play style and ran like a mad man today. I think some of you forget that we were down to 10 men today. Havertz isn’t going to get 20 goals a season but some of you act like he should never ply for us","No it fucking didn't. 2 fucking dog shit calls cost us today.

James = great start but faded. Almost got into fight with the one guy bigger than him (Antonio)

Cucurella = passive today. Some poor passing decisions. Terrible corner deliveries. 

Chilly B (sub) = MOTM as a sub. Crazy goal and great assist. 


RLC = lazy off the ball - just doesn’t seem to understand where he should position himself to be a proper outlet to his teammates when we have the ball. Too passive on the ball, had opportunities to lead counters and would slow things down instead. Decision making is wasting his physical talents IMO. 

Jorginho (sub) = ffs. More terrible decision making with the ball in our defensive third. Mistake should have led to goal but VAR on our side this time


Gallagher = runs around a lot. Didn’t do much else productive. Couple good corner deliveries but some bad ones too 

Mount (sub) = meh as sub appearance. Had one shot / cross to back post that was overhit. 


Kovacic = meh. Not bad, not great

Havertz (sub) = actually scored. Great finish actually. Lots of shithousery at the end.


Sterling / Pulisic = meh. Mostly just dropped deep and recycled possession. Sterling had some dangerous crosses towards the end. Pulisic had one nice opportunity early but think VAR would have called him offside had something come of it.

The money we spent over the summer was cash we had to spend on replacements, some are an upgrade (Sterling) some aren't ( Koulibaly). TT still hasn't had a chance to have a proper pre-season with his players. He also didn't get the opportunity to spend money in the area most in need of it imo central midfield.

Yes and the ridiculous merry go round of managerial sackings and no long term plan to go with manager over players has led us here, to a broken squad with no cohesion.

WE should sit back and wait for a counter attack goal.

Chelsea clearly can't get through 4 layers of defenders, we've been trying it forever and we can't get past a low block.

We should sit back, invite some pressure, give them more possession, let them get out of their side of the pitch - then when we knick the ball with some of our very good tacklers (Silva/Kante/Kova/Apzi) we can hoof it to our speeders (Reece/Chilly) or attackers (Mount/Auba) then they can run Torres style and do a counter attack goal.

Blame has been pointed at the players. You can say we looked more direct and that made us look better today, sure.

We had 2 such breaks and there has been no improvement whatsoever over either of them. Is there even coaching being done? What is going on.,It's been better for 5 years now.,"Despite being the better team on the pitch, we struggled to create great chances, just half chances. Our attackers have 0 killer instinct and compusure in the box. So disappointing.


Mount looks so low on confidence, he's barely able to string 2 passes together, and he seemed to misplace or mistime simple through balls. I love the guy for what he's given us and will always support him as a player and person, but his future looks bleak with Nkunku and possibly Felix coming in.


Mudryk had a couple of really good moments where he ran through a couple of players like they weren't there, but his finish let him down. Can't wait to see him week in week out.


Thiago and Jorgi on it.


Cucu looked really sharp.


Conor gave his 100% as usual but seems to really lack the guile to unlock a defense.


Badiashile looks really calm and promising, didn't struggle for a second.



Havertz had some great interceptions, but didn't contribute anything to the attack.


Ziyech had some great passes that found noone.



All in all a really boring and frustrating game, with Mudryk providing the only spark, looks pacy and tricky. Hyped about him so far.

Will take those two smashing the ball into row Z and passing it to the crowd over Pulisic doing *nothing*.",We shall see.,It absolutely is the players.,"In this particular match, but what about all the other matches where we have needed a goal? In reality Cucurella doesn’t have the technical ability or speed to bomb forward. Azpilicueta is the exact same. Sure they can cross from deep, but they aren’t modern, attacking fullbacks. That’s why we struggle to create anything when James and Chilwell are injured, they are the main source of our creativity and huge goal threats on top of that. Especially James of course. Azpi and Cucurella just don’t offer that whatsoever.",,"Did Tuchel had a pre season, and he also come in middle of the season?",,Boehly should've hired a sporting director/ scout team first thing and trusted the people that were in charge at least for 1 summer before sacking everyone with football knowledge & experience.

He needs to feel his way through this squad so it's somewhat understandable.

Should have had another attacker on the field from the start though and been a back 4 right away. Back 5 ain't it with reece out.","You do realize he scored last start, assisted cameo before that, played a great ball to ziyech in cameo before that in limited time?

I agree ziyech played poorly but i think the LCB of zagreb owned him which why tuchel switched him to the other side.

Ziyech did get a shot off the rebound which the keeper did well to save

His crossing accuracy was definitely off today, he is normally better

Need to give this team another 10 games and evaluate.",,,,"Nobody's frustrated at Potter, there are (thankfully) still a few people in here not bending over backwards to convince themselves that sacking Tuchel was the right move. Expect to see that for some time unless we drastically and immediately and rightfully so.

He makes some good hold ups, back heels or a good through ball and then proceeds to lose the other 80%, mistime headers, get out bodied and not necessarily by super strong defenders. He’s just way too poor overall despite his A game looking pretty. We don’t need style, we need some physicality out of someone besides Thiago and Reece. 

Mount tried to show some today but he’s out of position a lot and probably has to do with having a shit midfield behind him and Havertz playing so fucking wide the whole time. Soton was giving us the middle of the field  after the goal but neither the plan nor Jorgi can take advantage.","I was also surprised no one was there, not Broja, not Sterling not RLC to tap that in.

I don't see his actual value in any of the counters or any attack in general. At the least this season.","Fabregas was always better further forward, his didn't have the all around game that Enzo has shown he has. You'd never want Fabregas as a lone 6 for instance. It's not really a wild thing to say, Fabregas was a great player, but he was much better going one way than he was going the other.


There's a reason at Barcelona he ended up being a false 9 most of the time, and it wasn't just who his midfield competition was.",He was awful today so many pass miss and poor vision. I don’t think he’s fit for a top team,"Yup he has poor vision. Failing to see what he brought to the team since his arrival outside of the goal. 

He hasn’t improved as a player at all since he arrived. He’s gotten worse, actually",NO this is actually sad he has showed up recently!,"Yea, cos our football was really impressive and exciting to watch under him 🙄

The reactions in this sub are ridiculously shortsighted. The football at the end of the Tuchel reign was atrocious. Some of the worst I've ever witnessed. And now, Tuchel is gone. Grow up. Move on ffs

Yes we were poor, yes we have a lot to do to make top 4. We are a team in transition. We have a hodge podge squad from constantly firing managers, the answer is not fire this one too.. 

2 years ago, everyone was laughing at arsenal and arteta. He's not good enough, he's a fraud, arsenal are going in the wrong direction, yada yada yada. Now, with some continuity, and TIME, they are a well oiled machine.

We have 2 years, this season included, of pain to endure. It's not suddenly going to just fix itself. We need continuity and we need time to get all parts of the club moving in the same direction. I'd rather take short term pain for long term sustainability and success versus chopping and changing every 18mo

If it's too hard for you to watch and deal with, switch off the TV, and stay off reddit.","Last time he played as a wingback. It was a back 3 with Cucurella in the back 3, and Hall and Loftus-Cheek as wingbacks. He was very clearly playing as a LWB/LB today as well.",,In what way is Pulisic close to being a top player?,,"Not sure, but if Tuchel and Potter haven’t even given him a chance, it’s not looking good. 


But yes since we locked up the group it’s probably a good idea.","Up until the Kova sub we were getting outnumbered in midfield, Mount had to press higher up which left Jorgi and Ruben to defend vs 3 or more United players. No individual was particularly a weak link, it was just a tactical issue. When Kova came on we used a midfield diamond so United weren't able to play through the middle as easily, but we also struggled to get into promising offensive situations and more often than not didn't have enough support when we did. Ruben was very average because he was very safe in possession, and opted to slow things down by winning fouls instead of trying to make things happen offensively. 

He's simply more suited to playing a more offensive role, playing so deep has shackled him in a way. He's afraid to take risks on the ball, in big games especially. But we all know how effective he can be if he's confident and constantly looking to drive the ball into the final third.","I haven’t heard that comparison, but it’s a good shout tbh.

Keeping him absolutely achieves something - it shows that the board have faith in him and player power does not win.

Our press is aimless, our tactics are all over the place, our passing phases leave us in our own third far too often with little to no outlet in place, players can't/don't/won't work hard for him, he selects players that have GLARING shortcomings for their roles (like selecting Kovacic and Jorginho in a midfield 2 when neither are dynamic or good ball winners or capable of longer passing when required)  there's no identity to our play... whatever Potter is doing is just not resonating with any of these players at all, it's palpable.

End of the day, injuries or not, we've lost significant amount of points from poor management. Not that the other issues haven't contributed to that either, but they're not the cause of it.

>Secondly, why is Tuchel to be blamed if you already agree the squad is not good enough? Doesn’t that reinforce that he achieved far more with an incompetent squad?

Tuchel definitely overperformed with this squad, but at the same time he took decisions to resume the regression e.g. handing new contracts to certain players, allowing certain players to leave, not recognising key issues in the squad, misprofiling players.

Top 4 should be ultimate priority and if we have to do by cutting some games by getting knocked out, then please.","Pulisic needs to be starting 11.

Unless we give them proper run of games, they would always be either miss or hit as a sub. 

Pulisic and Broja needs to start.",All the weird benchings woke something lol,,,How many picks do we have,,,,"Damn, we gotta live with this L for that long ☠️",,,,Running around in circles and passing the ball back,"Could it be the chemistry/understanding he develops with other players, his reading of intent and opportunity? He really worked well with Broja, the new kid on the block!",,Next post it'll be 90m 🤣🤡,Dude! Another performance with him more interested in little squabbles than doing his actual fucking job.,
604,"Sadly I don’t have the funds/time to watch the matches but fuck me this sucks. I just don’t know what to say… I honestly thought Potter would be the man to lead us to a prize, but I feel like he just hasn’t won enough things to realise that bad form on our level is lethal to any hopes. You lose with Brighton for a while, you can still end up in the top half by winning the rest and achieve your seasonal goals. You lose with us for a while, you don’t participate anymore… the most he could achieve now is probably 6th. And that’s a big ask",,"He’s only 19, Give him time. A loan move is probably best in the summer.",I agree. It comes from the top. Our manager is soft so they all follow suit. How they weren't outraged that it was only a yellow blows my mind,xG matters when displaying proof of progress which is what everyone said they wanted.,Just replay the game,"> Only someone with no understanding of football would be so negative about todays match. 

Go to response for Potter heads..","Nah, ziyech is gaining his confidence back. In a month he'll be undroppable",We need consistency not hype. We need a winner not an experiment. We need grit not mediocre mentality.,I agree it should be reece. From next season. Permanently,"We’re horrific at counters too. Had a few chances yesterday, two with pulisic, one where he didn’t pick his head up in time and the other I think he was swarmed. Think there were others two, game was very open at some points.",I find that interesting because KDB and Silva kept trying to force it down the middle. They went wide because they had to,,Amen! I trust the process!,,Getting out of groups is not a big achievement mate. That 9 games unbeaten is such a sham.,Ruben?,Wanting to start Broja over Auba is ridiculous. Broja flashed a lot today but his decision making still has a ways to go before he can consistently start for a top 4 PL team. If he picked his head up at key moments today we have at least 2 extra shots on target and one was a tap in likely goal IMO. Auba is much more consistent and composed than he is at the moment.,,,"The word you are looking for is ""Ziyech""",,,,"Love the guy.  Has been a great steward of the club, but this reminds me of Terry’s last days.  Him and Sliva together in the middle isn’t gonna get it done.",,,,Ego. He assumes that he should be able to implement his system and players should be able to fill in wherever he puts them,Because the threat of what he can do offensively doesn’t allow their attack to completely pin us in. Cucurella is a dribbler but he can deliver and certainly can’t beat someone wide. This is CFC…there needs to be a certain arrogance or confidence that we play our style and strength and force the other team to adapt to it not adapt to theirs. Especially at home,,Of course you don't because FIFA is easy.,We seriously need to see more of Broja.,
605,"The 10 minutes we saw of Mudryk were amazing, he took a shot (1 of 3 total?) and had what seemed to be 90% of the total crosses into the box for Chelsea.  

Sterling played ok, other than zero crosses, one shot almost every pass seemed backwards.  

But give Graham time….he has a plan…",,"He needs a loan for sure, he’s raw

He can’t help but fall over and slip every time he’s in the penalty area",Funny but Peacock at least never even showed a replay of the kick to the head and all the players called to the medical staff right away.So it must have been really bad. Fingers crossed for Dave,ziyech's wasn't 50/50 tbf,Just watch the full 90 minutes again,Get off Potter's lap.,Which game were you watching?,They also play in a farmers league. Our best performance all season came against the Italian champions,">His output is abysmal and he’s a horrific footballer

|-|-|-|-|",[deleted],[deleted],,,I can’t even blame Tuchel for this. Every single player just went out there and played about as bad as they could.,,,,Can’t believe I had to scroll this far for this comment. Playing him as a cb in a back 4 was suicidal and Potter paid for it. He’s absolutely finished,,,,It’s the Tuchel way.,"Fofana solid, Broja good with his energy and half chances, Gallagher meh",,"Genuinely, you would have to be incredibly deluded",Just like those final games against Liverpool ...very depressing even for the players and TT,
606,"Where is the grit and determination? This is a London derby, this is Chelsea v Spurs. Mount was the only one I felt was passionate about winning and who seemed to want to back his teammates. It's no good having multi-million signings if they don't want to fight.

No-one looked motivated, some of them might be too new to appreciate the occasion but most have been in the club long enough to know better, even W. Fofana has been in the prem long enough to know what Chelsea v Spurs means.  I don't think they were properly fired up by the coaching staff.

Shocking set-pieces set up; Mount marking Dier who is actually great in the air is just dumb as fuck, Mount's never been good aerially. On the other side, why don't Mount and Ziyech take corners anymore? A lot of their assists came from corners.

I still like Havertz as a player but I'm completely done watching him at ST, give me Auba/Fofana or if we must use a false nine put Felix there. I can imagine a true striker having the instincts to better anticipate that little, inventive Mount flick for example.

A few good things because I must search for some to suppress my rage; Sterling looked very dynamic again and looks like he's recovered completely from his injury, Mount looked a little better on the ball, RJ and Chilly stay uninjured. Wow. I think that's about it.",,"What does Chuk bring to the team? What position does he even play? Cost a couple chances vs Liverpool, and that horrible touch today. Didn’t defend, didn’t press. Loan him out.",Gotta laugh to keep from crying,More that he gave control to Dortmund,2022/23 fail comps of mount and Kai would take quite a while to compile tbf,"I personally doubt you watch football five years ago,u probably can't answer questions about Chelsea events that happen 10 years without a Google research,both potter and ""fans"" like you should look for another club.","![gif](giphy|2XskdWuNUyqElkKe4bm)

What game were you watching?","Find it hard to sack a manager when he’s dealing with a starting 11 of injuries to our best players and who inherited a bloated squad of expensive flop signings from a combination of 7 previous managers.  The ones who aren’t injured are poor and make individual errors every match. If we had a fully healthy squad, I may agree with you, but we’re a long way off that.",He's nowhere near as good as he can be. He played much better in the WC because he actually cares. This is his day job and I'll bet my house that he's out the door ASAP in the summer. Remember the press release he gave about parting ways with his agent? He would manage his own career etc etc. He's not the only one either,"Edu Mendy without a doubt, has fallen off now though.","But not 10 at once though mate to key players and as I've said after a buy out with a whole new staff and a bloody WC!

There is no debate, you're chatting shite.",,except he did multiple times,,"That makes no sense, though. Tuchel played with wingbacks.","The attackers are isolated by choice. They never drop deep to make things happen, all they do is ask for the ball into space and then fuck it up when they get it","Yeah, I thought Broja played well overall.  But, his inexperience showed a bit, he did so much work to get into a great position and just needed to square the ball to Mount.  RLC's passing is pretty bad, TBH.  People complain about Jorgi's easy passes but RLC makes a meal of those.  There was a match earlier in the year where he tried to play the ball out to the wing but put it directly at the opposition.  Got lucky because they weren't expecting it, got it back and did it again for good measure.  He puts no zip on the ball either when he does get it right.  I want him to succeed as much as anyone but he makes some fundamental errors.",,,I take the pick,,,,Yeah extremely unlucky that the ball hit both of his legs there,,,,"It’s fucking frustrating. He doesn’t get the best out of Kai, Mason or Puli.","Someone's gotta have faith in Mendy I suppose... I think we've all gotta come to terms with the fact we desperately need a new keeper, at this point I'd start Kepa or even Bettinelli over him.",,"He also made a lot of runs that were customarily ignored. In fact this season he has made the most progressive run of any player in the league.

He put in a shift and helped us grind out a win.","The official statement from the premier league said that he had too much hair and it wouldn't have happened if he got a haircut

/s",
607,"Chelsea's game plan:

1. Somehow get possession

2. Pass around the back, to the wings, and back

3. Keep passing around the back and wings

4. A few more passes around the back and wings

5. Have no one make a run (Joao Felix is new, so he's not following the plan)

6. Lose possession 

7. Repeat from 1

Note: make a few changes squad wise, but the plan remains the same.",,I like Chuk and he’s very young but why the hell did he come on over Mudryk?!,Anyone but that spursy bottler,"Can should have been too tbh. He gets booked then a couple minutes later fouls our player again, shouts at the referee very aggressively and goes about his day. Ziyech did the same later in the game and got booked for dissent. There was no difference between the aggression. Ziyech was rightfully booked but Can gets a 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th chance to rectify his behavior.","Yeah, I don't know how many managers it takes to realise that buying a world-class CAM and playing him as a 9 with no strike partner isn't going to work. 3 managers in a row can't seem to grip this concept, why is every manager obsessed with playing Kai as a striker","One of the best centrebacks of the modern era on a free is a lot different than €70m for a player you’d want to be bombing up and down the entire left side of the pitch for the next 4 years, be fucking realistic",Not sure what that has to do with my comment,"Mate that was a good fucking freekick. Freekicks that hit the post/bar and are tapped in on a rebound are good freekicks. It's not much different from a long shot being tapped in on the rebound. The pass to Azpi though yeah, that was a big mistake.","Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here and as you said we could have had better fixtures but as a football club we have never been used to losing this many games in such a short span of time.

I am still waiting for a proper response to all those bad performances/results and it's getting harder to defend anyone with each game.",I mean the goal went through his legs. He should have done way better on that,"Reus was injury prone. Kante is injury prone (hamstring). Separate impact injuries to different parts of the body do not equate to injury proneness, they are bad luck. If after reece and chilly recover only to reinjure a previously injured body part, that's being inury prone.



It would also be injry prone to have a degenerative condition, which has not been shown to be the case.



I totally reject they are injury prone. I'll accept that they have bad luck and have had a bad spell of injuries. I fully believe they can fully recover and stay healthy though.",,Potter and the players are all a part of the problem when we lose. If James continues this injury streak it won't be barring James.,,He would have been far better than Pulisic,"Cool I can play hypotheticals too. If Mendy had played today we would have been down 3-1 already and that goal wouldn’t have mattered.

Nice ad hominem btw, I bet you wear a helmet when your mother takes you on walks.","I mean that’s recency bias talking there. He’s had good games and goals and contributions. Just not enough, and not enough lately.",,,Pulisic and Ziyech needed to go. Zaha and Gordon were available. I know there are problems in midfield but those two could have transformed our team. Taken sterling and Havertz to another level. But instead we will watch this slow car crash try to stumble to January within touching distance of 4th at best. But it could turn out a lot worse too,,,,100M of that is in the bench :),,,,If against west Ham he still play Havertz up top then he completely lose my support,Everyone makes mistakes even prime Terry.,,"He’s got 0 goals and 0 assists. He can barely beat a man, his decision making is bad, and lately his touch has been shit in tight situations. 

Moving him to his “proper” position, which nobody even knows where that really is, isn’t going to Magically put him in form. He’s been in poor form for about a year now, bar a 3 or 4 game stretch last season. He was poor playing behind Lukaku as a #10, he has been poor playing as a sole #9, and he was poor playing with a striker partner with 2 up top. What position does he play well?",Played well though but yeah that missed sitter was hot garbage,
608,"Guys, let's be honest, would you keep doing your hard work if you knew you were going to be paid 60 millions if you were fired?  After paying UK taxes, this is approximately £300k.  You can literally pay half a year's rent for your apartment in London and relax, instead of working hard at a job where everyone hates you and waiting for the next American to buy a club in the Premier League. I’m not even mad at him",,Dude just enjoy the moment.,"Azpi is fine and in hospital now. 

Our club is not with this clown managing it.",[deleted],I don’t think Fofana is on the UCL list unfortunatly,"We saw what happened with Di Matteo and Avram.  A short term boss is for the short term.  Potter seems clueless amd out of his depth, and the moment he loses the dressing room, he has to go.  Obv its impossible to know from the outside the players perspective of the coach, but its hard to believ they have loads of faith in him.

Players like Felix, Thiago Silva and Enzo joined us for the chance to win a CL.  That dream always needs to be deemed realistic in order to attract the best quality prospects on the planet.","I'm not his biggest fan, but he was class today. Could have had 2 assists.",">It’s solely his job to ensure they don’t down tools.

It's not as easy as it sounds. He can't work miracles, the form under Tuchel was also wretched.

>And they very much may be well run clubs. I even said I can excuse all of the dropped points if he showed something promising. He works with the entire squad in training every week, not just his preferred 11. We should still see an identity even if we lose.  
>  
>Genuinely what do you see from him that says yup Potter is the guy no question about it?

Even if Potter isn't right for us, I want to see this squad overhauled and then judge him on that. The squad is not good enough, both in terms of talent and mentality.","They were playing with hunger because they knew if they didn't impress the new manager they might not get playing time. At this point they don't want to be out there under this manager.

The Bournemouth game is an excellent example of why we should be worried about Potter. We played a good first half. Then when at half-time both managers got to make adjustments we looked much worse. Happened when we played Nottinham Forest too mind you. Same thing with City. Last game we looked not awful. Over a few days Pep rethinks things, Potter rethinks things. They both come out with their updated plan and Potter gets absolutely smashed.

Silky smooth passing is not enough. We have high pass completion %, decent possession and we aren't creating any good chances. It's just passing for passing sake.",Fabregas would look tragic in this side,"So you are saying a player cannot improve technically in their 20's? That is the stupidest shit I've ever heard.

Drogba got technically better in his 20's as an example of millions of players who improve. I'm not sayin every 20 year old can be trained to be a modric but to write off a talented youngster as he's 22 is bollox.",,Jorginho played pretty well today considering he was a one-man midfield again,,Should he not be starting over Pulisic?,The form Mendy is in you can’t possibly know that.,"He didn’t score last game, and the assist was a simple pass for a wondergoal come on now…he was shocking in his Zagreb cameo and shocking before that, I hope he gets back to proper form but you can’t just say that he’s suddenly great now that he’s getting minutes. He used to be a starter and there’s a reason he stopped getting minutes",,,"The few times Reece got around him and whipped in excellent crosses, nobody gambled on the near post",,,,Didn't buy a midfielder lol. Instead got a Zakaria who has no confidence from playing in that juve side lol,,,,I try to never get too attached to any Chelsea manager. Such is the cycle of football.,Needs to be dropped and would love it if we went for someone like Oblak in January,,Lmao the excuses for Havertz are incredible,Preach. Imagine not feeling confident about a Spuds game at the Bridge.,
609,"I haven’t been sold one way or the other on Potter, taking the wait and see approach with all the new players but this game has swung me hard to sacking him.

The players are visibly dejected, there hasn’t been any sign of chemistry and growth in the attacking third. The left hand doesn’t seem to know what the right hand is doing.

Once a manager loses a locker room, there’s not much to do about it but move on. The players are playing with zero confidence and seem to just be digging deeper into the funk.",,The standards are through the floor.,Enzo has played every minute since he's arrived and until today hadn't played with another natural CM. He's probably just a bit tired.,"I missed the game, what did he do?","Badiashille not in CL unfortunately, more problems for this club lol",I don’t think Mourinho can be as bad as this. At least he will show some passion for it.,lol,"Chopping and changing managers after starting to change the philosophy is stupid. 

If he isn’t competing next season he will go. 

Sacking a manager won’t stop Azpi, Kante and Jorginho being finished. It won’t stop Havertz and Mount being incapable of making 10 yard passes to the attacker. It won’t stop the wingbacks from being perpetually injured. 

I don’t have any loyalty to Potter, but I don’t think it’s right to sack him at this point. Brighton didn’t become what they were in just 6 months.","Dier is shit man, put him in our team and not with two/3 holding midfielders that run around for days and he'd be exposed. Bit like how David Luiz and Cahill were the best defenders in the league when Kante and Matic were locking down the midfield

If you let potter go you potentially have a manager that can get results short term but also oversee a rebuild. We're blindly putting faith in a guy that's achieved less than the likes of David Moyes and Roberto Martinez. Arguably he's no better than Nuno or Ole.

I disagree squad has regressed in those 4 years we came 3rd last season, our highest finish since Sarri. This is a poor excuse. Our circumstances are not ideal but we should be doing better than 11th. Cups I don't mind since it's man city. But there was fight in big games.",It seems to be similar for a lot of historic Chelsea signings,"Exactly, because we had a medical team and a proper coach.",,"I've been a critic of Jorgi in the past but this seems like a strange game to single him out, he was our best player in midfield today, obviously that's not a huge endorsement though considering the very low bar",,"I’d like you to go to every top 6 side in the league remove their 2 best players and then also take out another 2-3 starters and see how well they play. No RJ, Kante, Koulibaly, Fofana, chilwell coming off a serious injury, Kova playing through injury, 38 yo CB playing every game. I just think it’s wild to expect we’d be playing our best football through this. Get behind the team and move on.","That assumes Mendy even dives for it.

Unless you’re expecting Mendy to somehow shift into Kepa’s body mid save and miraculously Kepa’s hands extend to Mendy’s length to push it outside of the post.

In which case I am all for that.","That was the issue, he was about 3-5 foot away from Havertz twice",,,"Dinamo fan here, his natural role is DM/CM but he is playing as LB because our LB Bockaj is out of form and we don’t have replacement, so Ljubicic is left footed and took that role.  
Sad to see a player with really good qualities wasted on such unnatural position, but hey, it works for now.",,,,No there is still Lukaku,,,,Thanks for the memories,The 10,,"So, how many more millions should we spend to unlock our 70m player??",Is this your first time on the sub?,
610,Enzo was shit today. He took the ball out of kepa’s reach and passed it straight to skipp. Potter is still shit but unless we can bring Tuchel back in I don’t know if there is a manager out there with the balls big enough to takeover a team in such a shitty form,,"With players like Wesley Fofana producing on both ends? Yes.

Piss off trying to stir the pot for no reason.",Aren't you enjoying his work? lol,I’d be happy to pass on Bellingham in the summer based on what I saw today. He’s nothing special.,Chilly looks like he’s still carrying a slight injury imo,"Potter's had some glimpses, let's be honest, his first 2 years they were floating around the relegation zone for most of the season, finishing 41 points both years, and the next year was 10 points better. As good as they were playing under him at the start of this season, it was only 6 games and they played some of the poorest sides this season; West Ham, united at the time were a basket case with the whole ronaldo thing, Leicester were bottom, Leeds didn't know who they were or what they were doing... i think his premier league record is overly flattered, i think he's a decent prem manager, but he's never won a top division trophy, whereas Postecoglu has won with every team he's been with (aside from Melbourne, where he left to take over the Aus National team).

I watch a fair bit of Celtic, more so when he took over, and it wasn't instant by any means, it took a good 8-10 games for them to really bed into his style. But over those 10 games they went from disjointed to just okay football, then 2-3 games later they're suddenly banging in 4 or 5 and flew up the table, reeled in a (i think it was 8 or 9 points?) Rangers lead in the title race, went on to win the league, and he's done the same wherever he's been. Say what you want about Potter, say what you want about the A-league or any other league; he had Brisbane undefeated in 36 games, which was close to 18 months in the A-league. Then took over the aus national team and won the asian cup. Then goes to Japan and wins the league there. Now in Scotland, he's about to win back to back championships.

The guy has the style, the football, and the winning pedigree. If he goes to Liverpool or Tottenham instead, they'll win something under him. If he comes to us, with the talent and buying power at the club now, there's no telling how good we could be, i'm far more sure of that than i am of potter ever coming good.",What?,Cause he needs time,"I don’t understand how this happened

From that ucl win we had such a good foundation to build on.

Great youth players augmenting the squad, jorginho and kova two excellent senior players to usher in new midfielders. 

Ample money to spend on the right players. Absolutely brilliant manager at the helm",Malang sarr played better for us ngl,Well if we aren’t going to stop relying on a lot of these players for next season lets hope that their 3 season plus ‘bad luck’ ends next year then,,"Lol. Win the league. If we wanna win the league we need a mass overhaul. 

If we want to compete against half the prem, we have to drop this midfield.",,"4 of our starting 11 is injured, we’re in a bad spot",Being taller and having longer arms isn't much good if you just stand there looking on in horror as the ball goes in the net which is what Mendy probably would have done with the form he's been in this year.,"omg I want to see that so bad. I'd be fine with broja or auba at the striker.

But, a back 4 with 2 real wingers, a 10 in great form, and a real striker would be amazing. Sterling's and Puli's pacey dribbling on the wings being fed by mount and all of them feeding someone as clinical as auba or physical/athletic as broja would be amazing.",,,That's because he was defending the Lord Ziyechaldo,,,,Please don’t,,,,We have been shit since November. Two good performances against Madrid and Spurs since then. We have to play cautious because we are soft in midfield and are not able to apply pressure in attack. There is no fear factor. It used to be teams would play a low block and that would be our excuse. Now they just outplay us with little effort,I’m hoping because Zakaria is signed for the DM role tuchel would try 4-3-3 with havertz behind broja/aubameyang at top of the midfield against weaker teams similar to how he played at bayer leverkusen,,"> When we get a proper striker and can stop playing him out of position, we will get more out of him

How many years do you think he'll put up with not having a striker before he demands to leave?","I really want to see a front 3 of Sterling left wing, Broja middle and Ziyech right.",
611,10 matches without a win I do not believe I’ve ever been this disgusted,,A million miles away,Anything is better than this fraud be serious,"He could have got James sent off

James was standing over the ball for a free kick and bellingham could have easily got him sent off

Friendship bailing us out there","wouldn't mind a sterling on RW, but completely agree otherwise. if i see mount or havertz starting next week i will lose it","None of those players but maybe Reece was capable of breaking down a low block, you guys are quick to forget that that was one of our biggest issues under Tuchel and we needed a midfielder like Enzo or a Felix/hazard in attack",This might be the single dumbest comment I've read on this sub.  No lie.,">Do you really think boehly will stick with potter the longer we flirt with the bottom half of the table?

Considering he hired him specifically with a LONG project in mind, rather than short term impact, yes I do. 

>He's a businessman, you can't sell/market a club for sponsorship while looking clueless and allowing the valuable asset to just languish in mediocrity with no pragmatism shown.

The clubs marketability isn't going to be destroyed off of 1 bad season. He bought the club not with immediate short term success in mind.","All good.

I’m not saying Tuchel was perfect, but his imperfect self achieved far more than what seemingly could be achieved by Potter. 

When the squad is not good, you need a tactical masterclass to be strong. Tuchel could do that, potter hasn’t shown that. 

For the squad, you need a manager who can work well with the management. We thought that’s what Potter will bring to the table. But it’s total chaos right now. If Auba is so bad, why even play him over a youngster, and why not ship him off? If J5 is so bad and doesn’t fit the system, why are we extending his contract? 

Tuchel achieved despite injuries, Covid, Russian war. Potter can’t seem to even identify an ideal formation!

Rebuild happens on top of success, not by just taking time. We won’t qualify for CL this year, meaning we won’t attract top talent, that’s recursive. Potter won’t call out players when clearly they are shit, that’s recursive. I’m still struggling to see even a single good thing that Potter has done in last 4 months to earn any confidence. Just name one.",Bro scored against spurs and hasn’t done shit since,"No? What you get at 22 is very much what you get at 32. 

The time to teach Gallagher the technical traits he's lacking was 12, if even that late.",,Ramires the head-less chicken? Take him out and I agree with you.,,I’m not denying we’ve been out of form but unfortunately sometimes it takes a loss like tonight’s to realize that change is needed.,"You're saying that like height is the only factor. What about agility, reflexes, reflection?","Our attackers are so inconsistent that we still don’t know who our best front 3 are after 2/3 years of most of them being here.

Last game against West Ham was an improvement in attack, first half was a massive improvement from past games actually. And it will only get better aswell with Felix, Mudryk, Madueke, Enzo settling in more and more.

You can't deny that there has been small steps forward, despite them being very small, they are still steps in the right direction. I don't care about this season, i have already given up hope for this season. What i want from this season is to see improvements made ahead of the summer. I think it was the right decision from the board to get their signings done in January so Potter has more time with them and to implement his way of football and system with them. It can only go up.

I don't care about the form right now. We know the form is bad, and we have not won an away game since October and only 2 wins from the last 12 games. We knew this season was always going to be a struggle with Roman being forced out, Boehly taking over middle of the summer, Tuchel being sacked early into the season with the squad in need of a massive overhaul which Tuchel had pointed out for over a year. He clearly stated it in the preseason aswell ''we have the same problems because we have the same players''

Tuchel was successful because Lampard had laid down the foundation for him to be successful and he had a good setup behind him, everything was perfectly set up for Tuchel. Look at Tuchels last 25 games or so, he had an awful record aswell. The rot started under Tuchel already. Potter took over in a time of chaos with the squad in need of a overhaul, without a scouting setup in place, without a proper medical setup in place aswell.

Our attackers were not creating and they weren’t scoring goals. We constantly relied on the players that usually don’t score goals to put the ball in net. When we reverted back to the mean and those goals dried up, it really exposed our attacking weakness. 

Also, our defense has gotten much, much worse. When we won the CL, it was mostly due to having an amazing defense. Credit is due, Tommy came in that season and really made us a powerhouse on defense.

Progressive passes, passes into final third, into the box, SCA from live ball passes, key passes all absolutely fine and coupled with very high completion rates - that's really good for a striker.

He's also high in progressive passes received, which shows he's consistently available as an outlet, as I keep saying.

He's not underperforming his xG either, he's scoring exactly as much as his xG would suggest, hinting at this being a team problem. He's 84th percentile for shot % on target, so his finishing isn't as bad as you would make it out.

If you're wondering why I think he can be an asset to us, look at players he compares similarly to. Gameiro, Silva, Firmino, Ings, Dzeko, Jesus all on the list - these are all players whose biggest strength lies in being ball-playing strikers, and that doesn't mean being dribblers (why would you focus on a striker being able to dribble? It's a pretty pointless ability for them). It means they show for it, get involved, they're part of the team in possession, move defenders around all while maintaining possession securely. 

That's what Havertz offers.

It’s just something I noticed and it’s something I’d like for him to get out of his game. Or for him to actually start scoring more, especially for the number of shots he takes. Or try to look for the pass","to reply to your well explained comment previously.

firstly his passing stats are at least somewhat inflated by the fact he has played attacking for at least a significant enough period of time to distort his stats a little

most of the places where havertz receives these passes are in non threateing positions out on the wings. He'll drift wide, pick up the ball, make a few touches then pass it back. Thats 1 progressive pass received and a few touches plus a succesful pass added to his stats. what does that do for us?

according to understat he accumulated 4.2xg and 4 goals to show for it this season. 

last season he had 10.67xg and just 8 goals. An average finisher is meant to at least match their xg.

by statitical definition he is a subpar finisher and by watching him play every game, we can see he isnt clinical. Too often he doesnt even get the shot away as hes too slow in pulling the trigger, or too inept in crating the space via his dribbling to score. 

his final third passes will of course be high. we dominate the ball usually and as a a result of kais playstle, he deviates from the striker role and often drops deeper, completes a harmless pass or two and adds onto his progressive stat total without altogether achieviing anything. 

last season he had one of the lowest expected assists per 90 in our attackers, is that not a measure of creativity? 0.14xa

to compare, jorginho is our deepst midfielder and notoriously uncreative and had 0.11. rlc had 0.17, again notoriously uncreative accordig to many here and a deep lying midfielder",Reminds me of Mou’s last stint.,,,Remind us of all the champions leagues titles you won on the last decade ? LOL,,"Are you dim? Were you dropped on your head as a baby or something? Or are you just 23 and lack any world experience?

My point was that you were taking things out of context which is a congested fixture list and half the first team out for long term injuries. 5 first teamers are currently injured. A couple more are only just coming back from injury. That context still applies. 

Yesterday was a prime example. Potter strung together a team of basically second or third string team members, barring maybe two, due to either injury, fatigue, or both. We had to use a recent academy graduate - who usually plays as a CM - as a wing back because of it. This was a team that hardly played together before. And even then, we lost two of our regular bench players to injury in just a single game. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a Chelsea this bare bones before. 

If you expect any team to win under those circumstances against one of the most in form teams in the country, for whom fixture congestion and injuries are not a problem, then you are actually dim. 

Watch a fully fit Chelsea play and see that we are actually very good. We compete for the UCL and top 4 every season and in most seasons, we win at least one trophy. If this is what you consider a “bad” team, then you are either totally entitled, a bandwagoner, or probably both. 

Now if you said “we’re just not very good… at setting up a structure that ensures we have sufficient depth and a good recruitment team”, then I’d totally agree. The lack of depth in the team is frightening and our recruitment policy seems senseless. Probably because we have a revolving door policy for coaches. 

Tell you what. Come back after the World Cup when we have most, if not all, of our first team back and we can chat again.

He'll drift wide, pick up the ball, make a few touches then pass it back. Thats 1 progressive pass received and a few touches plus a succesful pass added to his stats. what does that do for us?

This would make sense if he didn't also score highly for progressive passes, but he does. Not just compared to strikers but forwards in general. Which also addresses the first point - he's compared against all forwards, and forwards in general score more highly in creative metrics than strikers. The fact that he played mostly as a striker yet his creative numbers are decent compared to forwards in general is a pretty good thing. 

>last season he had 10.67xg and just 8 goals. An average finisher is meant to at least match their xg.

He's doing that this season, albeit at a lower rate because we create less. But yes, finishing can and should improve and I've always maintained that. At the same time, though, I also did the math a while ago. Compared to Lukaku, for example, who people say is a good finisher but little else, Havertz ended up more of a goal threat anyway because he got on the end of more chances and the volume won out. And the fact that he drifts around and doesn't just stay central to poach is a good thing - he helps the team create chances that way. Lukaku didn't do it and we looked far worse for it. 

>by statitical definition he is a subpar finisher and by watching him play every game, we can see he isnt clinical. Too often he doesnt even get the shot away as hes too slow in pulling the trigger, or too inept in crating the space via his dribbling to score. 

And yet he was by some distance our top scorer in 2021, and is one goal off our top scorer again this season. Nobody has scored more for us since the start of last season in all competitions. Iirc it was 15 goals in 2021, Mount was next on 9. Again, why are we focusing on Havertz?

>his final third passes will of course be high. we dominate the ball usually and as a a result of kais playstle, he deviates from the striker role and often drops deeper, completes a harmless pass or two and adds onto his progressive stat total without altogether achieviing anything. 

Again, this would make sense if his key passes, passes into the box and SCA weren't also good statistically. But they are. And remember, he's a striker being compared to all forwards - wingers tend to score more highly in these metrics than strikers. Remember also again Havertz' high pass completion rate. That means a lot of these key or progressive passes he plays actually come off.

Here's a direct comparison to a few players who are considered particularly good for their linkup play, which makes them comparable to Havertz. 

https://fbref.com/en/stathead/player_comparison.cgi?request=1&sum=0&comp_type=by_type&spec_comps=big_5&player_id1=fed7cb61&p1yrfrom=2021-2022&player_id2=16ceb862&p2yrfrom=2021-2022&player_id3=3effaa34&p3yrfrom=2021-2022&player_id4=d2416c2e&p4yrfrom=2021-2022&player_id5=4c370d81&p5yrfrom=2021-2022&player_id6=3bb7f478&p6yrfrom=2021-2022 

I think you'll find that his statistics in some of these metrics aren't out of the ordinary at all. Kai gets the most shots on target, he has the highest SoT percentage of them, but he scores much less per shot on target. This is why I keep saying that his finishing needs to improve. However, do the math. Because he gets the most shots off out of all of them, and gets the largest percentage on target, he ends up scoring similar amounts. He's in basically the same range of xG performance as Giroud, Silva, Dzeko (all last season because sample size).

At the same time, he has the highest passing completion rate. And before you say that's all meaningless back passes - he has the highest completion rate in medium and long passes among them. He's very much within the same range of xAG - only 0.03 off Dzeko in first.

His SCA per 90 are only behind Firmino's, and he's the golden standard for false 9 strikers. Ironically, Havertz has the highest SCA among them from dribblings - because like I said, dribbling is not a particularly important skill for strikers and even though Havertz isn't good at it, neither are others, even the best linkup strikers, and it doesn't affect their output much at all.

These numbers should also address the last point - even the best linkup strikers don't put up numbers higher than 0.17 xAG (Dzeko). Giroud, famous for his linkup play, had less than Havertz. Firmino had 0.16 and that's literally what he's all about. Like I said, this isn't a bad value to score as a striker at all. Havertz is at 0.13 over the last 365 days, and that's despite playing in a shit team for most of it. That's just objectively not bad for a striker.

This is why I keep saying over and over that it matters who you compare him to. If you compare him to Haaland on terms of goalscoring then he's going to look shit, but that's not the profile of player he is, nor would that work for us. But he gives us something that this team needs and we're far worse without him, which is why we keep coming back to him every time we try to sign a striker.",todd probably thinks tanking is a thing in football,,,Are you?

Boehly will pay his release clause.,,">Those key passes, progressive passes, sca they all amount to very little

It's a little bit silly to blame Havertz for what the people on the end of Havertz' shot-creating actions, key passes, etc. do with them. That's why I keep saying we should move everyone else on first. He's doing his part to enable them, but who's capitalizing on it? 

>So he isn’t creating much in terms of real output, and he isn’t finishing or getting on the end of much. Going forward we should look to improve and move him on whilst he still has value

You're blaming him for his creative work not amounting to much. And I've just shown you that he does get on the end of things *when there's creation for him*. The ""real output"" you're saying he doesn't produce is the highest goal output in the team last year by a large distance. Moving on the only one of our forwards who actually fits a profile that's working in modern football and keeps up with the metrics of other specialists of that role while keeping everyone else around him would be madness. There's a reason he still has value and everyone else can't be moved on. Intelligent club scouts understand the context of these metrics, what they mean and how they compare. 

>Another issue with havertz is his horrible Vision where he fails to pick out incisive passes, as well his poor touch that lets him down too often. These aren’t shown in stats

... that would be in key passes (that's literally what incisive passes are) and things like miscontrols and dispossessions - they're all there. And not out of the ordinary for the players he's compared to. Firmino and others get dispossessed more often while also putting up very similar numbers for miscontrols.

It's all right there. The stats just contradict you.","I’d rather us finish outside of Europe altogether if we don’t get top four.

Small steps or not, we're another listless attacking performance from being out of the champions league as well.

I'm a big believer as well in ""form is temporary, class is permanent"" but i've never really seen us lift above our current form. Yes i believe there's been small improvements since the back to back city losses, but mate; he's been gradually handed half a billion dollars worth of players since the start of Jan for 1 win in 6, and played 2 of the most out of form clubs in the league and beaten neither of them.

My concern is; what's his ceiling? If this is how bad we are now, how much worse can we get? And more importantly, if this as good as we can play with this squad now, what's our limit under him? Cos right now, this guy doesn't strike me as a manager who will be capable of taking 25/30 points and really contending for the title along side Arsenal, City, Liverpool & United.

No (permanent) manager we've had since Roman first bought the club, has had anything NEAR this bad a record without being replaced, and some of them have had teams as bad as this. AVB was arguably our worst with 49% over 40 games. Potter is on 23 and is at 39%.

Maybe for older, more experienced players it's easy to come as a sub or start after being on the bench for a while. At least that's what I hope, because if Broja corrects on those problems, he will be great for us, plus he's from the academy. And I hate when we spend trucks of money on strikers who then not deliver, when we have good guys from academy. Just previous year examples - we spend so much on Lukaku, we get high expectations, and then we are frustrated when he doesn't deliver, while we have Tammy on the bench. And I don't want to walk into empty comparisons between leagues etc. I just want a player who runs, fights and tries. But many a times I see players not doing enough, not being good enough, and they stay on the pitch, while a teenager could do the same, definitely not worse, and at the same time get more value and much needed experience.

Also, I know it's not my money and so on, but it is a finite resource, so if we, to stick with the example, spend a lot on said Lukaku, but then fail to secure contract for Rudiger, we are in troubles.

The evidence is that guys like mudryk and Felix come in for a couple training sessions are immediately make in impact. Immediately look like the best attackers we’ve had in *years*.

Simply put, Broja was the best attacker IMO, not saying everyone else was shit and should be killed or anything. 

And my point in bringing up those suicide help messages shit is that anytime someone has something remotely negative (I didn’t even say anything negative) about Pulisic, it’s always a crime and hating and results in those type of messages and whatnot.

But i have to say, i saw plenty of positives last night against Dortmund. We played really well and deserved to win the match. This loss isn't on Potter, it's just poor finishing that cost us last night. We played some good, fast pace football last night. We're looking better and better and the results will come soon.

We aren't getting worse though, since the start of Febuary we are seeing improvements in the way we play and amount of chances we create, the attack is more fluid, our counter attacks are faster, and our defense is solid most of the time with the exception of a few brain farts every now and then. And last night against Dortmund is one of the best matches we have played under Potter, after the Milan matches of course. We should have won, but we don't have a goalscorer because Boehly went after 200 midfielders instead.

Potter is a manager who needs time to implement his ideas, just like Klopp does. If we wanted a manager whos going to come in and win straight away, then we wouldn't have went for Potter. People have these unrealistic expectations because we were successful under Roman with sacking managers after every single run of bad form and the interim manager coming in and doing a good job for 6 months and then getting the axe again after a bad run of form. This is not sustainable in the long run, and we will never ever be consistent doing this.

Potter took over a club with no medical staff, with no scouting team set up. He inherited a squad that needed a massive overhaul. Even Tuchel said that in preseason, ''we have the same problems because we have the same players''. The club was in crisis mode after the sanctions just a few months earlier.

Clearly people on here are way dumber or something because simple things like that are taken as insults somehow. Or it just doesn’t translate to here at all compared to face to face. Which is ridiculous but apparently some people do find it hard to understand.

He's got to be the unluckiest manager alive because all the stars SOMEHOW keep aligning for us not to win. 

It's really simple; good managers overcome those things and get draws and wins in games where they didn't deserve to. Potter on the other hand, has found a way to turn 3 performances (where we were arguably the better side in all 3) into 1 goal for, 2 against, 2 draws and a loss.

Anyway, I don't see us staying in the champions league now that we've lost, our form is too poor to even contemplate a two goal turnaround in this tie. The next 3 weeks in the prem will tell the tale; We have Southampton and Leeds, both of whom have sacked their managers in recent weeks, and Tottenham who... well they're a decent side and it is a derby, but they're in almost as awful form as we are. If we come away from those 3 games with 5 points, i'll agree that he deserves more time. 4 points i'll reserve judgement. If we don't win any of those games the discussion really needs to shift to when, not if.

Of course you can get goals elsewhere but to me they are a bonus.

I think there was one late sub appearance where he played alongside Lukaku and one of them scored whilst the other dragged a defender away. They didn't play there together very often at all. 



He's a CAM who helps move the ball up the field with first touch passes (as we saw a couple times today when he dropped further in) and who scores his goal via arriving into the box in space after the defenders have already picked up those in the front 3. He scored 35 out of 36 of his goals for Leverkusen with his first or second touch of the ball.

>We are absolutely rebuilding, that's why there's talk of a big clearout of players in the summer.

Potato/ potato. You cant rebuild a squad you havent built yet.  Its fine to have a massive clearout, but the coach *needs* to complete step 1 to even understand who he can keep of the current crop and who to sell.  If you cant even get buy-in with some of the current crop, there will be problems down the road.

>This isn't fifa, you don't buy 6+ mew starters and immediately think you will start playing good football.

Yes, chemistry issues are expected in the short term, but we have enough quality and talent to overcome that and build a cohesive unit.  The tactic *cannot* be Joao Felix and inshallah forever, but in the immediate term it can suffice as Potters tactics are implemented.  But his tactics arent effective whatsoever right now and Felix isnt signed past this summer.  This leaves a massive issue for us going forward.

Like we played phenomenal for 30 straight minutes in the first half, didn’t concede before half or right after half like we usually do, got a goal from a corner which we never do, and still had 3 or 4 really good chances.

I still enjoyed the game today. Something was missing or probably the opponents figured out chelsea very well. Refreshing was a bit of direct play auba was looking very promising. 


Pls don’t call for players or coach head. Tuchel will bring us over. I think tuchel is much much better than Lampard or di matteo. Most of your guys are so reactionary.

\- **August Briggs** tasting room in Calistoga. Some of my favorite wines ever. They used to do the tasting in their family barn on the vineyard but moved it to a tasting room in downtown Calistoga. So, so good.

\- **Spottswoode** in Saint Helena. Excellent classic Napa Valley style wines, not the super fruity, jammy new world style. Beautiful vineyard and estate. Might have to book a reservation. Even worth just walking around that neighborhood.

\- **Quixote Winery** on the Silverado Trail. Fantastic wines in a really cool setting. I think it's still reservation only. 

\- **Chateau Montelena** in Calistoga is cool just for the surroundings and Chinese Garden, but the wines are meh for the price imho.

\- **Castello di Amarosa** in Saint Helena is a straight up castle.

\- Sandwiches at **Giugni's Deli** in Saint Helena. Honestly THE BEST SANDWICH IN THE WORLD. Make sure you get the sprouts on the sandwich with ""Giugni Juice"" on the sprouts. Trust me.

Enjoy your trip!","Yes, as someone who isn't a huge fan of his tactical prowess, Lampard gives a hint of being a really good squad builder/planner, Chillwel was his pick (who has been incredible) and he really wanted Auba and a DM, and I reckon these are two players that could have kept him in the job at least till the end of the season.",,"“*rolls eyes*”


Lmfao so cringe. And no Haaland wouldn’t be as shit. He’a clinical asf.","Yeah, they 100% didn't red curcuella, as they refs let things go so their is a potential for more drama, a red there doesn't create any drama as it was the last play of the game anyway

The 1 1 would have sucked but I wouldn't have been this mad. Richalison is 100% offside, but I can understand that isn't always disallowed, but the curcella is a red card and I don't know how VAR can say it isnt. Just mad how it's always fucking Taylor, everytime.",

Difference is when Mourinho did it, it was almost guaranteed to stop the opponents scoring.

With Potter, it just feels like he’s doing it because he’s clueless. His subs are always weird.","Honestly who cares at this point? I was in the same thought, but genuinely I don't see how an interim does any worse. Potter's seemingly given up at this point. Look at that performance today and try and convince me he's doing *any* tactical work whatsoever on the training ground. There's no structure there whatsoever. He's playing the most basic, white bread, easiest to understand 4-2-3-1 imaginable and still seemingly can't get players to understand anything.

Not good enough.,,,,We really can’t judge. It’s his first game and these players are shite.,,,,Honestly it was nice to see someone at least try to move the ball forward though.

Pulisic has been shite for a long time. Ratings will improve if he keeps bringing it",,"Yup you’re exactly the type of fan I’m talking about. Nobody is saying Havertz is an undisputed starter. He has his flaws and should be moved closer to midfield or have a role similar to Muller where he has a bit of freedom and can make use of his technical skill. You’re acting like Havertz is a traditional striker when that’s not his role in the system nor his skill set because that’s not how he played at Leverkeusen. He was put there because he is the closest we have to a striker that Tuchel likes. I actually think Kai would play better in Mounts role where he doesn’t always have his back to goal and can have some more time. I’m bringing up Salah as a way to say that everyone misses chances and has bad touches in crucial moments but somehow that’s makes you think that I’m saying Havertz will be as good as Salah….. nope. That won’t be happening. You fans always have some negative views and that’s my whole point. Havertz isn’t covering himself in glory but you have to praise him for doing the dirty work especially because he was the one pressuring way more once Mount was substituted. Of course we are better off with someone that can score 20 goals it’s stupid not to. But that person was supposed to be Lukaku and it went to shit. There’s nobody available at the moment either. Havertz is what we have now and we will stick with it unless we get Aubameyang (or Broja steps up). Havertz is not blameless nor the solution, but my whole point is he is now the scapegoat regardless of how the cards are stacked against him.",Clear red though yeah,
687,See ETH that’s an actual trust the process appointment  not a divebomb into relegation form.,,Aye,😂,So was Kai,"Only this one? Lol, you're a slow response, aren't you?","Go through my comments history.  I have criticised him plenty and will continue to do so.  Plenty to criticise wrt how he handled last summer, and his lack of patience wrt Tuchel.

Even Roman stuck with Ranieri for a season before identifying his manager for the future, and Roman was known for his quick trigger finger lol.","They're both not really technically gifted on the ball, Gallagher moreso. Mount genuinely is getting a free pass with how he's been playing all season. Also we need to get rid of Auba this window, the guy is so finished and could hardly care less about making an impression either.",,,Had a good impact in the short time he was on. Kepa was decent too tbf,,,Both positions we've just neglected in getting competent backup. It's hilarious how bad we organise this squad.,,,"Literally forgot we have him wow. 

That being said I think Chalobah today has put in the best performance of any of those 3 so far for us",,,,Whatever we paid for him was still too much,,,,"So what you’re saying is, we didn’t concede because our defenders defended well. This is literally how City plays every game, if your defenders are good enough then you do it, because we really should have put 3 or 4 past them down the other end",,,,lol that's who you pick out out of all the players. agenda,"Wasn't that James or was it another instance?

An invasion of the body snatchers thing—he’s someone else now…,,,"He was good first half, he isn’t protected by the refs opposing players know they can foul him all game with no consequences",,,One of them was free and the other one we bought in 2016 and is injured for a 3rd of the season at least.,,,"And we paid 100m for lukaku. 

City paid three cheese slices and half an avocado for Halaand",,,,"He was terrible not doubt.  My probably unpopular opinion is that he at least \*tried\* to do something, even if his execution was awful.  Most of our other players just played lazy passes backwards for the second straight game.",,,,"I mean you can question his choices about his lineup today but let's go easy on calling him Sarri 2.0 just yet.

I certainly saw some ideas that were exciting and a few more that won't probably be repeated going forwards.",,,,"he was the only attack after that round of subs, the entire team was out of ideas at that point. ridiculous that your most active attack starts from a RWB.",Maybe last game but Pulisic undeniably had a solid game today,,You’re acting like criticising Gallagher is unjustified,"the rule regarding VAR is so fucking dumb that you can only have two options though, Red or nothing.

I was extremely hard on kepa during franks era but he’s been really good",,,,"He has to change the system at this point, nothing is working right now, the midfield is nonexistent and leaves the defence exposed.",,,,After how many days exactly? Calm down.,,,,"He was but it’s interesting you single him out when Kai, kovacic, mount, Jorginho, rlc, chilwell, hakim and sterling all played terribly","Hes just below average, but wont single handiley lose us a game like these 2 can",,We won today. Im more interested in taking this time to focus on the positives.

Extend  him, and  give  Jorg the door.",,"Kinda, though.  

Ivanovic was one of the best defenders in the league that season.  
He rarely got beaten on the dribble.  
He passed well.  
He made big runs forward in an era when that wasn't as fashionable.  
He scored a bunch of goals.  
He was a beast in set pieces.  

Truly a great.  

Reece is better, and will keep getting better. No doubt.  I'm 100% on the Reece James bandwagon.

A recipe for a p45.,,,,"People say ""it isn’t the manager"" in response to our endless poor performances, and anyone saying that is correct. We’ve had 3 managers with this group and none of them have been able to get a tune out of them apart from Tuchel in the 20/21 UCL ko rounds.

It doesn't even make sense though, he was balancing work with Ireland (I think) earlier...",,he just seems woefully miscast as a striker to me. his hold up play is worse than sterling’s. i have been neutral on the auba deal but now i really want it because auba in kai’s place and kai in mount’s spot would have made us a much more threatening team.,"I went from having a great weekend, to absolutely fucking fuming. Thanks Anthony Taylor you CUNT",

There was a distinct difference from when cucu was on with a back 3 and when kova came on with a back 4.

I don’t think he’s a bad player overall but he’s so poor up top,How do you expect him to improve players who aren’t good?,,"Mount didn’t make any huge mistakes, should’ve taken the shot instead of playing in Hall in the first half… but Mount was largely invisible relative to Gallagher or even Mudryk and Chuwuemeka (both of which only played part of the second half.)",,,"2 wins in 6 games. Losses to Brighton, Arsenal and Newcastle. Draw with Nottingham. He’s on the hot seat.",,,Not a consistent player in sight. All up and down in form or seriously injury prone.,,,Tuchel’s attack had a plan?  Could have fooled me. Toothless possession isn’t much of a tactical plan in my eyes.,,,,"Todd likely is as well. Honestly, if he’s going to cut Tuchel I hope he does it sooner rather than later so we can avoid having to rebuild and re-learn mid season. Then again, the last time we did that we won the UCL sooooooooo",,,,It’s Potters first game after a week lol,,,,Who is he supposed to give the ball to though. I think he has had enough of the joke tactics he is supposed to play at this point already…,"Good insight, well said. I agree, tactics need to change.",,"i also think kai needs to show up and score, but this is a pretty dumb comparison, come on. haaland has been hyped as literally the best goalscorer since peak ronaldo, kai was never reputed for that. if we played him as a shadow striker i think he’d come good.","We're not close to their level though. It sucks but that's the reality. We need 2 or 3 more really successful windows with players that fit a system and have longevity to develop chemistry before we can think about challenging those two. This year, the target should be top 4 and with performances like that we'll get there. Obviously we won't always turn up but the fact we're capable of today is a real boost to my hopes personally.",

He simply is not, has never been, and never will be a focal point. What he’s best at by far is being the guy that finds the open spaces when the defense is occupied by another player.

That is very natural for a new manager.",,,,I’d like to someone else besides him score,He had the most chances when he was in,,"That’s all great information, and it sounds like you put a lot of energy into figuring all of that out. I doubt doubt any of it. My problem with him is that at chelsea, he just doesn’t pass the eye test. Ok, so he’s not playing his natural position, he likes to arrive late in the box and score 1 touch goals or take a touch and the shoot. I get all that. But he’s out of form, and it’s been obvious for a while. He had an absolutely brilliant chance to score a 1 touch goal against Spurs from 6 yards out, and completely scuffed the chance.  Exact setup you say he thrives in: arrives into the box catching the defenders off guard and a 1 touch shot from close range. Whiff, and it costs us 2 points. Vs Leeds, didn’t even register a single shot registered. Today, not even a single shot. Had a few Vs Everton. His xG and xA are awful in every match. I get he’s not playing in his exact position and exact role, but fuck me, is he really this bad if the entire squad isn’t catered around his exact needs?  So if he’s not a #10 shadow striker with 2 forwards arriving in the box before him so we can swoop in and be the 1 touch goal scorer - what is he offering to the team?",he might as well just take a note from Clattenburg from the Battle at the Bridge,

3.	⁠Start winning and challenge for 1-2 trophy and end the 2023-24 season in top 4
4.	⁠Challenge for every trophy by 2024-25 season.

Issue is there is no identity at all. All the issues are taken care of:

1.	⁠Injuries —> Not so much now
2.	⁠New players that suit his style  —> common now
3.	⁠Time with squad —> we have essentially had a midseason break.

Only thing that I can think of is:

Let me ask you a question, and just know that it isn’t rhetorical at all: did you think Kepa’s form would last forever and he would be our keeper for all or most of this season? 

You can probably guess that my answer is no. Im glad he’s redeemed himself, but Mendy is a much better keeper, even if his form dipped temporarily.

Edit: I think there’s also a psychological element to this. Kepa can get in his own head—we’ve seen it before.

People in this sub, you and I probably included, were calling Mendy the best keeper in the world for a very long period of time (which he was, btw), and just because Kepa has a had a nice run of games that you can count on two hands, everyone pretends he was always the answer and he’s going to be better forever. Mendy is the better player, and I guarantee you and I and 95% of this sub agreed.

Werner and Lukaku being awful gave Havertz a bit of a leeway but now that he has been tasked with leading the line, the spotlight is on him and of course expectations are going to be higher. I’ll agree that Havertz is not playing in his best position, which I genuinely think is somewhat more of a Dele Alli role (when he was good) but that doesn’t excuse his poor touches, lack of end product etc even if he does put in a shift in.

You may do that if you have a casillas, cech, buffon, etc. Out of form because their reputations show evidence of a long standing world class level and they will obviously quickly be back at that level. Neither of our keepers are anywhere near a top class goalkeeper. So, you play them on current form and current form only, as neithers reputation precedes them.

I'd like to point out that mendy had roughly one and a half seasons where he played exceptionally well in his entire career. He has had 6 months+ of dire form. He is no doubt better than a poor kepa, but an in form kepa is no doubt better than a poor firm mendy. So again, you play whichever is in form. The defence looks more comfortable with kepa in goal currently than mendy at the beginning of the season.

If we win 5 games whilst looking crap because of a wonder goal saving us in the last minute, our opposition literally just letting us win due to injuries, laziness and a red card, our opposition missing sitter after sitter and somehow creating shots worth half the expected goals value that xG predicts should be created from those positions, I'm not going to be positive because that luck will run out and we won't get results from playing that way.

Disgusting,,Ziyech was the only forward doing anything in the first half. I honestly didn’t know Mason Mount was playing.,,,[deleted],,,"I really just don't agree tbh. Hindsight is 20/20 but Potter put out what was a very attacking lineup on paper. Havertz, Aubameyang, Sterling, and Mount all started. I think everything else is just an extension of the problems within the squad. Havertz hasn't been in great form but he offers a presence and an ability to hold the ball up that we just don't really have for anyone else. RLC is getting selected consistently in my view because he's versatile and if the 4atb wasn't working how Potter wanted we could have relatively easily switched into a back 3 with Ruben at RWB and Cucurella on the left. I appreciate that he might not have gotten it right based on the result but I don't see Zakaria or Pulisic at the start making a difference. For Pulisic unfortunately all he really provides is dribbling ability but he doesn't tend to drop back and link play and again it locks us into a certain style. You could argue he should have started ahead of Sterling since they're relatively similar but Sterling is pretty clearly the better player on his day. Zakaria is similar in that if he plays, we get locked into a system. If he goes in ahead of RLC then he isn't necessarily proven at the RWB position and if he plays ahead of Jorginho then there's much less control in a double pivot with 3 behind if we end up switching to that. Admittedly I didn't see the Zagreb game because of internet problems but it seems pretty clear to me that he's not as good as we might have hoped purely based on the minutes he's getting.

Waffling now but I don't think it's as simple as people want to make it where we just select players in good form and win the game. I think the lineup was actually relatively astute and we weren't out of the game by any means. Like it or not we aren't on Arsenal's level right now and maybe we just need to accept that and move on from this one.",,,"I can’t believe how quickly this sub forgot about everything that Mendy did for us. He came in and was an immediate and significant upgrade over Kepa. His elite play helped us win the Champions League. And yes, he was a bad for a handful of games, but Kepa has only been good for about as long, and now everyone pretends that Kepa was the answer all along.",,,,I think kova and sterling were also decent broja was mostly invisible,,,,Why do people say this like it wasn't obvious this was a tactical reason and not a player reason? We didn't do counters under this like Tuchel cuz he didn't want us to. We had a ton of fast counters and Kepa held onto the ball a LOT this game when he didn't have a clear counter on.,,,,Quite honestly the mid table teams look better than us,"Because we’re playing the same football we were at the end of last year. I’m glad Bohely and the board decided to back Tuchel. We got him Sterling, and Koulibaly, and Cucurella, and now Fofna and Auba. But this team is still so lifeless. I am regularly questioning his personnel choices and substitutions. It takes going down past the 70th minute for the midfield to start pressing forward. How many through balls did you see today? I think I could count them on one hand. If not for VAR and emergency pressing at the end of the game, today could’ve very easily ended 1-0",,"My question would be what your expectations of him are? Keep in mind that he just turned 23 and is playing out of position. He has time on his side and IMO is adapting better to the league as seen through his better hold up play (although I’ll be the first to point out that it can be better). As fans we give up as soon as the shiny new toy isn’t destroying the league but you have to ask yourself this: what striker has actually been good for us in the last decade? Havertz isn’t the first nor last one that will struggle. I think the problem is that we fans believe that we should be competing with Liverpool and Man City, but that just isn’t going to happen right away. Not because our team is bad but because Klopp and Pep were given time to build their sides. Give Tuchel more time to get players and move Havertz to a better role and he will do much better. Before his move, he was hailed as the next big thing and I still believe he has that potential. But our fans reactions to big money moves that don’t immediately work out are the reason why I am nervous about Fofana. We are paying for potential and Havertz has a ton of it. I’m disappointed with how he can be at times, but I don’t think he should be made the scapegoat","Oh please. He’s shit for England, disappears or injured for half the season.

However, we are struggling to score and lack options that can positively impact the game and force a change by the other team. Perfect example from today is Richarlison, a sub that had immediate impact and forced us to change our approach. Who can we bring to the game that would have similar impact? Pulisic? Ziyech? They too offer energy and no end-product.
At the end of the day, would Kai, Pulisic, or Ziyech start for Spurs? Can they compete with Saka and Jesus in Arsenal? We are not even talking Liverpool and City here (where we belong). Kai (8) + Pulisic (6) +  Ziyech (4) = 18 goals last season.

What on earth has Mudryk done to claim he should be nailed on starter? Part of the reason our fullbacks can't get involved is we have so many attackers just sitting up front.

I think we’re all learning that possession is meaningless unless your players know how to cut through a low block like Pep. We’re not even close to that right now, and the worst thing we could do is keep trying it. Tuchel needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with something that exploits the significant skill gap between our players and mid table players, because right now his system is doing the opposite—it’s leveling the playing field IN FAVOR of worse opponents.","Nope that was me being generous.

The point is they should have been made 15-20 mins earlier to actually impact the match.,,,"Mendy had been incredibly poor since the afcon Cup.

Mendy is not ever going to have a chance of being a top class keeper. Nor is Kepa. I don't care which one plays. Neither have the capacity to be at a level a club of our stature needs. If one shows poor form (being rooted watching shots poor distribution leading to goals, etc.) over a sustained period they should be dropped for the other. Kepa had not made a single mistake of any real value since he's come in. He's also conceded one single goal which he almost made a save of the season contendor on; only just conceding it by mms. He's made 5+ decent saves a match. And a top class save in every match. His distribution has considerably added to the teams comfort and build up. His positioning had stopped at least 4 potential chances (which won't be classed as saves but are just as good if not better). There is absolutely no reason to drop him. There is nothing to improve upon. Its a a risk with no reward. And when he inevitably shits the bed and needs to be dropped he should and mendy will come on and get a chance to prove he's the smarter option.

The only reason to ask for mendy to start now is ""I like mendy"". That's pretty much it. There's no benefit to it at all at the moment and only risk. Hopefully we move on from both goalkeepers at the end of the season and sign one who is at the level of our peers goalkeepers.

We should be simply swapping between the two as their form dictates and squeezing every drop of form out of the two before chucking them away. Neither are good enough to have our full faith or patience in regard to their futures at the club.",,,,sigh! happy birthday tho,,,,Mount came forward and asked to take that corner but Ziyech told him to fuck off.

I agree, none of our forwarders have been decent and consistent enough for us. 

But there’s also some nuance to it. Havertz is being played as a false 9 and he’s not that guy. He’s a CAM who is supposed to roam freely behind a striker. 

Ziyech was rarely utilised the way he was at Ajax and for Morocco, if ever. We can’t expect him to do wonders on LW or RWB lol. 

That one time under Tuchel a few months before the international break, he had a string of matches where he was doing great and being consistent as he started to get used to Tuchel’s system. 

People were saying finally the work was paying off and then after that international break, for some weird ass reason, Tuchel rotated him out of the squad. 

Any minutes he had after that was just crumbs. Players like that don’t thrive in a one way relationship with their clubs. They’re going to check out if relegated to the bench for no reason. 

Pulisic was great for his NT and it was obvious to see why; he was allowed to roam and become a spielmacher as the Germans would say. He’s still somewhat mentally in that role and we can see both him and Ziyech are doing really well, despite the rest of the squad behaving like statues. 

There’s a lot of nuance to be said about Sterling and Auba as well. Point being, the common denominator is the club and it’s management.

No idea why you would put Kai in that group,,,"Not saying we weren’t terrible and have to improve, it’s just annoying playing against the refs every game",,,RLC is fine. He’s been good overall this season. Ineffective game today. J5 just has looked lost in the jungle.,,,Imagine basing someone's intelligence on a typo.,,,,Happy Birthday man.,,,,Come on mate.,,,,"I keep saying this and nobody listens. Tuchel’s system does nothing to exploit the significant skill gap between our players and mid-table/relegation players. If anything, it’s leveling the playing field IN FAVOR of worse opponents simply because it doesn’t utilize our superior speed, dribbling, passing etc.","The goal gets targeted, not the keeper lol. Usually when taking corners, you always avoid putting it near the goal so the keeper cant get it, as they have much higher reach then anyone else, look at the times we had courtois/cech teams would avoid putting crosses anywhere near the them because they'd win 99.9% of the crosses, but now almost every corner is right on mendys head.",,"Of course it matters when we’re talking about the qualities of 1 individual player. We could win and have it be completely independent if 1 specific player plays well or not. We won today and Jorginho and Gallagher played in a 2 man pivot. Are you going to come back to me in 8 months when we’re talking about how Connor can’t play a midfield pivot and explain that because we won today, Connor had a good match?

Must have been in February when Kai had his purple patch of form when he actually decides to look like a professional football player for 4 or 5 matches a year.  According to transfermkt, he had 18 appearances as a #10 last year and scored a whopping 3 goals, 1 in the EFL cup and 1 in the club World Cup. Do you have any other amazing stats that show how good Kai is at his “natural position?”",No chance with the way he went down,
751,"Felix looks great up until the final 3rd. He takes some awful long shots that get blocked far too often when there is a better decision.

But he still deserves to start and does good things out there currently I agree. Pulisic is also about to be back in the fold",,"I'd say he's a Ramires and Meireles hybrid. His quick vertical balls to Kai in the last 2 games have been very very good.

Conor must stay for another year at least. Preferably longer.","Convinced the scouting team saw yt compilations

Our team doesn’t have a striker.","Same thing, just bring him in the team regardless.",
752,"No, Mudryk is limited. Not ready yet.

Mendy has been class ever since he came two seasons ago. Are we going to forget all that simply because of a bad start to the season. We can't be this reactionary.

The fact that you still view Havertz as a striker suggests that you don’t really watch the games or are missing out on how Tuchel’s systems work. How many “strikers” drift wide like Havertz does in other teams?? 

Our team doesn’t have a striker.

We tried the whole striker thing and that didn’t really work out… did it?",[deleted],
753,Agree with every word. Chilwell and James are wing back not full back. Ziyech and RLC never been good enough.,,"Because that's the mentality that you have playing when you're playing for a bad team. ""Any result is good no matter how you get it"" works for players without that top mentality. Winners wouldn't get much confidence from a game like this because there was nothing today that solves any problems we have faced. The other two times we have won in the same way during this awful run it did absolutely nothing for confidence and results went right back to being poor afterwards.

Only playing really well and truly battering a team by multiple goals will give top players confidence.","Read the full sentence. WORTH BUILDING WITH. I’m sure they’re 100’s of managers that would line up for the job, that doesn’t mean they’re worth it. Are there any top managers who want the job. 
You think Zidane, Enrique, etc want this job?","21-22: xG 63.4 Goals scored 76

16-17: xG 61.8 Goals scored 85   
   
We usually finish with better finishing than you would expect. What matters to our team right now is creating good chances. We did that tonight with 21 shots for 2.15 xG. Finishing is highly variable on a game to game basis, but we'll come good eventually. And Posts, goal-line clearances, Soucek hands, and narrow offsides are also part of the story right now.",We don’t have the depth all the players we would play with enzo are injured,,"We are not calling him muddy come on now, mudz maybe",,,"He had one bad run of form lol, he was having personal issues and had changed half the team's players.

It really showed what he’s so good at, and just how antithetical it is to what we ask him to do for us","It was a red though, it was endangering a player maliciously, there was intent to cause harm, any other ref but Taylor and Dean and that's a red",
754, Chilwell and James literally just came back from injury,,"It's an echo chamber of depression rn, much better lol","I said what manager that wants the job is WORTH BUILDING WITH. Boehly doesn’t want high turnover at the manager position, he wants what Liverpool, ManC, and looks like Arsenal have. Long term manager.    
   
Plenty of managers want the job, are they worthy of the job. Mou wouldn’t last, the players won’t want to play that outdated style.

We have more than enough talent to beat these mid-bottom table teams. Tuchel doesn’t know how to do it though. Our attack constantly just looks like they don’t know where or what they are supposed to be doing despite the fact that we have the skill and athleticism to control every game. We are clearly a better team each week that doesn’t have a good game plan. Who’s fault is that?,This is Mendy's real level and it matches up with his performances in france. Last year was the outlier in his carrier. He has regressed to the mean.,,He was very good at moving the ball forwards for Havertz to flub into a Leicester player.,I disagree though - I think you will be surprised.

757,We don’t have many meaningful minutes any longer. Potter saw to that.,,"That's fair, it's three points and that's the important thing for now.","Yeah we were doing great with him. The short memories on you lads. Though I’d take his personality, tell you what",He was good in the first half,"I agree, it’s increasingly looking like his time here is done",,I understand he’s young and got some potentials so should be given time but he was quite poor today,,,"For every Arteta there are many more OGS. Besides, it’s not about resilience, most of us who are Potter’s critics aren’t adverse to the idea of a long term project, we just do not have confidence that Potter is the right man to do it. I would have been perfectly fine for Conte or Tuchel to have a dynasty at Chelsea.",,,"Na wrong take here, Arsenal weren't even good the man of match went to their CB, yet we still made 0 chances because we play Lofty in midfield and Kai every week who isn't contributing. We bring Connor on and had a 5 minute spell because we ran around a bit. 

We are not competing on the pitch at all because of tactics, 4 of the last 5 games we set up wrong from the start",,,,,,,Because?,,,,He was a free kick sent directly in to the wall away from having a full Ziyech game though,,,,"Absolutely agree with you. Players are starting that clearly have no desire to stay. I'd understand Tuchel picking them if there is literally no one else, but there is. He needs to take responsibility, as do the very well paid players, as do the owners to find a solution. I was content this would be a massively transitional season, but this start is worrying me. Sorry to rant in reply, had to let it out and I agree with your point.","I agree both goals were shitty short passes, Mendy could do better, but he shouldn't be under that pressure from our team in the first place, no GK is expecting dog shit like that from their 100m+ back line",,"He's playing in the middle of a front 3. What do you want to call him if he's not a striker? Center forward? No matter how you look at it he should be scoring goals. He doesn't have a goal in 4 games. It's not acceptable. Let someone else take a crack at it. If he's not playing 'striker' like you say then slotting Puli in or Broja or Ziyech once the transfer doesn't go through would be a 1 for 1 swap for someone who is a traditional winger if played in position (Not Broja he is a true striker but w.e you get the point). Couldn't be worse right? He hasn't scored and other players have legs and can make runs. Puli made some great runs in his 30 minute sub appearance against Everton in our first game of the season and looked threatening when receiving the ball in the attacking 3rd. 

If you want me to be completely honest I think TT has a soft spot for his fellow Germans. Timo got a leash the size of Europe last year despite only scoring like 4 times in the PL all season. Kai is getting the same treatment.",Lol,
758,Mudryk looked shit today for the short time he was on. So did Ziyech though. Maybe we should go 4-3-3 and have Felix playing wider (but free-ish) and have someone like Mount/Kova sitting a little deeper as an 8,,We need a striker. We’ve needed one since Costa. You can’t score with CF unless your coach is bald.,"I’m glad they didn’t show the replay. ESPN showed a still right before the boot made contact but haven’t seen anything other than seeing him out cold on the live feed.

We signed new deadwood last summer on huge contracts which will undoubtedly affect the next set of contracts we hand out(eg to Mount). 

We also don’t have any ‘stars’ as such rising through our academy. Doesn’t help that our best players live in an infirmary. I don’t see a world where James is suddenly going to become less injury prone either. 

I don’t really think any of the current youngsters in our side bar James will be world class which I think is also the difference between us and Arsenal. While they were awful, you could see how good Saka and Martinelli could be and Saliba was crazy hyped when he joined them. 

Maybe it’s pessimism idk",,,Man i wanna have what ur having lol,,,,,,,"Under Lampard we would play well, then lose concentration and concede late.

Our attacking performance is every bit as bad if not worse than 2015-2016 when we were 16th.",,,,Tbf barely anyone wanted ziyech to start ever,,,,"Honestly I know its early doors, but the lack of grit is extremely worrying, atleast the end of last season we were shit but over 50% of the team had passion","Both were his fault, second one was also James’ fault. You need to go watch them again, objectively.",,He isn’t… just look at his touch map on whoscored.com,I'm an Arsenal fan so we can at least agree on that,
759,Completely forgot Auba was still on the team. Thought his ass got shipped to MLS,,"These negative people seem to be unable to point to specific aspects of our play that they thought were bad.

We didn’t look like scoring are threatening to Arsenal today at all, players like Havertz, Mount, Auba and RLC are a disgrace to the club and I won’t take it back.

Havertz: decision making and execution in the final third is championship level or worse.

Auba: is a complete poacher now, without creativity next to him he’s shit.

Mount: he can’t dribble, lack vision or shoot, only good at running away from the ball which we seen today. OPTA invisible!

Cucu: I’m not even sure what he’s good at, every time we boom forward he’s nowhere to be seen always stuck way behind for the pass.

RLC: he’s just horrible at midfield! He should be playing wingback nothing more. He lacks everything you need Freon your midfielders.",,,,,,,"Sounds suspiciously like Lukaku.

Cucurella and Koulibaly have also done similar.",,,,And they were all shit.,,,,"Spot on. Agree with everything you said. I think at this point Tuchel needs to settle a bit more on a definite plan for the way we play and how he will use his squad and start building back some consistency, tighter combinations, tighter positional play. That will bring back more control and security to games. Not panicking yet but the clock is ticking.",How is the first goal not his fault? He tries to punch away the ball about gets nothing on it which leaves r goal completely free for Rice to square it and Antonio to tap it in.

All the pundits will give Potter every excuse that they didn’t afford Tuchel.",,,,,,,We start with the coach tailoring the system to our players instead of plugging players into his system.,,,,"And two of them, the header and the volley, were terrible attempts.

Rather have Broja, Mount and James' narrowly off-target efforts than those 'shots on target' that wouldn't have gone in even if my nan was in goal.",,,,"Agreed, the players have given up on Tuchel, its clear as day to me, seen it too many times.

Definitely a lot of potential but didn't showcase that this afternoon.",,,It isn't inevitable. Potter was hired to lead the club through a rebuild.

By replacing them",,,,"No it was for sure a lack of finishing, especially in the 2nd half. First half Salzburg had a lot of good defensive shut downs and blocks. Second half we missed at least 3 goals from poor finishing -- Ziyech goal that should have been a given, Broja hit the ball off his shin instead of his foot, Reece's goal went right over the bar, etc.",,,,"That's because he puts in 30% workrate,  hence his partner every game is injured lmao","I agree, but cucú has been better than a bunch of people with little time",,,"I agree, but we missed 3 or 4 of them, not just 1. The havertz one was the standout of course. 2 games into the season and our attackers look like they have the same goal scoring problem. I love what sterling adds to the team, but he kind of has a finishing problem too.

I wouldn't be concerned if it wasn't already a problem from last season",
762,"Tbf, the signings are all probably worth about 200m on paper. All young, no experience, no Prem experience, no leaders or club captains.

Carney was fucking disgusting today,,,How many first team players did Potter sign,,,Even Tuchel never lose back to back pl game,,,,,,,Ziyech was more of a RW and James RB than anything else.

For the vast majority of that time chelsea controlled them fairly well.","Potter doesn’t deserve a free ride but some of OPs points aren’t wrong. We definitely came out firing after the half but the ball just wouldn’t find its way in the net and was pinballing around endlessly in our box.

For more ""recent"" performances, Pulisi was [fouled 11 times](https://sports.yahoo.com/christian-pulisic-usmnt-exit-world-182825854.html#:~:text=We%20deserved%20more%20at%20this,11%20times%20in%20315%20minutes.) in the 4 games he played. For context, Messi was awarded 22 fouls (found a few stats for his number, some said 19, some said 22). It's also worth noting that Pulisic is so frequently fouled in CONCACAF, that it's honestly somewhat painful to watch. The games against Mexico are notoriously dirty, and he tends to receive the greatest amount of punishment.

As for this season specifically, Tuchel basically didn't play him (and others) due to what seems to be stubbornness.

The hope is obviously that Zakaria finds form and becomes our anchor in midfield that allows this kind of play style without us being completely open defensively every time we lose the ball


I think Koulibaly will take time, LCB in a three is very different to LCB in a 4. You face defensive work that you'd normally only face as a LB and that's very different and something Tuchel actually mentioned very early on in pre-season about Koulibaly, he was never meant to play as a wide CB, he's only ended up there because we failed to get Tuchel's defensive targets.

They have a system, everyone knows their roles and every single one of them is shining as a result. Its isn't some pure coincidence that they have the most in form CBs, fullbacks, midfielders, forwards etc. If you took one Arsenal player and swapped them with a Chelsea player there's a good chance the Arsenal paper would ""do nothing"" like people have been criticising Havertz and Mount for.

A different play is defined as a period where the ball goes back to a position in which the entire defence can reset their positions, this doesn't happen here.

Boehly was stupid to sack TT mid-season, it would have made more sense to do it before the season began.

I know we are frustrated but let’s not pretend it was roses and trees were green under TT. And saying appointing Potter was a mistake. It’s a mistake sacking TT but appointing Potter? No, it’s too early to judge.

Defensively we also massively need cover which hopefully Fofana will be able to provide and give us options in terms of formation.  If you look at the way City played against West Ham they were unstoppable, I didn't see the game yesterday but the highlights looked similar.

He needs to go, this is his 3rd season and he is still not consistent for us. Jorginho is too slow and too weak for our midfield if we want to challenge top 4 and maybe go for a title challenge.

Thiago Silva is finshed, he cost us the game today with mistakes, he cost us the game against Brighton with his mistakes. He is past it. He is making these mistakes more consistently, and that is a worrying sign. It typically means a centreback has lost that special touch, especially when they are 38+

Cucurella signing still makes no sense, we splashed out £64m on a backup left back when we desperately needed a goalscoring striker ? It was an impulse buy, we had Emerson at the club who we could have used as a back up left back who was more than good enough.

I would take back Higuain, Lukaku, Morata, Ba, Torres, Eto'o, literally any other striker in a heartbeat over Auba. Auba offers us absolutely nothing whatsoever.

Potter has inherited a very broken squad, has none of his own players and is trying to patch something together (most of these players bought by Tuchel who everyone circlejerks over, Auba is working out great!).

Potter  has proven himself at every team prior to Chelsea, given time and his own players I'm sure he'll turn things around at least let's give him a chance.

Saying most of the people here are up for a rebuild is absolute shite, it's just a bunch of nobs who know very little about football spewing hate as they don't like their own lives :).

With players like Felix, Mudryk and a proper 9, I would expect more from him, same can be said for all our attackers tbh.

I was downvoted ferociously when i said tuchel out over the weekend by tuchelsexuals and folks with attachment issues to him. 

Square pegs in round holes. We’re trying to force a “build” like klopp and pep did…but the only difference is, their squads were improving year after year. 

We aren’t.

City were down twice this season. 3-1 against newcastle and 2-0 against palace. 3-3 and 4-2 respectively.

3-0 to leeds and 2-1 to southampton. No fight back, no mentality, no respect for the coach.

Players fear/respect/admire pep and klopp. No one fears tuchel nor respect him in our locker room imo.","I think he’s been below average but a bad game for him is automatically a 0/10 around here. That’s more of my beef.  It’s the polarity that we judge him that bugs me.

I think he’d be a good squad player. The problem is that you have one end that think he’s the American Lebron and the others that think he’s absolute trash.

Of course, being a squad player is obviously not going to work long term. But it’s a realistic position for him on the current squad.",,,"Yeah, Richarlison being offside",

They were in our box plenty, I don’t know how you can possibly say we controlled them well after the first round of subs","Tuchel also signed Lukaku, Sterling and a bunch of defenders.

You can tell Ziyech doesn't care and is probably as surprised as we are about being included today.",,,,we're not beating arsenal or united lol,,,,"I think a clear distinction needs to be made between keeping faith with a bunch of attackers when they've looked clueless with zero end product and results, compared to presevering with those who've actually looked like combining or doing something upfront. Only sterling deserves a consistent run and looks like somewhat of a threat, but even he dropped off badly in the second half. For all the criticism being hurled at ziyech,he created 2 clear chances today which havertz predictably fuffed. One was that long range pass which set him off for a 1 v 1, it wasn't easy , fair enough but the pinpoint cross he absolutely needed to put away. I swear if we still had ramires, tuchel would make him part of the front three because he runs and presses a lot. 

When we question which of our attacking players have actually improved under him, that's where the cracks really start to show. Because right now I've only got mount, and even then you could argue his upward trajectory was always gonna result in impressive numbers. Doesn't change the fact that I still believe he's not being played in his best position though. 

Now, who else? Lukaku, Werner, CHO, Pulisic, Ziyech, have all been deemed not good enough and are actually regressing / regressed. Various players who've performed to a high standard under different managers. All going backwards. It's no coincidence. Combine this with his insistence on starting only his favourites, and you have a recipe for disaster which is unfolding right before our eyes.","Ah yeah you're right, they hit the post from Jorginho losing possession.",,,"Yh, when you win by a bs ref decision, I take the win, but it feels wrong inside, y’know",

We've already got 2 slow mids, granted he's far and away better quality than both Jorginho and RLC, what we really need is a Box to Box type. When Kante is playing that role we look a lot better, but it's not quite his bag. Partey wasn't quite box to box because we didn't force him to be, but he played that role and does play it a lot, and he tore us to shreds.

Nicolo Barela is the best out there, he'd cost 60-80 for sure but he'd transform our midfield overnight. Barela has great quality with the ball at his feet too, this would allow Kante to focus more of the defensive role rather than tear-assing around the pitch and getting injured like he does now.

Kante & Barela with Galagher, Mount or Kai playing a pure 8 or even Mount or Kai as a 10... now THAT's a midfield. Even RLC/Jorginho/Zakaria would be able to fill in for Kante more often without having to worry about them because they wouldn't be doing that extra leg work.

Just my opinion",,,,,,,Yep as shown by the always changing centre midfield. Today- mount and Kov never done before.

The problem is we have too many weak or low impact players on one team, and a manager who isn’t getting anything special or extra out them. Neither was TT.

Our best midfielder (Kova) is absolutely lethal to our attack when he is involved. I’m picking on Kova because that’s how poor our squad is and how bad they play together, and he is supposed to one of the best players in this club.

For what it’s worth, even if the players were amazing, he still reached finals and won trophies, so he did the job.","It happens all game, every game, but it’s more visually obvious when he’s playing on the side closest to the TV cameras, which against Dortmund was the first half. Watch him and not the ball when we’re trying to build up from the back and you’ll see him positioning himself so his marker is between himself and the ball many, many times and he doesn’t actively move to find the space to make himself available for his teammates. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it, and when you get to watch someone like Enzo, or Kovacic, or even Jorginho, or Kante play the same pivot role it gets all the more obvious that he’s not doing what everyone else is doing in that role. 

Besides, the building up from the back problems he’s also very lackadaisical with his off the ball movement when the ball is on the other wing. You’ll see him walking around much too deep relative to where the ball is, which again puts him in a position where the passing lanes to him are cut off, yet he has acres of space in front of him he could have run in to to make himself available to his teammates on the left. That forces players like Enzo to either recycle the ball back to the LCB or try much more risky passes forward instead of the simpler and more productive lateral switch of play to his pivot partner. 

I find it maddening to watch and I cannot wait until Kova and Zakaria are back, and eventually Kante too. At that point, RLC won’t need to play anymore, at least not as one of the pivots.

What about Dortmund? Mid-table manager that everyone rates? Watch much football?,,,Yeah exactly. It just felt like the same story with Tuchel with short term success. But he wasn’t fully backed with a proper scouting team… his interests were questionable but that’s not his job and he really just wanted to coach. Sad he overachieved making us believe some of our players are better than they are. I hope potter does well here regardless because it’s still chelsea football club over the players or managers.

Guardiola won the league in his second season and in that time he drilled his style of play into the team, tuchel has been here 2.5 years and still it's Reece James and inshallah, our most threatening players are defenders and jorginho because there's 0 focus on the front 3, this excuse of no striker is BS at this point, if auba fails(hopefully not) then tuchel has no excuse because these performances are acts of terrorism",,,,

We’re defo missing a defensive midfielder - someone to breakup play and anticipate dangerous sitUations. That’s clear.


Enzo and a not fully fit/up to speed Kova does not give the defence enough protection, especially when we’re missing James.


And I do agree that at times our rest defense structure is too open but that’s something that will be worked on.


Write off the season up to the end of January. That was about assessing the players and seeing what was needed. We also had all our best players injured.


Potter is working with a new team since the last few games so judge him from then. How can a new team be perfect from the beginning?","I don't know man. I feel like Ziyech was instructed to drop back deep when they have the ball and defend alongside reece which he did. He was linking up well with Joao and Havertz throughout. Once mount was introduced, he was probably instructed to hug the right side to open up spaces in the middle. All in all, I don't think Ziyech's positioning was the issue this game.

For me, that indecisiveness, players looking like they don’t know where each other are GOING TO BE, and having trouble defending set pieces are 3 of the biggest red flags that something is wrong with a teams coaching/training.

I’m not saying sack Tuchel, especially since we’re letting him try to build a team in his image. It would be shambolic to spend as much as we did on a managers specific targets then sack him (reminds me of Everton selling Digne specifically because he didn’t get along with Rafa then sacking Rafa 3 days later)

I truly believe the vision and direction of the club has become apparent. Hopefully we can fix the poor summer signings along with Lukaku because those have messed up the wage structure.

What defensive structure?  We are defending with a back 2 and throwing everyone forward praying for a goal.  The gamble is the opposition is too shit to capitalise on all the space we give them.

When we keep a defensive structure, we cant create for shit because our players are tied to this shit rigid positional system that doesnt allow them to create natural overloads down either wing.

Also, we cant press so we dont win the ball high up the pitch to create easy opportunities.  We sit in our defensive shape but we dont counter with any speed instead choosing to slow the play down for this shit build up system.

The season is a write-off the longer this PE teacher is kn the dugout.  Football isnt as hard as he makes it look.  It took him 70 minutes + 10 minutes injury break to figure out we need an extra body at either CB or midfield.  Its actually embarrasing.

No need to say this. And this isn't a Tuchel vs Potter discussion. All I'm saying is that compared to September, the team has gotten better on paper. Doesn't matter if Tuchel also had players who we spent massive money on that weren't worth it. Lukaku did not fit the system, Cucurella was not worth 60M, KK was shaky under Tuchel and is still shaky now, Auba played like 1 or 2 games under Tuchel, Sterling is still playing now so I'll give you that. 

Under the old regime, we had suspect scouting and transfers, but all that has changed with the new directors coming in. Badiashile maybe costed less than KK and Fofana, but look how he integrated quickly into our starting II. That's good scouting. Felix and Enzo (which we both agree on) would have drastically improved Tuchel's team as well.

he only player who improved at Chelsea after Tuchel left is Kepa and maybe Ziyech. Everyone else has looked either the same or worst. There's no system in place. All we have is Enzo and Felix trying to create something out of nothing.

The players that were seemingly bad under Tuchel are still bad now that's why (i.e. KK, Cucurella, Pulisic). And those that were good, are either still good or have regressed (RJ still good, Silva still good). Now that can be down to the team as a whole regressing, but that just shows that there hasn't been any improvement under Potter.

That just goes to show you how no-one is actually living up to their potential and I find that suspicious as well. But people are delusional if they think Fofana and Auba or anyone for that matter is going to magically make us better. Tuchel has been found out in the 2nd half of last season and any decent strategist knows how to neutralise his tactics. That’s fine if you’re not stubborn and willing to adapt, but he isn’t. Morale now is as low as it can be with players losing respect for their manager. You could really see it in their body language today. TT will either go back to the drawing board and make iterations or he will be sacked before our December curse starts.","I mean, part of what makes me think about it, is looking at Giroud with Puli. The connected well, and you could see where Puli's speed and runs opened space for Giroud, and where Girouds experience let me see the runs of Puli.

Havertz, Mount, Ziyech, Broja, etc are all good and have there strengths, but throughout all of the last few years it's been obvious that they usually missed the runs.

Reece sees the runs, but it can't be a ball in from only him everything.

907,Next 48 hours usually,,,"Emery was at the club until 29th November, which puts them in 8th place. Ljungburg was then interim manager until 20th December when Arteta came in which does put them in 10th place.

The fact that Arteta's named headed the sack race for most of the season is clear as day that there were issues at Arsenal and the board had some faith in him as a long term project.

I'm not saying that Potter is absolved of any of the issue and the current situation but if you're only giving him four months where he's had a squad that's been flipped on it's head with signings (whether they're his choice or not remains to be seen), a World Cup break where half the squad wasn't even in the country and an injury crisis then I just think that's unfair. 

I'm not using those reasons as excuses (because they're not) but they are absolutely contributing factors that the club, not just the manager, has had to deal with. I think it's a reasonable assumption to say that if Tuchel was still at the club and experienced those reasons he'd be in a similar position.","Two shit balls into the box.

No, that's not right. It doesn't assume anything. It just is a calculation of numerous shot situations to determine an expected goal for the situation. By utilizing a large data set, it uses both good, bad, and every other type of finisher.

Bad finishers will pull down the average, good finishers would push it up. It doesn't just guess which is which.

Let me try this again. Expected goals tell you a few things, your point is one of them, but you are ignoring the other situations it can describe. You are stating: below average = bad finisher.

Yes, that could be true, but you are missing the factor of time. If a player that has had a xG above or around average over their 5 year career,  then had a half season of well below xG, you could come to the conclusion that the player is in a dry spell. 

Yes, you could be right that they are just bad finishers, but you are ignoring the fact that most of the same attacking team ended the 2021/2022 season at a +6.70 expected goals. Having a -6 in a short timeframe could be determined as unlucky and an outlier.

Nope, I explained it to the other commenter. I'll summarize:

xG could mean good or bad finisher, but that would need to be determined over time. A player with usually a high or above average finishing could just be unlucky if the timeframe that is being calculated is small.

Chelsea ended the 21/22 season at +6. Chelsea was -0.10 for this season before January 1st. Chelsea is currently -6.7 1 month later.

This could be read as ""bad finishers"" or ""unlucky."" By looking at it this way, with similar players, it could lean towards unlucky.",Mo you git it wrong he said he can play anywhere across the attack. What a multi-dimensional player.! /s,,"Looking at those stats now on WhoScored.

If you can’t recognize good cf play without goals then there’s nothing to discuss. He was unlucky not to have a goal, went woodwork, created a chance by himself, and did his best to try and get on the end of the mount cross at full stretch.

What service did he have? The one real chance he had there were 2 defenders marking the goal, and the keeper rushing at him and he lobbed it over and hit the inside of the post. That’s unlucky this isn’t fifa. 

It’s not like crosses were flying in at him all match and he couldn’t finish, or there were through balls that he wasn’t making the run for. And it’s not like anyone (literally anyone) else on the team provided any threat whatsoever.

I’m just saying I don’t think starting broja over him or any other striker we could realistically get makes the team play any better.

Tuchel has said we play a back 5 because of Jorginhos limitations. Unfortunately he’s the only one who can stay healthy so we don’t have much of a choice. Subsequently, I think the play is forced wide to the wingbacks to an especially high degree because if we do lose the ball in the middle we’re so vulnerable not having anyone with the legs to deal with it. We just get run over on the counter.",,,,,
984,You’re delusional,,,,,"Nah, you just have to throw more Money at the pitch, some day its going to pay of.",,,,,,,,"Oh for sure I agree. I think the quality is part of the problem though. Every manager goes ""Well we have 3 fantastic midfielders, why would I need more"". And so we don't add the profile of midfielder we need. Especially because I imagine all 3 want to play every match.

The problem there is we didn't keep academy kids, and then on top of that decided to keep Azpi. I love the guy but atm he can't lace Reece's shoes. We need a more high agility/speed guy at that area. We saw against Arsenal he was scared to go forward. That's really f'ed us tbh.",,,,,,,Zero big chances created,,,,"Can't score if you pass straight to the keeper either.

There's a reason good finishers aim for the corners rather than just trying to put something on target...",,,,Reddit is actually the one who taught me that Jorginho controls tempo and dictates football games. He's like Professor X from X-Men but a real footballing version.,,,,,
985,">We've had years of inconsistency since 2010, arguably since Mourinho's first sacking.

In the last 10 years only city won more pl titles then us.

Why? We have our worst form in over 20 years. Have 5 goals since christmas.

>If you started following Chelsea post-2000s (that includes me) I think you need to take a step back and realise how top clubs like City/Liverpool/Real/Bayern have thrived off stability while we've been chopping and changing to nick the odd title and European trophy.

Real madrid stable?go look at their coach history in the last 10 years lol.

Its good to preach stability but at some point you gotta get results that warrants that stability. Lets take lfc for example since you brung them up, in 2014 brendan rodgers brought them 2nd in a very tight title race. The next year he finishes 6th or 7th and 15-16 season he started really poor and got sacked for klopp. You see this? Theres a standard that need to be kept its all good to want a project and all that if we were 5th or 6th wnd seen patterns of play I wouldve said ok give him some time but we are getting worse every week.  We have 2 wins in 16 games.",,,,,We are shocking,,,,,,,,Mount! You mean our player of the year the last two seasons? And Gallagher isn’t means to be first team quality yet he’s a young squad player with potential they’re not meant to be starting 11 quality yet that’s kinda the point of them,,,,,,,"Said this in the daily.

Ziyech tried many things but was shit at all of them.

Mount was just a ghost.

I'm not sure which is worse",,,,The one where the keeper got a very lucky save with his foot that if Ziyech put any power or lift behind the shot the keeper wouldn't have gotten to.,,,,Clueless,,,,,
986,"Nobody is arguing that they don't want stability or believe in a long-term project.

The point is Potter is clearly not up to the task and the team is getting more and more damaged beyond repair.

No player is going to sign for us as they will just kill their career, no manager is going to want to come and fix the mess.

This is a serious crisis, if we get the same points in the next 15 as the last 15, then we will be relegated without a doubt. This group of players has the ability to be in the top 4, the problem is how they're playing together, and that falls on the manager.

Stability is all well and good, but being stable with a coach with zero idea is just straight up lunacy!",,,,,"Everyone saying “if you get rid of potter who would we even hire?” How about any fucking manager we go against who outclasses him? He’s not even mediocre, he’s fucking bad.",,,,,,,,Combining alonso with your username is hilarious...,,,,,,,The people responsible for spending that trillion on wrong players,,,,That seems about average no?,,,,"You are comparing putting a keeper and a 38 year old CB at wing back to a young, pacy WINGer at WINGback. The problem here is not the defending side, anyone could give him benefit of the doubt for that. The problem here is he's shit at the winger bit, the bit he should be good at.",,,,,
987,Agreed 100%.,,,,,"They had 500m+to spent în 2 windows and the only good transfers were the youngsters, enzo and mudryk....",,,,,,,,Yeah but we got the wrong players.

Why did you pick Mendy 😂,,,,,
988,Because he made a lot of bad decisions? Sacking Tuchel (a fan favourite) after spending quite a lot of money on his targets. Also giving Potter a 5 year deal with an insane pay rise for no apparent reason. And now he refuses to get rid of the guy even though we are sinking deeper and deeper. I don't hate the owner but he should get a lot of criticism.,,,,,I would've preferred playing Chalobah or even Reece there... This manager does not have the bollocks to drop Mount.,,,,,,,,"We aren't talking about who is the most prestigious coach, but who is better right now, tactically for the most part. and if you wanna judge who is the better coach in this superficial way, then tell me what did you think when Chelsea skinned Madrid and Carlo only made it out due to Kante making two mistakes? It's a superficial way to look at things but you seem content using it.

I don't think Carlo takes our team and wins a CL with them, and I don't think he would have achieved as good results as Tuchel did with this current iteration.

Both are top coaches but I rate Tuchel higher than Carlo right now, but to each their own, peace.",,,,,,,Did the attack have more structure at Dortmund?,,,,"I really don't think mount is to blame for that, but each to their own I guess.",,,,No fair enough. I was asking a genuine question. Just wondered where you thought.,,,,,
989,"Honestly, I think it's because he's American. Maybe that's my American bias showing, but I feel like the distrust of him started from the very beginning. The 4-4-3 thing (which I'm convinced was just a slip off the tongue or accidently losing count when rattling off our best xi etc), constantly focusing on his lack of soccer background (as though Roman grew up in our academy) and just the overall hyperfocus on pulisic when he's neither the problem nor savior.

If this dude was just a randomly rich European, they'd love him but admit he probably made a mistake with potter. But no, he's Elon musk 2.0, Ann egotistical maniac who's obsessed with what's said about him on the internet and who would rather burn it all down than admit a mistake. And musk isn't even American!",,,,,"He's had a team which has had 0 time to settle because of injuries. You guys think just bringing in even more players will help? Bizarre. Give it a couple of weeks, think we'll look better.",,,,,,,,"What?


RLC was the deepest midfielder at times and clearly tasked with helping out azpi down the left side.

Mount was the link between attack and defence  surely?",,,,,,,">At this rate, the Roman era of hiring and firing managers makes more sense and more effective than the 'lets build a clear football philosophy ' bullshit. 

This rate being City winning 4 of the last 5 titles and on their way to 5/6 by building a clear footballing philosophy?",,,,Oh god it’s Ole v2 isn’t it,,,,"no confidence, no run, stuck in a poor attacking formation. First half players benefitted from the back 4 for maybe 5 minutes and then went back to being horrible.

You can't really believe that is the best from him? He's shown he can do much better even tho he is inconsistent. He's not in a good way right now in the team and I am sure his confidence is at an all time low. Sterling was honestly giving it away at a very similar rate.",,,,,

Also, those of us that have watched Chelsea for many years have seen this all before. Sacking world class managers for the ""next big up-and-coming thing"" isn't a new concept, and it virtually always isn't as productive as world class managers tend to be. There's a reason people like Tuchel and Conte are where they are on the world stage and we threw that away for no reason.",,,,,,,sorry thought this was the 0-10 ratings survey,,,,"Exactly, in that game, everything that could go wrong for him, did go wrong, incredible in a different sense really.",,,,"Tammy I guess?

My entire dissatisfaction is from the fact that we had a world class manager that loved the club and the fans loved and we sacked him for Boehlys selfish work-life happiness, then spun a web of PR to blame Tuchel for it and a lot of fans here lapped it up. We're in the situation - whether an optimistic or doomed one - because of Todd Boehly alone and that's totally ignored because of the public slander of Tuchel after he was unfairly sacked. The whole thing is sour and made even sourer because there are A LOT of people who have convinced themselves it had to happen because Boehly told them so.",,,,,,,You're blaming Boehly for losing??,,,,Spurs game was best performance of the season but we still had the same issues creating shots.

I’ve noticed and criticized it for a long time. I don’t care if we play 5 or 4 at the back but we need to utilize build up plays in the middle.

-We still lack a lot of quality to play counter football. Yes you'll get a few goals off hoofs and second balls, but the majority of transitions will end once it gets to the second phase of build up and someone takes 6 touches to overhit a through ball

-Counter football isn't enough to win anything. Regardless of what you play, some teams will just insist on a low block.

996,"Same, same. I supported him but today was just too terrible. Clueless, abysmal, just too poor. There's no process here, no progress just regression. He has to go!",,,,,He did that months ago. You need more than 1 good striker and it's clear Aubameyang won't be used and Kai is pure trash...why you didn't sell off 1 or both them and bring in a proper one now is beyond me.,,,,,,,,RLC is poor almost every time he plays. He brings nothing into the team other than filling up a spot,,,,,,,I’ll take all x2,,,,"They had 10 men behind the ball, of course they did.",,,,"He needs a run of games. Just like how kai, mason, sterling get. In these 5 games he’s come on at the end of each game. When he’s gotten the most playing time we’re already losing and the team is already defeated. It’s hard to make an impact at that point in the game, and on top of that when you’re obviously not trusted by the manager. I was shocked that Ziyech started today over him. 

The same goes for gilmour, ampadu, chukwuemeka, broja. You see how bad the teams consistently playing and still you can’t get any minutes?",,,,,
997,Needs go before Dortmund wtf,,,,,last quarter of the game he looked very average,,,,,,,,Right. I never said he wasn’t poor,,,,,,,We're really blaming Ziyech alone for the disasterclass from the whole team huh.,,,,At least not winning the game isn’t as frustrating as it used to be,,,,"Of course not, we've seen better from him. At his peak he could have been a nailed-on starter for me. But not in a long time. I'm starting to doubt if we'll see it again. 

Sterling was poor at times, but football is a game of calculated risks. Many of his giveaways were unsuccessful take-ons that would have given us numerical superiority in the opposition 18. Puli was giving the ball away dribbling to nowhere today",,,,,

There's a reason we want their dof.,,,,"IT is his position thought. Playing LWB and playing LW put you in the same position when attacking on the pitch. That puts him out wide.

We just look utter shit, we had two weeks to prepare for this game and we play like this aswell ? We cant complain about a lack of preperation. When you watch us play do you have any feeling that this team is moving in the right direction or just stagnated or even regressing ?

This team has been together now for 8 months, and we still havent seen any progression at all, we have just gotten worse and worse since Potter first took over. We started so bright with Potter then we just have regressed ever since.",,,,,,,,Exactly what I'm saying.

There's still time.",,,,"I mean, I understand your point, but you don't have the same starting point, you have to have in the back of your head your defensive responsibilities, and I think you have different looks in terms of supporting players around you.

Regardless, you are still missing my point that he has zero chance to get in a rhythm or gain confidence, and I still think pulisic would have had more success in the first half when it was more free flowing and we had more attackers forward with 4atb. But his biggest problem is lack of run/rhythm, which players that take on men dribbling need.

Reece was not doing the dribbling he is doing this year until he started scoring all those goals last year, he has gotta be one of the most confident players in the world right now",,,,,

I agree his reaction to transfers was a little overdone but not exceedingly,,,,"Put Pulisic in Mounts granted spot every game this season and I guarantee we have a larger goal output but Tuchel has completely mis managed the player in this situation and he's now completely lost confidence. 

Not once did Mount act brave or find a half space when he was supposed to be our main creative outlet.  Shit on Pulisic all they want but at least he's one person brave enough to take players on besides Sterling and of course Tuchel exclusively plays Pulisic on the right which is his worse side.

It’s just coming into fruition now.",,,,,,,"> Unless we stop this crowding the opponent defence tactic, and become dynamic, we are not scoring any goals

That's exactly right.  We are having a ***tactical*** problem, and that is a problem with the manager, not players.  There is far too much space between the two pivots and the forward line, and when forward players do drop in to get the ball, no one is making a run off that run to create space and pull defenders out of position.

Potter is only comparable to Pep. They both joined with top 4 quality teams (Klopp and Arteta joined to 8th~ quality teams) and then could spend any amount of money they wanted to improve the team.

He never does. It just gets attributed to him because of his stans constantly spewing it.  He was nowhere near at the level of Kova, and I feel sorry for Mount because he could only get the ball from RJ as Jorgi doesn't play forward.  He just has a fancy name and people think he's  good on the ball. He blazed it to Tiago Silva in the air in our own penalty box, he clearly lacks composure and passing technique.",,,,,,,,,

Instead of wasting energy discussing Tuchel’s irrelevance, I’d rather discuss our current state of affairs.  Which in my opinion is not a result of Potter being here for 12 matches, lmao.

If the manager doesnt think a player fits in their plans, should drop then and find someone who can do the job. So far Tuchel and Potter have sucked at figuring that part out and committing to it.

We play the slowest, most insipid football every match. Recycling possession for possession's sake. Passes to feet every time, zero urgency, poor shape in defence and attack, no presence in midfield when in possession.

1032,"That’s only because the Football League didn’t break for the World Cup, so only the PL teams have played so few games. Mind you the fewest goals in the PL is still a mad stat",,,,,"What?

I wish I had your optimism, but that's just silly.",,,,,,,,That was literally the buzz word you used,,,,,,,"Maybe if you create a culture where everyone is afraid of making a wrong foot, they end up playing like this. Tuchel blows",,,,"Lol, no way you think 7 points is going to be enough here. 9 might be if the other results go out way, but 7 is way too ambitious. Might end with Europa there.",,,,,,,,,
1033,"You got any source for that? Not that I don't believe you, I absolutely do. But it's so baffling I need to see it. 3 goals in 10 :>",,,,,Lol people act like potter came in and suddenly we were shit. Been this way for a long time. Same under tuchel and still the same now.,,,,,,,,i mean a lot of people on this sub still feel we have elite players in midfield,,,,,,,"I really just don't understand how you can include pulisic in this coming on at the 75th minute with a majority of it being time wasting. That's what you single out? A bad header and bad touch? Out of the entire game. 

Secondly, you can't blame tuchel? The fuck? For selecting a run down sterling? For playing an awful midfield with zero defensive discipline in mount and kovacic? For playing Auba when he is clearly not ready? For our entire team consistently underperforming? For having zero answer for an unknown croatian side on both sides of the ball?",,,,"I'll be trying not to in the future, imagine picking mount as the person to complain about from that match lol.",,,,,,,,,
1034,Who did you think will actually score our next goal if it ever happens? Feels like Kepa has as much goal threat as anyone else at the minute,,,,,"That's not true, it's imagined, it's not real. 


In the 18 games we played in the league from January onwards we scored 33 goals. (1.8 goals per game)



Since Potter took over in the league we've scored 14 goals in 15 games. (0.9 goals per game) 



We dropped off from our normal level at the start of last year. But, our attack was still twice as good as we have been under Potter.",,,,,,,,"I understand in the context of this game but every time we play Jorginho and kova together , we keep plenty of possession and create hardly anything unless we have opponents like Salzburg, it’s always Jorginho with his sideways passes and kova with his 100 overhit or underhit passes per match.",,,,,,,"Ziyech just had one of his worst games in years and Pulisic had 15 minutes where he largely added nothing, similar to most of the squad. How those two are getting lumped in together are mind blowing. The obsession with shitting on him is getting just as weird and obnoxious as the American favoritism at this point.",,,,Caught ball watching. Major no no as a defender in any sport,,,,,,,,,
1035,In the last 3 games when we re-hire Tuchel.,,,,,You think we had a worse team than Fulham out there?,,,,,,,,Fair enough,,,,,,,"You’re correct, we just need to give Tuchel another £200m to spend and we might even sneak a top 6 finish in the league",,,,Wonder what it’s like to be a miserable cunt all the time,,,,,,,,,
1036,There’s absolutely no chance we’re relegated,,,,,"A 9 point difference? Come now, we've seen those disappear in 3 games.",,,,,,,,"Mount spent half the game drifting wide left as there was very little width otherwise. Definitely not what I would consider his preferred role.

Ability to play out from the back was dreadful which I blame on the manager more than the players, feel like that handicapped the entire midfield/attack, Mount included. 

Hopefully things turn around as I think a lot more can be done with this squad even with the injuries.",,,,,,,"this also goes down to man management.
Tuchel has continually played Havertz and Mount in a side that cannot create.
Playing 3atb against a side that is 100% parking the bus.
Why is it a common theme that werner, pulisic and ziyech all want to leave? Cos of his constant favouritism for under performing players. No accountability whatsoever.",,,,Bc you haven’t mentioned anyone else being ass? Mount has been awful for far more minutes than puli this year has he not?,,,,,,,,,
1037,"Trust the process, the sacking process",,,,,Yeah i felt a bit foolish typing that,,,,,,,,"Playing in a preferred role doesn't mean much if that role requires protection to do the job. And playing 1 game every 5 in your preferred role doesn't count either. 

Either scrap Jorginho from the lineup and have Zakaria in back of Mount as an anchor (if he can perform there) instead of having a deep lying playmaker and another 8 next to him (Conor, RLC, Kai), or play Jorgi + Zakaria with him similar to Sarri's 3 man midfield (DLP, defensive B2B, offensive B2B as RLC had in winter of 18/19). Main problem being that we have 4 players who can potentially play in that position (Kai, Conor, RLC, Mount) which is why i prefer the former (Anchor + 2 8's).",,,,,,,"Shouldnt he be telling them pass a bit quick...leave the rest. How is he as a coach okay with players walking and passing the ball to each other. Did you see the last play of the match, jorgi sent it to kepa...it's the same play over and over again. It has to do with coaching.",,,,That’s fair. But watch Diego Costa goal contributions. Made me realize our strikers don’t need everything perfectly at their feet. Need some creative finishing,,,,,,,,,
1038,"It's quite funny how spurs didn't even waste energy pressing us, they knew we would do absolutely fucking nothing with our possession so they just let us have it, until inevitably give them free possesion snd they just pick us off",,,,,"refreshing to see comments like this, because you are absolutely correct",,,,,,,,"No need to be petty mate. Calling me deluded because I think that Zakaria should get a start over RLC in a big match. Time and time again RLC plays poorly, and yet the first game Zakaria plays in his has a great performance and the middle looked much more balanced, its not insane to suggest taking a gamble on him. You sounded like you were trying to take away from his performance because it was Zagreb (who aren't a shit team) and therefore he doesn't merit being given a chance.",,,,,,,"This discourse is part of the problem. I get the counter-takes in response to the American favoritism. But Mount and Ziyech were truly woeful, and lumping in someone that played 15 minutes seems hardly helpful.",,,,"But Salzburg are also a higher quality team. Milan also drew with them. 

The loss at Zagreb is much worse than the draw here.",,,,,,,,,
1039,"You press us? We lose the ball. We press you? You score. Build from the back takes us 2 minutes to push the ball to their half, only to be crossed to absolutely no one in the box. But on the other side we can't counter for shit. Watching us play is a punishment atm, i am done.",,,,,These lads are human beings,,,,,,,,"It just makes me mad that everyone constantly nags on Kai when he is constantly played out of position. You can’t expect him to be KDB when he literally plays his position once every 5th go around. 

These managers think way too much. Just play the guys where they work. Tuchel was the same way. Potters just on another level with it.",,,,,,,Puli played for like 15 minutes,,,,"I think even minamino and Mane too and if I'm not wrong Naby keita was there too. So yeah, not bad for a small team lol. 
As they say a baby lion is still a lion, no one should think Mane would be as easy to play against when young. And same is true for every future great player of theirs. 

They have the quality. I couldn't identify today but there was a Leipzig mid with blonde hair there who I think will be good in future. If not with us, he'll do really well elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,
1040,It’s been the same thing for the past year and a half,,,,,Who should’ve played in the deepest spot if not Enzo? He can’t both play in the deepest spot and also get on the ball further up the pitch… great player but he can’t teleport,,,,,,,,Same people who feel RLC is elite I guess,,,,,,,Pulisic had 0 time to make an actual impact on the game,,,,What did I say mate,,,,,,,,,
1041,They better be good. I wonder if they’ll get Drogba this time to say “trust the process.”,,,,,We were not 10th before Potter lol,,,,,,,,He deserves to play more but I can’t blame Potter for not trusting him against the current best team in the PL on his first ever PL match. Not to mention Zak picked up a knock in that match.,,,,,,,I got downvoted for saying Pulisic was bad. Apparently I’m not insane. So that’s good.,,,,"just because that’s how two teams have found success doesn’t mean it’s the only way. 

you simply have to score more than your opponents. if they score 0, the job in attack is a lot easier",,,,,,,,,
1042,How can you expect chemistry when potter is inexplicably giving players 3 days off midweek after losing to the worst team in the league,,,,,"2 goals in last 6 matches? no we were bad, but not this bad.",,,,,,,,"Well Kante was elite, Kova can be, and Jorginho for whatever he is, won UEFA POTS.

They just all regressed/always hurt. Can understand fans who think back to only 18 months ago when they dominated Real and City’s midfields in the UCL.",,,,,,,"That’s on Tuchel, Ziyech and Pulli both on shit form. Why bring them on against a team who are defending hard when we are down a goal.",,,,"Yep, agreed.",,,,,,,,,
1043,Stop the pointless changing Benoit has been one of our best players and he was on the bench today? Havertz been shit up top and still getting chances there instead of grooming a natural talent there Fofana or just play Auba and switch to a back 3 which is best for James and Chilwell.,,,,,"Yeah true, mb mb",,,,,,,,"I hear what you're saying, it's easy for me to say take a chance, but in hindsight playing Zakaria probably wouldn't have made the midfield performance any worse than it was today, surely he has to be given more chances. I believe it was cramp setting in against Zagreb as to why he was subbed.",,,,,,,"Oh yea, all his fault?!",,,,Ziyech was a sub,,,,,,,,,
1044,I think we can expect more than 0. They’re top level professionals.,,,,,Poor guy...smh,,,,,,,,Maybe he’ll get a chance Vs city. I honestly don’t see how it could be worse than any of our other fit midfielders.  Jorginho/RLC combo isn’t it. It just sucks that we’ve been absolutely ravaged by injury,,,,,,,Did you see Reece literally laugh at him for wanting to take that second free kick?,,,,"Oh you misunderstand - I think 7 points is the minimum to get us through, given that other results go our way. But surely ending on 10 points is guaranteed RO16?",,,,,,,,,
1045,Arteta is his worst period had triple the number of wins in the same amount of matches. And then people compare him with potter.,,,,,Missing an /s here right?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kepa shouldn't even have the opportunity to look good against Dinamo ffs man we are truly screwed when silva retires man,,,,"I'm not, however Potter is not the answer.

The subs are always too late. He's rotating half the team each week to keep players happy, these are all glaringly shit decisions and he doesn't learn from them. There is no process, the only process there is, is to get us relegated",,,,,"It’s absolutely ridiculous.

All it took was for one unlucky draw for the absolute morons to come out of the woodwork again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"he was completely at fault for the goal, came out way too early and gave Orsic the opportunity to shoot before Fofana closed him down enough.

But we were debating performance weren’t we?",,,,,,,,,
1049,">It seems like our attacking strategy is just ""go out there and express yourself lads"".

Not from what I could see. Ziyech looked like he was being instructed to track back and play as inverted wingback on that side, with James more auxilarry third centre back allowing overloads on the left from Chilwell and Sterling. Looks like bad tactical instructions.",,,,,"If you ask me him being an attacking midfielder is a joke he's a box to box I'm always so frustrated watching how late he passes and a majority of the time he chooses the worst option or completely misses the opportunity to play someone 

Kova Enzo Mount midfield  Felix and havertz drifting wide and central with fofana heading the attacking.

Mount just isn't quick enough for those decisive killer balls",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's not just the system, the players are the problem too.

Not hated enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"How is system bad, we litreally has countless chances to get the final ball, no one can pass a simple pass, everyone hits the first man, how is a system gonna change that. They were defendending for their lives, what system makes us dominate more, there were acres of space, which system gives us more? It's not systems fault that our players can't pick a man for fuck sake. System can be questioned when other team outclassed ours, they didn't, they didn't come to our keeper a whole half.",,,,"Lol, doesn't matter. Same logic applies to subs. People really just argue for the sake of arguing. I need to get off Reddit.",,,,,,,,,
1053,When Reece can barely join the attack you know we’re being badly coached.,,,,,He is pure shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We are literally Donut FC. No semblance of any midfield - hollow in the middle.  We just keep passing in a  semicircle.,,,,"Salzburg and Zagreb being still relatively weak teams means 10 might be enough. Still that means needing 3 wins in 4, and I don't see that happening with the crazy schedule coming up...

Let us see if Potter decides to make some tougher decisions in terms of player selection that Tuchel seemed unwilling to towards the end of his tenure. Making some bold choices might be key to getting those points now",,,,,,,,,
1054,You can’t be serious,,,,,*overrated :),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Only reason mount was worse was that he played both halves for some reason. Ziyech had by far the worst performance.,,,,It’s been 1 match. You’re embarrassing yourself.,,,,,,,,,

Potter isn't the answer. I think we need to start accepting these shit games are going to happen often from now. I really wanted Zidane.,,,,,,,,,
1056,"Hell, I would kill to only lose three in a row at this point.",,,,,How do you know this? Also I think if he did have personal issues then he wouldn't/shouldn't be playing at all,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kepa Kai and kova were the only bright spots today,,,,I’d be more worried about the players that have spent 80% more time on the pitch and looked just as bad if not worse.,,,,,,,,,
1057,Yeah massive prick,,,,,you know this how? has he had them all year? why the fuck is he playing in a derby if he isn’t able to be mentally present? if you’re right that’s on potter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty good honestly. Wanted the ball in pressured situations and came far out to keep the ball in dinamos half aswell,,,,"Not really sure how this can be a serious comment. 

Zagreb only played Servilla because they finished third behind Salzburg, in the Champions League group stages and it wasn't close. 

Zagreb were also knocked out of Europa by that same servilla side.

While Salzburg drew and then lost with Bayern Munich. A slight quality difference. 

Going back as far as beating Spurs. 

Salzburg beat Lille(who won Ligue 1 that year), and Servilla, drew with us Bayern and Milan.",,,,,,,,,
1058,"The positive from all of this going so spectacularly wrong is that they've always wanted to emulate Liverpool's ownership model. 



Liverpool's owners did exactly the same thing at the start of their reign and it was also a complete disaster and they learned from it and pretty much demolished every single thing they'd done since coming in and started again but removed themselves entirely from the process and allowed football people to do every football job. 


The difference between our situation and the Liverpool situation is that our ownership group with their ""own men"" have failed even more spectacularly and even more quickly. Which hopefully will mean that our owners will learn in one season instead of 2+ seasons and walk outs and protests like Liverpool's owners took. 



Though, I'm not sure they have any interest in learning from their failings yet. I think they'll let this go on for a lot longer yet.",,,,,The excuses aren't getting creative but it's definitely a step forward from *2 times POTY*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty decent game from him imo, i like him a lot better further back. Really lets him use his dribbling and frame better.",,,,"Sure.

Figuring out that 11 and keeping the fringe players involved enough to not throw up shitty performances when subbed on.

He also tries to play fast and looks to progress the play but we just didn't get enough from the players ahead of him. I have no idea how he is being identified as a reason for this poor performance.

Maybe it’s because he has Mason “can’t complete a through ball to save his life” Mount providing as much creativity as me on my couch behind him,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That’s what happens when you don’t develop any of the players over two years while constantly telling the media it is their fault and they need better players. Did we need more expensive players to beat this random assortment of Croatian dudes? Absolutely not. We needed tactics that actually work and some rehearsed attacking patterns for our attackers to run and we have neither. That’s on Tuchel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately that approach requires a ridiculous amount of cohesion between your front players and our front players look like they've never even spoken to each other before.,,,,,Mount is out of form. Havertz has played like this in 80% of his appearances for Chelsea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oh hell no. A player that does't track back and showed he's hopeless in PSG if he's not spoilt and catered like in Barcelona?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1078,"Time to go back to 3atb with Ben and Reece playing as actual wingbacks imo.

And before anyone says that’s a defensive set-up and won’t help us with goals - it’s 3atb not 5atb, wingbacks actually are more attackers than defenders. 

This should help push Ben and Reece to push up to provide width, with the attackers taking a more narrow role, which imo fits Felix/Havertz/Mount and even Ziyech more. Things can definitely change when Sterling/Mudryk/Madueke plays but I feel 5atb actually gives us more dynamics, and wingers will be less isolated. With this set up it should also help our midfield I.e. Enzo. 

The biggest culprit however, is Thiago being injured at this point might not allow us to play 3atb as easily.",,,,,"Havertz will come good, but there’s some serious cause for concern with Mount. He’s not half the player he was a year and a half ago. That shouldn’t happen with someone so young.

Edit: Boy you guys are really down on Havertz. I know he’s been out of form, but there’s a place for him on this team. Might require a different formation, different tactics, etc., but it’d be stupid to give up on him now. 

As for Mount, he’s been totally lifeless for a while now. Again, I hate the thought of giving up on him, but at least with Havertz you see flashes of a great player.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In theory we should back the manager.

Of course they are not going to impact the game as when they had the wing back freedom, but the difference between the two shouldn't be as large as is shown here.",,,,,They've also conceded more goals than Everton.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bruv this wasn’t the Prem, it was a team I’ve never heard of in a league I didn’t even know existed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1084,"Yea agreed, Mudryk looks a lot closer to scoring in 5 minutes of play than Felix does in 90. But we haven't scored at all, and he has shown good pace, touch on the ball and capabilities for creating play. If I were to criticise Felix it would be more general awareness of defensive duties. He should not have allowed himself to get bodied for the ball for Spurs first goal",,,,,"I'm not saying Potter is a Chelsea level manager, but who do we replace him with? It won't be Zidane

Firing Potter now for an equal or worse manager will be a huge step backwards. This rebuild is a process and we don't even have our main playmakers available. I think we'll look so much better with Felix, Kova and Kante if he'll ever play again -- and then hopefully another Tommy Tactics comes around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"70% possession more attacks than them. We just created shit chances with terrible passes... or not passing at all with being too slow or not shooting.

We didn't deserve to get a goal against us with their only 2 attacks though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1085,Is it me or do all of his shots go straight at the keeper. It’s actually quite impressive how he does it every time,,,,,"After watching BLUELOCK, I'm glad he took the shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Honestly giving up here would've probably meant straight up leaving.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1086,Who's Misha?,,,,,He created more chances and has more shots on target,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This is the perfect way to put it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1087,"Aye, I don't know why I'm even comparing them. Lampard got us top 4 with a transfer ban, and introduced a core of youngsters who would later help us to UCL glory.

What I should say is that Lampard was never as bad as Potter.",,,,,Yeah it is more the case that a good performance from Havertz would count as lucky.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yeah this was awful. It was like they were trying but also trying so poorly and lacking any creativity or decision making. It’s like let’s just smash a ball across goal and see if anyone can do anything and repeat. Nobody thinking let’s hit some from range, let’s cross into Broja who’s huge in the air, let’s try a short cut back at least if they’d have came together for a plan it might have looked like something. Also did the captain/s not try to regroup the team and sort it out and Tuchel just looked pissed off and just seemed to be sitting in the dugout with no plans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1088,"I wonder what she gets paid, though?

Probably a lot by normal standards, but maybe 1% to 2% of what Potter is getting paid…?",,,,,Excuses starting again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I never seen a professional footballer let alone a midfielder be so afraid to make passes forward or In behind its so pathetic,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1089,"Shame, would be a good pr move.",,,,,And if it didn’t hit the post it would have been cleared by two defenders. The lob wasn’t the play there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Seems like that includes shooting also. We are afraid to attack,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1090,I think most people would be,,,,,You can't gel 5 new players instantly with the squad. Look them all fucking being slow while Enzo was giving them through balls. They are morons who expect back passes from our DM (Jorginho) and not making progressive passes. Only the new guys have been great and Kepa and Silva as usual. The others are shit as usual.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Question then becomes - why is the team afraid to make mistakes?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1091,"None, more of a joke but she’s also a mentality monster and proper chels",,,,,same,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What on earth could Ziyech possibly have said to Reece that he thought ""nah you're right no way you hit the wall again, go for it"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1092,"What's any male coach's experience in coaching women's football? It's the same game, same rules with absolutely no differences.",,,,,Both were also horrible but Mount genuinely disappears in games now. He contributes nothing and I don’t think he has more than 1 good game all year. Unacceptable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,who even has that in their locker? thats not even really jorgis game and he is the only one,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1093,I believe so but not sure,,,,,Ziyech was awful and should never play again. Doesn’t excuse how terrible Mount has been all year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That’s the hard part about all of this though. Is that on Tuchel or our players being that technically poor? I seriously don’t know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1094,"Exactly he is ruining our mentality we didn’t look like we wanted to beat SPURS, how can the new players understand the culture of the club if the manger doesn’t represent our values.",,,,,Yeah he does beat behind a striker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Love this comment,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1095,"Because hes making us worse? 

Because then our next manager can start imposing himself on the team? 

Because losing, much like winning, can become a pattern? 

Because player confidence is a thing? 

Because people pay to watch this? 

Because we are chelsea not a fucking clown club?",,,,,"I agree although I do think he deserves some more game time, such as being subbed on with 30 minutes to go to get some action and agression going forward up top. Loved his energy today, even though he is not quite Chelsea level yet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You’re joking but if I were the owner or a majority shareholder, I would really not like the fact we’ve lost so much money and actually regressed even further.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1096,Can get relegated still,,,,,"What level? Havertz is shit, so yes i will take Fofana over him",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hahahahaha TT out,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1097,"Boehly is talking about giving him a pre season, which to me is even more mental",,,,,I was basing this off what the match thread said and what people were saying in the comments. Good that he’s not injured.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because the team orbits around it’s manager, not the other way around. And it’s more likely that the cause of bad tactics is the tactician himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1098,At the very least we want the new manger to get the transfer window and a full pre season. I really hope the wheels are in motion to get someone else in.,,,,,he still ran around like a headless chicken and his positional recklessness is what lost us control in the midfield and forced enzo to play deeper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agreed. Felt like we were fighting under Lampard but couldn't help but concede each match. This feels much more like that last Mourinho year where it was just dire from start to finish.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1099,We could maybe salvage our champions league run. It's almost a guaranteed loss with Potter in charge.,,,,,Agreed with Gallagher but this was definitely one of his better performances for us so far.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Almost like everything is being coached out of them…,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1100,That was the same argument people had to keep Lampard. Then Tuchel came in and won us the champions league,,,,,"I agree with this, Mount has performed in the past. I'm concerned for Gallagher. When he's on form his end product is great, but I just don't see enough technical quality to allow us to control games with him playing midfield.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So the opposite of how City did it,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1101,Oh boy… I made the argument about destroying careers and confidence a month ago probably. Here we are… I am very afraid this is not the last we’ve seen of this fraud though.,,,,,Can’t wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nope, Reece was clearly playing RCB when Ziyech came on. Look how far back he stayed in possession. 

Then he movec Reece back to RWB when he put on Cucurella. Then we had Reece and Ziyech as wing backs and Cucu as LCB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1102,I swear Tommy would be lifting another CL trophy come May if he came in this weekend and managed this squad,,,,,"people are actually saying ""2 weeks"" as if its a lot of time... try to better any skills in 2 weeks and see how far you get",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pulled rank on James as well .. who was once again our best player.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1103,I mean we can still finish top 6. If we even draw against utd city and arsenal and win the rest. But I guess potter doesn’t know the math.,,,,,"I know, crazy talk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Shouldn’t have been allowed to hit again. Nevermind his first free kick or performance in general but why not have a right footer have a go at it for a change.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1104,"honestly? We're not completely immune to relegation yet. I look at the remaining games this season with Potter in charge, and the only HOPE's i have of a win are next week against Leeds (although even they managed to beat Southampton) and Bournemouth. 

I can't see a game coming up where we're a better than 50/50 chance of winning (other than those two) with the horrendous form we're in.",,,,,"""Players need to gel"", ""Manager needs more time"". Etc. Excuses upon excuses. We've been shit under Potter since he took over and everytime the excuses flow in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Major prick vibes too. If Lukaku was a midfielder,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1105,"We could literally be relegated at this rate, we still have to play basically everyone above us and we can't even get a point against Southampton",,,,,Against Fulham,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How did neither Mason or Reece overrule him?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1106,Definitely should have done the backroom overhaul first before reassessing Tuchel IMO.,,,,,"You will never convince these people. When we are still shit in a month's time, they'll find new excuses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hit the first man on a corner and the second attempt too. and caught the ball while it was in play,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1107,That is concerning. The club might end up like Leeds.,,,,,It was a bunch of kids,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Intentionally. Actually I changed my mind about trading him. He needs to be punished and subbed for the season. 0 minutes to play the whole season.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1108,several people deserved to go.. no question about it. Our squad management was atrocious. Signing Lukaku was a bonkers decision amongst others,,,,,"We just bought like seven guys, and just had three come back from injury. Of course it’s going to take some time. 

Seriously, if you expected them to play great today, that’s on you. Guess what, it’s not going to be great next game either",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doesn't mean he can act like a bitch. These are professional players, plus we're still paying his wages. Fucking Lukaku vibes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1109,"Don't ignore the fact that the galring issues in this squad stem mainly from Roman's awful recruitment in the past 5 years. Also don't forget that at the time Tuchel was sacked we had looked terrible for a long time, this performance today was not as bad as that game in Zagreb and there was no indication we would ever break out of that slump. Tuchel also seemed like he would not survive mentally having to coach this shitshow (which is completely understandable).

We are obviously shocking and it looks like we may never score again but don't romanticise about the past like things weren't bad.",,,,,To be dull as well with the rest of them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Didn't they both try to leave?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1110,Yeah to make his dick feel bigger,,,,,Genuine question because it is always like that. Reactionary and rubish takes from fans that take away from about 5% of actual match commentary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Crowdfunding a contract termination is on the table boys.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1111,"I didn’t adore him. TT wasn’t that great either. He lost to Southampton too this season, mismanaged Lukaku, got rid of good talent, and thought Auba was a good signing! TT got lucky to win the Champions league. 
We need a top manager, not a good one. TT is a petulant child with no character or leadership skills. 

I’d rather have Conte back than him. Hands down.",,,,,Exactly,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That doesn't make it any better man ngl.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1112,"Well all Potter does is sit quietly on the touch line so keep him as ""manager"" and keep Silva on the bench and he can just shout from there without certificates",,,,,They are 6th in the league with the same amount of goals scored as Man United…. It’s just reputation makes them seem like a joke. They are not. They are a really good team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So spurs is our standard now?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1113,"I don't think so, but I do remember Avram Grant who was made manager without a UEFA cert but they gave him time to get it while managing. But obviously he had managed before.",,,,,"I didn’t see anything wrong with Mount. On individual level, as I said there were problems with Mudryk, Cucurella (the worst), and Chilwell after he came. The rest were tactical issues. Now you will gone mad because I didn’t mention Kai among the screwed ups, the reason I didn’t mention him is he played as he has been playing for Chelsea in since his arrival. Mount had good days when he scored and assisted, but today was just normal Mount. That’s his capacity, if you want to expect him to be Lampard, that’s another story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,But spurs are shit so don’t matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1114,Factually incorrect to call it as bad. He was never near this bad.,,,,,"What I am trying to say, they both, never been Lampard or Gerrard. Obviously, Both of them have exceptional work rates, but this alone doesn’t help us. That’s why I’m telling they were okay. 
You can’t expect Opel to be Porsche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Why did Tuchel spend all the time buying CBs then? Move to a back 4 and spend some money on some good, creative midfielders. Cucurella was such a wasteful signing as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1115,"difference was arteta had no money to spend, we splurged big on this team and yet here we are",,,,,"It's bc dudes on here have man crushes on certain players. He's been shit for 3 years but it's always ""ThIs IsnT FiFa"" ""hE nEeDS TimE"" blah blah",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"no matter the position, havertz and mount are considered out of position lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1116,Dont remember Arteta going 1 win in 15 games,,,,,And who the hell was going to play that position today? Our midfield is full of injured players…,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If Lukaku went to City, he would probs have almost as much goals as Haaland (who also thrives in counter attacking situations). It’s not the player’s limitations, it’s the system’s…",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1117,"Hello boehlybot, where's the process?",,,,,He made player of the year when half the team was injured and the other  half were shit. Ppl can't prop him up on that forever.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Look closely at how real play and you’ll see that there is a variety in how they play. They overload through wingers and fullbacks and know when to hold possession and when to sit and wait for a counter.

When was the last time we let a player through on the counter or through on goal for a 1-1? Any striker would struggle with us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1118,Imagine if he was an American manager. Yeeeeesh,,,,,I shouldn’t be grouping them. Havertz is the striker whether people like it or not and he isn’t scoring Chelsea’s goals.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Dribbled around a lot and passed out of multiple shot attempts,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1119,"Glenn Hoddle wasn't holding back in the post match show... He called for the sack right at the end, I think?",,,,,"He's a Benfica fan, of course he's here to troll lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Di Matteo has the excuse that he was in over his head from day one, and we all knew that CL was a fluke, carried by the more senior players in our squad.

Tuchel is supposed to be levels above Di Matteo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1120,"Complete bollocks, anyone who is still 100% behind Potter is doing so because they're just stupid. English people have no bias to a manger who performs like this as shown various times in the history of the league.",,,,,Could you remind me how many new players did feature today's game? I guess he should've coached them remotely for past 6 months.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,graham potter,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1121,"He became a scapegoat for our losses, and now he’s out of the XI it’s even clearer the problem goes way deeper beyond one player’s form.",,,,,"How many of those players were starting? Or have had any decent game time yet. You’re all acting like the squad has been healthy and together for months, hasn’t even been 1 game",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He doesn’t have the leg strength,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1122,You can criticize him but Giving death threat is a plain stupidity I have felt bad for him that reason.,,,,,"I keep seeing people say Chukwuemeka - I’ll give you Lewis Hall because he’s played well but Carney Chukwuemeka has not looked like he’s ready for this level yet when he’s played. 

One thing I would love to see is Chalobah as the defensive midfielder while the others are out. He’s played there before and you know he won’t drift up and get lost. He might lack in a lot of areas but at least you know he’ll hold his space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No dawg in him,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1123,Why Boehly,,,,,Agreed. I really hope the next few weeks things to change as the team gets more integrated because it’s been genuinely shocking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Football is a ruthless sport mate. Mount doesn’t deserve a 6 year deal at all. You bring up 2 POTYs but that’s a fan voted award. He’s been poor against teams that aren’t named Norwich. If he didn’t come from the academy people would view him as an above average player at best. There isn’t really anything he excels at. He’s our Jordan Henderson. Tuchel needs to bench him,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1124,"I mean 90% to 100% is not that a big jump.

But yeh he needs sacking.

If it was Roman who was watching Chelsea in place of Boehly he would have sacked him from the stand in the middle of the match 😂.",,,,,"That's a fair point, I'm personally hoping for Felix behind Fofana next game. Might be wishful thinking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s bizarre, he’s openly said multiple times that he came up with this system pragmatically, trying to cover Jorginhos and Silva’s lack of athleticism and get the best players all on the pitch. It was just making due with the team he had after taking over mid season.

But then why the fuck are we MARRIED to this shit now?! Fucking reassess my man! It’s not like he played like this with Dortmund or PSG. I never know how much blame to put on players vs managers, but it’s easy to see when almost EVERYONE is playing like shit. You don’t have like 17 players just coincidentally hitting a 9 month run of bad form at the same time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1125,That thing the other teams do,,,,,"and this happens EVERY FUCKING GAME since he came in.

the tactics are awful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think if we had *no manager* at all, and the players just picked the team and formation themselves for Fulham, and played how they wanted… I honestly think we’d be more likely to get a result on Saturday without him than with Tuchel’s disastrous midfield instructions.

He is actively damaging us right now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1126,Just a tamer touchdown.,,,,,"I'm over that Havertz hate too.. He is not that bad, he always press the defenders, etc. People just thinks he is Mbappe or something.

Even days like today, were we play like shit, he still being the one who created more chances for us...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They are holding on to that Champions League win. Without that he’s already gone,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1127,And lowerlights,,,,,"I'd love to showing optimisim with Kai but I'm sorry I disagree with a lot of this. I really don't see where his movement was good other than a nice run for Ziyech crossed chance. He pondered way too long on that chance and made it harder for himself by allowing the GK time to come out and put him off. The other chance 1 on 1 with the Thiago pass, once again a recurring theme with Kai is all he ever does is tap every single shot at goal. If he actually had the sense to hit it hard it's not allowing the GK any chance to make a save, but alas he only ever taps shots at goal with no conviction.

Regarding work rate he runs about which is grand but as the game went on, he started looking lazy imo, was that time Madueke got it out wide and played a headed pass forward and Kai was nowhere to be seen, just walking. That Robinson roasted him out on the right wing and he didn't even try to challenge for it. Not expecting him to get onto these things  but in the past he would try a lot more, I think he's at absolute rock bottom in terms of making this move work out. 

What service did he get? This excuse is made for him every single game I'm so sick of hearing it. He got service today and often fumbled it on the ball, was put through on goal and fumbled that chance again too. Where do you begin to question that he has to do more to get into games himself..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,everyone's already been questioning the players,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1128,Insult to injury,,,,,"If we are ""giving pre-pre-season"" time to someone, I don't want Potter to be that someone. I don't trust him with improving - he did not show any sign of improvement so far. How long does he need to show even the slightest sign?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Any one of our players would be by far the best player on that Zagreb squad. The way they are setting up and playing together is the problem, and that’s on Tuchel. This squad is good enough to beat Southampton, Leeds, etc. Tuchel isn’t good enough to get that out of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1129,it’s time for todd to go as well,,,,,"What is your solution? I wish we still had Tuechel but even he can't stitch a team together with Mount and Gallagher as our backbone

We literally don't have a midfield other than Enzo Fernandez.

IF we fire Potter, who replaces him? and don't say Zidane bc that's not happening",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anyone not questioning Tuchel *and* the players is delusional.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1130,I have never seen them look so bad since I’ve been a fan. We look like a relegation side with one of the best rosters in Europe.,,,,,"What tactics would you suggest for team with  single midfeilder? or better yet what is the fundamental problem in Potter's tactics? 

It's like all this subreddit can muster up in thought is #managerout",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You must be new fan then. Blindly following manager doesn't make those fans better.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1131,we're gonna recover in the Championship mate,,,,,"Yes gems like De Zerbi should be around. The new sporting team has enough years of experience between them to scout Europe for a new coach

Potter should be fired already before it’s too late. This is a guy with no football vision Clearlake, are planing to waste time attempting to build a dynasty around?

All that investment and the assumption was that we would be back in the race for too 4 - 6.
How are draws to Fulham “improvement” 

The old guard of Terry, Lampard, drogba, won’t stand for that bullshit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We have old players who were good (or at least a lot better than now) and are now shit and new players who were good somewhere else and are now shit. What do they have in common?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1132,Has anyone actually seen a Potter In fan in the last 2 weeks?,,,,,"Badiashile, Madueke, Santos, Gusto ? + most of them you haven’t even seen properly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Are you saying that no manager in the world would have us playing any better than we are under Tuchel? 

We absolutely aren’t winning any trophies playing like this",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1133,"Because the manager has no clue on motivating the players and making them believe. That behavior tells one thing - we came into this game hoping for 0-0, knowing that we can’t score.",,,,,"What is he trying to do, have players make forward passes? They don't need a manager to tell them that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He’s the manager. He needs to find a solution. What’s he being paid for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1134,"No thanks for Mourinho, we made that mistake last time and it set us back years. Just let Mourinho be part of our past. We love him, he loves us, but there’s a reason he’s not still manager.",,,,,So you didn’t think he looked poor then?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I dunno manage the team maybe?

If all there is to management is picking a formation and making substitutions any of us could do it",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1135,It's like tourettes with y'all.  Mourinho or Tuchel.  Mourinho or Tuchel.  Mourinho or Tuchel.  There are other fucking managers and Mourinho is past his prime.,,,,,"In honesty, we've seen glimpses of brilliance from this team but not on the consistency that we would like, but we've had major set backs, i get peoples frustrations with Potter, i have them myself but i feel backing him is what we should do, because of the backing with this huge budget we've just thrown around.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,">I mean what else is there

Winning",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1136,I heard it is like a home run.,,,,,"We reintroduced Cuca and Reece, this was Mudryk's second game, Enzo has been with the squad for all of two days. I wouldn't expect them to play with any real cohesion.

Badiashile is showing progression in the defense, which is a positive.

I don't even know what to think about the midfield, because mount and Gallagher have been shocking.

The team has been together for eight months, but there hasn't been any real consistency in who plays during those eight months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If you ask people on here they genuinely believe he's telling players not to shoot, not to pass forwards, not to take players on, not to make incisive runs. 



We created more than enough to win today and our players were just treating it like we won the game by default. They weren't shooting when they had the chance, they weren't making runs across their defenders when crosses were made, they were constantly offside etc. etc.



Tuchel has no control over these things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1137,Potentially our last Champions League match for a while. Let's bring some good luck!,,,,,"Lol, this sub just arrived at the point where people are just saying things for the sake of saying things",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That's the point.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1138,😭😭😭,,,,,Sterling played better in the middle than mount did and madueke better in the right than Ziyech.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He's a defensive first mentality and in turn shouldn't be strange he lacks qualities to inspire attack.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1139,"Yeah he was sacked after 4 games, they went a further 3 with no goals or points before beating Chelsea on game week 8",,,,,"Mate I feel for you. 

The effort some of our international fans put in for this club just for the club to play like shite. 

Surprised the game didn’t put you to sleep though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Change to better shapes? Coach the team to be more urgent from the get go rather than after conceding goals? Coach the team to try different passing rather than just from the sides?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1140,I’m one more poor half away from using the term “Pottersexual”,,,,,My bosses paid me too watch this. I might have to give them money back.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When the entire team routinely has bad “individual performances” that is no longer a problem for any of the players. That’s the manager not getting performances out of his squad.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1141,[deleted],,,,,India?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Our results were bad towards end of Lampard era but players seemed more content. They seem defeated now and whatever system they’re playing is way too cagey for them to succeed clearly,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1142,The flick pass putting Havertz through on goal was class. He showed spirit pressing and had a few nice passes. His best showing in a while. Gives credit to the idea that he could use a spell on the bench coming in as a sub to get his form back.,,,,,Yup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Some of it falls back on the club captain, who for the last 8 months had a wondering eye. New leadership needed. Give the armband to James already.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1143,"Much more direct, good switches to Reece, put Havertz through on goal, Havertz just wasn’t quick enough to get there ahead of the keeper, etc. More urgency/less waffling around than most of the others, who were content to pass back with 2 minutes left",,,,,"Feels like they’re normally shit ~~after a break~~

FTFY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tuchel screams toxic, every single player not named Reece and Thiago has regressed since he’s come in. If winning a UCL was enough for tenure then di matteo would still be our coach. One good cup run can only go so far…",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1144,"No way, this season he’s dropped some genuine 2/10s. Hes been well off it especially recently but today was an improvement",,,,,you want to replace Havertz instead of Mount?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Because they either don’t understand what the match plan is or they don’t believe in it anymore. This happens at almost every club, all the time. Players lose faith or confidence. Then a new manager comes in and suddenly: “Woah everyone suddenly looks better!”",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1145,I watched the one where he came on and was the only one who did anything of note in the last half an hour 👍,,,,,"Yea, even tho he looked pretty good I don't want to see Enzo so deep in the Jorgi role. I'd like to see him with freedom to push forward a little more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes because they clearly don’t know what to do out on the pitch. Which is the manager’s job to implement. You can’t seriously believe that ALL of our attacking players suddenly just turned to shit on their own??,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1146,Thanks for your kind words. Just feel so despondent about the situation.,,,,,"His work rate is good and I felt his positioning and movement weren’t bad, but not great on passing and pressing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You guys clearly can’t read. It’s clearly not JUST the players. It is of course on them as well. But there’s a reason that things aren’t clicking. You think all of these attackers that have been successful elsewhere met in the dressing room pre-match and said, “Let’s fuck this up on purpose. Let’s purposely do the opposite of what Tuchel wants.”

There’s clearly confusion about expectations. There’s clearly some reason that these guys are afraid to shoot. There’s CLEARLY a reason that players who have scored for fun with other teams don’t know what to do when they get near the goal. It’s not the Chelsea shirt that keeps them from scoring. It’s not a curse. It’s a manager that can’t coach a successful attack with the players he has. Every club goes through this. This isn’t new. There will be a new manager and a new manager rebound where the goals start flowing in and then the problem will change to the defense. This is football.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1147,"Ah this is a bit hyperbolic, things do seem grimm though so I can understand why you think that. We had our disaster season under Mourinho and got Conte in.

I think we'll be fine long term but the next appointment is very important to success in coming seasons.",,,,,Mount was worse and that’s saying something considering how bad Connor was,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Read my comment again. It’s clearly not JUST the players at fault here. It is partially their fault of course but you can’t tell me that they all forgot how to score as soon as they put on a Chelsea shirt??

I’m actually entertained at how teams like Fulham Brighton and brentford are playing but they gotta have a drop in form soon I’d think. 

It’s hard though because as much as Potters been backed by the board with their vote of confidence and now all these signings, I’m still not convinced he’s the guy yet.

1171,"Well... no. 

When we lost to Dortmund (I don't think there's any 'if' here) our season is absolutely dead. We will need about 0.5-0.6 points per game to avoid any possible flirt with relegation. 

When that happens, there's no reason not to keep Potter as results are completely meaningless at that point. And if you're going to keep him until the summer, you might as well give him the preseason, and if you do that, you might as well keep him until the winter. So yeah, November/December 23 is when I would expect Potter to be gone. 

I also can't agree that 'a new manager won't have time to change much before Dortmund'. Most managers get better results right away ('the bounce') and that is their window to implement their own tactical approach. Under Tuchel we improved literally week to week. As did Villa under Emery or Wolves under Lupetegui.

We also have an incredibly talented squad that is completely directionless. Potter was brought to develop young players and I'm not sure he's even doing much developing. At the moment he seems to be oblivious to the fact that these are indeed very young players, most of them with very limited experience at the top and telling them to  'go and play' ain't gonna fly.

1179,">In the last 10 years only city won more pl titles then us.

True, but none back to back. And that was with Roman flooding cash in when we stalled, most clubs would win a few titles with the money we had. Boehly is a different owner, a banker who is happy to be patient for returns on investments. 

>Why? We have our worst form in over 20 years. Have 5 goals since christmas.

True but we've come off the back of crazy unique circumstances. With Romans sanctions, Boehly with a rushed takeover, then Tuchel and him didn't get on, pre-season was poorly utilised, sacking manager after a few games, new manager arriving and getting 10+ injuries to our most important players. It would be insane to expect our club to thrive with these conditions. Just my opinion of course, but I don't think we'd be much better off with a different manager. 

>Real madrid stable?go look at their coach history in the last 10 years lol.

Yeah that's true tbf. I was looking for current examples but there's not many atm in modern football outside of pep and Klopp. Even Bayern had been very cutthroat now I think about it.

I just don't think it's the way to build a club, I've always wanted a Ferguson/Wenger/Pep/Klopp type that changes the whole club culture and lasts for years. I wanted it to be Tuchel so badly, but sadly nowadays a manager's most important skill seems to be placating their clubs owner, and it seems this isn't on Tuchels to-learn list, from previous stories at least. 

>Lets take lfc for example since you brung them up, in 2014 brendan rodgers brought them 2nd in a very tight title race. The next year he finishes 6th or 7th and 15-16 season he started really poor and got sacked for klopp. You see this?


I'd say that's a poor example. Rogers had suarez, we've got a bunch of young players bought for their hype and potential. Even Klopp may be a  better case, he took over in October and finished 8th. But after a summer to mould and train with his squad, he got top 4 season after. Obviously Klopps pedigree from Dortmund is far above anything Potter's done, so maybe not most fitting, but an example of why a coach needs to be given time to coach. Especially technical ones like Potter that need a stable, non-injured squad and time to coach patterns of play. 

I do get why people are annoyed, football is an emotional game, and this forum is a place to vent those emotions. I just wonder if people who are becoming completely irate with Potter & Boehly need a step back. Skip a few games or something. Channeling all the multiple facets of our downfall onto Potter isn't going to help the club and our players imo.",,,,,Mount has been by far the worst player on the pitch every game this year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"That was his worst performance I’ve ever seen.

Reason why I'm not opposed to Pulisic starting is because I know he won't start Broja unless it's the FA Cup or EFL Cup... or maybe a bottom 5 team in the PL. Mount has been too poor consistently to get a start. Havertz I'm not opposed to starting as well because he can play well if he's supported by an actual striker (Auba or Broja) Sterling and Auba are our guaranteed attacking starters as of right now... so it's honestly one of Havertz or Pulisic because I see him subbing on Broja for Auba. 

I completely agree with what you said about our attack lacking coaching. It's definitely Tuchel's weakest point, which is a shame but we need to improve it as soon as possible because new attackers aren't coming until next summer (no chance we get Leao for a good price in January plus we want Alvarez) and I'm tired of seeing Sterling-Havertz-Mount... so it's either Havertz-Auba-Sterling or Pulisic-Auba-Sterling. 

Letting CHO go out on loan doesn't help us either but at least he will come back with experience and game time as long as he avoids injuries - and hopefully get a spot in the squad next season alongside incomings and Broja/Havertz/Sterling/Auba.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not saying we should do whataboutism, I'm just saying how the hell is our fanbase making our own narratives against some players?

On a 0-10 scale the first 6 games this season average about a -2 with Spurs being the only good performance.

1208,Don't compare Arteta to this fraud. We got played by Potter.,,,,,"So what's the excuse before we bought these players? We had 2 pts from 5 matches before the world cup, and the world cup break was supposed to help Potter turn things right only to return to more of the same. €600m has been injected into this squad and we cant even manage a goal against relegation fodder. How much time do we need to score a goal against Fulham?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Zagreb didn't score. Thiago isn't faster or quicker. You need a football lesson?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1209,"And atleast you could see what Arteta was trying to implement. He had already won the FA Cup in his 1st season so it was already known that he could coach a winning team.

People just think that giving any manager 2-3 years will guarantee success, regardless of whoever it is. It's such a stupid way of looking at these things.",,,,,You're acting like Fulham haven't been one of the best teams in the league this year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not sure I fully agree. I think ability wise it's spot on in that we just crumble but I don't see a team that isn't fighting or pushing tbh. A lot of people in the match thread suggesting that Tuchel has lost the players and I just don't see it myself really. I think it's important to remember that we lost a lot of big personalities too around Sarri time. Costa the season before, Fabregas, Courtois (🐍), JT and Hazard obviously huge losses and I don't think that's helped mentality wise. A lot of them were key players in league campaigns and while they could be questioned at times I think they were probably a positive influence overall. Now we have the younger group who I think do seem hungry and have desire but people like Jorginho (who I like as a player) or Ziyech just don't give me the feeling that they're going to pull the team up by the bootstraps. Thiago Silva a huge loss tonight I think too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1210,"They also compare 1 example success fallacy and fail to acknowledge the 1000's of managers which are trash and don't become super stars...

But we should have beaten them today given how much we spent on attacking talent. We could have gone past them with one goal and we could have gone past them with one fewer game played. Then the read on this would have been that we have had a better season than them.     

The margins are thin but with this much spending, we have to do better. If we can’t beat a side that is close to where we are in the table at Stamford Bridge with no major injuries (we didn’t miss irreplaceable guys like Thiago Silva or Kepa), then that’s not looking good. Period. Irrespective of the fact that Fulham have had a great season as benchmarked to the expectations from them.     

We are two weeks away from facing Dortmund. The lack of shots on target against an easier opposition than them tonight is not a good sign. If we had to face them or the PL table topper right after the window closed, yes, we would have had the firepower to beat them but we would have lacked the time to develop coordination and chemistry amongst the players. A team that’s around the same position on the table as us (when I said “it’s just Fulham”, I didn’t think of them as relegation zone folks, cos they clearly aren’t), I can’t think of that as an acceptable reason.     

There’s some weird actions and movements in the final third that just doesn’t culminate into shots on target. Our dead ball delivery has been shoddy. Apart from a long range effort by Enzo that went narrowly wide and Havertz hitting the frame of the goal, it’s tough to think of many moments we have dominated the final third.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I do agree with you and I don't think Tuchel is blameless but I also just don't see an alternative that would be a great improvement or would really solve a lot of the issues that I see.

Fuck it, get Jose back again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're not talking about Lampard/Gerrard we're talking about mount/Gallagher. They bring absolutely nothing. Gallagher is just a Duracell bunny rn and mount looks like he couldn't be bothered.

Badiashile is a beast in defense, it feels like he has stabalised our defense. Our defense has improved since Badiashile was introduced.

But offensively there is no progression at all. Everyone is just shocking offensively. Havertz is never where hes supposed to be and is never prepared to recieve the ball in the box, always too quick or too slow. Ziyech looks so uninterested in playing for us. Pulisic when he plays, he's so inconsistent and looks like bambi on ice most of the time and more often than not he's out injured. I don't understand what happened with Mount this season. Gallagher just looks like he is not ready to start for Chelsea yet.

But Reece is by far the best reason. He was literally our best attacker earlier this year when we actually had a decent run of form. the way GP has been using him recently is flat out alarming - looking at these chelsea squad and not featuring Reece as a key part of the attack is major red flag on GP’s coaching intelligence and tells me he has no business managing this project any longer.",,,,,"Sometimes the matches are at 6:30 here in Texas and it pretty much ruins most of my day.

You're trying to draw an equivalence between a player a manager wants the club to obtain for him and a player the club finds and the manager settles on when options are limited and time is a factor. 

Managers do not decide what the club allots to spend on signings. The clubs do. But you coyly said ""more than any other manager"" because if you'd have said club it wouldn't be CFC spending the most. But with other clubs having different managers over the two seasons, you were able to finesse your talking point to include the damning superlative ""more than any other"". 

Btw, do you have the numbers when it comes to net spend, because that is an important differentiation. You know, the amount that matters? We had a +£3.56mil net gain last season. Arsenal - £122.42. Man Utd - £98.37. Spurs - £55.60. Liverpool - £51.75. City - £45.63.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you believe that you’re an absolute idiot.

What made Tuchel a petulant child? Absolutely idiotic statement.

Tuchel got us to two cup finals last season and won the club world cup despite everything going on. Tuchel had an aging squad that needed to be rebuilt, he made us overperform at an insane level. Calling him lucky to win CL is absolutely disgusting and you should consider changing clubs immediately.

Also the Auba argument is irrelevant, Tuchel isn't a sporting director yet had to act as one. It should never be on him. It was also a panic buy in a shitty hastened window.",,,,,"It's not about being disjointed. It's about major tactical decisions being made which are terrible. 

For example, Enzo should never be the pivot in midfield. He lacks positional awareness and if they sit on him, we can't get the best of him on the ball. He should've asked Gallagher to play deeper and let Enzo go forward.

Also why is Mudryk so deep and wide when he should be playing next to Havertz to feed off his hold up play.

Why did Mount even play when Madueke is so much better physically and his profile matches the second striker position better.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"And yet pretty much every press conference and footage of him on the touchline is about playing the ball quicker.

Which is it? We somehow created enough but the players are also choosing  not to take people on, not to pass forward and not to shoot? Do you think the system is great and Tuchel is actually overperforming  with these attackers?

He just needs coaching, and if you're wanting to play a 4-5-1 then he will have less insistence to track back. Just put Enzo, Zakaria and one more forward-minded midfielder in a more compact structure.

We created little chances, all of our chances were half chances and mostly generated from crossing constantly which is out of desperation.

The bar is so low for Kai and Jorgi who have been terrible for a long time. Kovacic did ok considering he was forced to play as the holding #6 but not compliment worthy.

It's incredible to me that when Kai first arrived he scored a hattrick playing SS to Tammy under Frank. Now I really struggle to see his future as a player in terms of identity. Things can change quickly in football and right now is a perfect example of that. We could be title/CL contenders a month later if we kick on from Fulham and win all our games.

His best position under Tuchel was in the left or right half-space, not strictly out wide by the touchline. Even as a third midfielder, he can employ similar facets of his game and occupy the same areas.

You literally cannot say you’re “stuck” with something and mean it to be good, unless you’re trying to be overly sarcastic and mean it’s a good thing. What the fuck are you arguing with this dude about as if you didn’t say it to be a negative thing? Or if English isn’t your first language, then I understand.",,,,,Jorgi. Meant Jorgi for the year before Silva. Or Kante. Kante was better and more impactful anyway. Look at Kante playing vs. not playing splits. Our team sucks without him.  But I digress.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I agree but without leaders on the pitch, the coach is where it all lies. Rudiger was our glue the last couple years and Reece/mase haven’t stepped into that role yet. So for now, tuchel needs to do it himself and I don’t think his managerial style is conducive to that unfortunately",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1367,We havent been good since we last won the league. Clubs of this league became far more competent and the talent level of the league greatly increased. We have been exposed by big clubs that are well run. Boehly is implementing a much needed plan that has been missing for far too long. Roman was running the club poorly.,,,,,He has 2 assists in the PL and 1 in the CL. 0 in both FA Cup and EFL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No doubt about that but the problem is it ends up being a cascading effect when the players are over thinking- especially attackers. They need leadership on the pitch to supercede that and I don’t really know who has it to take that on right now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1368,"Boehly is owner because of a technicality, I wouldn’t view at as a positive.",,,,,"Sure but you can have it one way or the other.  Most would agree the squad needed overhaul and the players weren’t good enough.  Now we’ve bought some new players that haven’t really integrated.  There needs to be context with everything.  I’m not even trying to be all sunshine and rainbows, it’s just easy to see it isn’t going to turn around quick and people need to relax in here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The players were eager to try through balls at the beginning of this match, but all of the passes were poor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1369,Just imagine Boehly came in and signed one low intensity forward for 100m who lacks technical ability and a midfielder who can't handle the pace of the prem on loan and left it at that. Then on top of that let a key player and another possible long term starter run out their contracts. If Boehly had done that and nothing else this year I wonder would all his critics sing his praises for restoring the good old days of Abromovic.,,,,,I gave you an answer. Unless you cant read,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seeing Auba square it twice was like watching the reaction of a player who has been told he should have squared it last week and Auba hasn't even played before this game ffs. No doubt it's worrying but like yourself, I trust Tuchel to try every idea he can to fix it and reset minds and players intent to be their original ones.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1370,,,,,,Potter begs to differ.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Just seems silly when Pulisic added nothing to an attack for 15 minutes he gets criticized as much as someone who added nothing for 90 straight. If Mount has one shining moment leading to a goal or an assist, the entire discourse on his game changes, but he's getting infinitely more opportunities to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1371,,,,,,"Who was the previous academy player that won POTY if this is as you're presenting it? 

Last two seasons, Havertz was levels behind Mount, it's clear and obvious.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lol and the other guys did huh?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1372,,,,,,4 assist in CL according to Transfermarkt and my own calculations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Steriling should not have been playing either, he's been run into the ground so far",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1373,,,,,,"No, you didn’t",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Most of it was time wasting to be fair... Got the ball maybe 5 times, fucked up one touch on a counter at pace, had an awkward header he didn't do anything with, and then 2 or 3 completed passes or so.

Hardly can expect too much from that in a game where our entire team was horrendous and they packed 11 in the box. And regardless, he played the least, dumb to look at him to blame",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1374,,,,,,How? Felix played the one time he was available,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,could have scored is pushing it man,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1375,,,,,,"I’m not going to debate Kai vs. Mount form any longer. Anyone who watches football seriously can see the difference. And for those who can’t, they’re either ignorant or not smart enough to have a conversation with, so either way, it’s not worth it. I doubt there’s a manager in the world that would select Mount over Kai on current form, except for our dipshit manager. Which, I mean is just another hilarious thing on its own.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not sure but it’s not relevant to my comment is it?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1376,,,,,,"He has 0 goals 1 assist in 6 matches in the CL. All other football stats are reporting this. Sofascore, whoscored, fotmob, footystats, etc.. I have never used transfermarkt and after this gaffe, I'm never going to use it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,if you can’t argue maturely no point talking at all. Our entire attack is shit lol.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Saying that he has been overall better at Chelsea is ridiculous joke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If that's our biggest chance, don't you think that's more of a problem? It wasn't exactly a sitter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1379,,,,,,"Well, PK in some books counts as assist so there is one.

He had another against Milan.

Also against Salzburg, unless you're saying that's not his assist as ball touched hair on Auba leg. I don't see the point of taking away an assist from the player who played key pass, that eventually found the goal scorer, but if denying those make you feel better please do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I couldn’t give a shit less about being downvoted. Just makes me laugh how much people defend Pulisic when he’s clearly terrible.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1380,,,,,,"Uh okay but you're ignoring my point that we now have better players in his role, and we didn't before. He played because we had no one else to play there. We didn't have Mudryk and Felix for like 18 of those games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"These substitutions add real unbalance to the team. Yes before they came on we were still not playing great but the team had shape. Bring on out of form players, switching formation and playing players out of position makes everyone look like they don’t know what they should be doing. We were worse after the substitutions, that’s the main point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1381,,,,,,Denying? I'm not denying anything. Why are you taking it as a personal attacking?😂 I gave you 4 reputable football websites that compile stats. Whether you choose to believe them or not is up to you,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For 3 games, teah",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1382,,,,,,"I believe what I saw and it's as on Transfermarkt, Mount got points on FPL for assists twice so there is another source. It all comes down to the definition of the assist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mate that shot was a scorcher. Great positioning and strength to tip it onto the post,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1383,,,,,,"FPL assists have always been dodgy. Mount has 3 goals 2 assists in the PL, and 0 goals 1 assist in the CL. All sites agree with this except for transfermakt",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://twitter.com/jhdharrison1/status/1567202187100430337?s=21&t=zUHrKVzMU4PaKO5zknF_7Q,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1384,,,,,,People out here just writing fan fiction about stats now.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,">Completely at fault? Literally the whole defence was up the pitch and fofana got outpaced

Well, what do you expect when we play on the halfway line? It's a tactical approach and we should be ready to get counterattacked. Kepa just has to wait and buy time. If Wes gets there to put him off then fantastic, if not it all comes down to Orsic quality. In the end, he rushed out and Orsic pokes it past with ease. I don't think either the denders or GK handled it well tbh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,completely was an overstatement but i’m sick of subpar players sticking around at this club,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Did you see him take the Free kicks and put in crosses? (ziyech)

Mount has lost his form since start of this season. (Tuchel can be blamed for not taking him out)

Sterling can't be blamed because he was the only one who looked a little bit creative amongst the rest.

Jorginho?

Koulibaly?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1389,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a morale issue, quite frankly. Don't know how much of it is down to Tuchel or whatever, but what we most need is a kick in the arse and a good performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1390,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lol, system can't compensate for players that can't pass all the time, you get some out of system, it won't be hundred percent solution, that's why we win, when our wingback do something, as tgey can cross, but if they have a quiet day, we get things like this. Of you are blaming the system for this performance, I can't say anything to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1391,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So  by assumptions of both of you,6 players had decent games..so wtf did we lose",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1392,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jorginho?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1393,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yeah agreed. Also, where’s our captain? That’s something no one is talking about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1394,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,As if that’s the only alternative lol. Poor tactics and new teammates is what it most likely is. These are pro footballers. Most of them love the club. You think they’re so childish that they would put in a bad game to spite the manager? Cmon man.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, our football this season (except against Spurs) has been reminding me of the end of Lampard's tenure. We cannot build an attack to save our lives – even against mediocre opposition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1396,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"If Aubameyang doesn't come up with goals for us he will lose a lot of credit. He has gone through Tammy, Oli and Lukaku without making one of them a consistent threat in his system. He now has Auba and if he doesn't start scoring goals then he will struggle to defend his future here. I hope he comes through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,But even if he only gets the season. Do we bring in another manager and then give them another £300m to build their team?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1398,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That's because Frank said this was a 3 year project in that second season. It was a shit string of matches after 17 games unbeaten and 5 clean sheets in the last 7 before the first loss came. People thought it was a teething period for the young new squad but Roman clearly said fuck that lol. Todd will only listen to the fans at this stage in his early takeover and I think Tuchel will be safe on that basis until the end of the season.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1399,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"yeah that was with an owner who had competence 

our current buffoon is interested in spunking enormous amounts of money on players we don't need

cucurella for 60m should be investigated for money laundering",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Every game we do well for the first 15 minutes and then they figure out what our one overlap move is on the wing and it is shut down for the rest of the game and we lose. It’s not hard to see that pattern and figure it out, and then there seems to be no other plan for our attack. That’s on Tuchel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Di Matteo has won the CL. And made it to four cup finals (as you’re seemingly including the CWC and SC).

Should we have backed him long term?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1402,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It’s hyperbolic that they are an incredibly small club that made us look smaller.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1403,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I honestly thought he would be the one to come in during half-time as we shifted formation. That’s where I questioned Tuchel mostly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know man I kind of disagree, they really only had that 1 real chance to score and they did, and it was done by 2 mistakes from Fofana and Koulibaly that should have stopped it due to bad position.

Without those mistakes they wouldn't have been close to scoring except the long shot saves but then you can compare those to our chances.

It should have been a draw as i said we didn't deserve to win/lose really. That's my opinion anyway but I get why you think we do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1405,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nope. I am looking to the replacement,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The whole dilemma is who would we get to replace Tuchel? Options are slim and this manager cycle has proven to be ineffective. So my best guess is they’ll let him stay on until end of next season regardless of performance. They‘ll have 1.5 yr to find and vet a replacement and prepare a smooth transition. If they fire Tuchel now or later this season, they’re going to be gambling on the assumption that a rushed decision of a new manager will be better, which is an unlikely decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It’s cause and effect. Players under stress and outside their comfort zone by reasons such as systems and tactics can and have always underperformed at every club.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1408,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So what should we do because other stuff doesn't seem to be very effective.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What's stopping us from getting talent like City's?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well I'm not using it as an excuse for Ziyech, I put the blame on Tuchel, because he shouldn't use players out of position like this. It's not like we were short on wingbacks or something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Literally laughed at him, and Ziyech just bangs it into the wall again lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ever since I heard about his issues with the national team, I’ve wondered how toxic his ego must be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1413,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think he was just super desperate to try and do something for the team or the fans. Instead, it looks like it has massively backfired. You could even see his performance was super forced and more expressive than usual. Trying really to whip in the perfect ball or to even meg a player in a take-on. It was a desperate performance from a player desperate to save his future. I honestly pity him tonight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1414,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They're both young. Jorginho is the vice captain; he's the one who should be stepping in to get Ziyech out of there.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1415,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You think Reece plays with zero ambition or desire?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tbf to reece he did seem to oppose it but ziyech was being to stubborn or so I believe,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"De Jong never wanted to leave, wasted time chasing that",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1419,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"lmfao ouch, can’t really defend myself now",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes you need to look at the context behind the G/A.

6 G/A against Norwich 
-3 G/A against Southampton 
-3 G/A against Leeds
-2 G/A against Watford 

It’s a bit shocking that he’s played 167 games for us and only has 4 goals that aren’t against non relegation clubs. Also he cannot assist from open play as seen through the fact that 90% of his assist tally has come from corners. 8 open play assists in 108 PL games is shocking.

 I don’t want to see him sold but if he’s our best player then we are truly in big trouble.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1421,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's the chelsea way, manager is always the 1st scapegoat",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don’t even blame him but if a team plays terribly across the board including with new and old players, you have to consider a manager change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Either you are lying or have memery loss who don't remember the lessons from previous managers regime.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They have become shit,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Most teams that sit back eventually get figured out. Especially when they go through personnel changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1426,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Loves to play 5 defenders at all times and his attack is just kinda left to the creativity of players and not really systemic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1427,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You don’t get it. If the player doesn’t believe in or have confidence in the manager’s match plan then they’re not going to play well. Confidence is huge. Some players struggle more than others without it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1428,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No but I can partly blame them not having any clue of what to do when near the goal on Tuchel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think it was both. It has to be systematical and tactical naivety as there’s no way that literally all our players but James and maybe Havertz just happened to have their worst game in the shirt. But in individual moments we lacked the technical ability to do anything good.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1430,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,
1431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He might have lost the dressing room. He has a mix of players that don’t want to play in this system anymore and new guys who are trying their hardest to execute the match plan. It’s so obvious I don’t know how you guys can’t see it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1432,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Guess all of these players (less Sterling and add Werner) were just as bad when they won the Champions League, too?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1433,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We lost 1-0 to Zagreb mate 😂 Shambles,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't have a solution, that's why I don't work in football lol. I just really hope he works things out because things are looking dire",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lay off the copium mate,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1436,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"agree, horrendous performance all around",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I mean Zakaria was loaned in for a reason. Aubameyang started and they came in at the same time so I doubt there's a good excuse. He could've started Jorginho/Kova and brought Mount on later. He could've also left Ziyech on the bench and brought in Gallagher or RLC on in a more advanced role.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"at the end of the day they’re a unit that we’re relying on to compete with the best teams in Europe, and Sterling is the only one who’s had two good games this year. If this is the level you hold Havertz to then good luck",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"the whole attack isn’t good enough, they haven’t been good enough the whole season, Kai may have been the best attacker but he still wasn’t good",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"he looked like 2012 Messi compared to Ziyech I suppose, I just don’t think anyone deserves any kind of credit or praise after that disasterclass",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ALL of them? even when they clearly weren't clueless before coming to chels?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1446,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prolly vs saints he was super bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We've been in this position since Michael Emenalo left. There hasn't been a clear transfer strategy. Managers came and managers left, but we've been stuck with players who don't fit an incoming managers style. 

Getting a DOF would be a priority, keeping Tuchel on despite the shitty results we get would be huge for the club. 

City didn't win the title in the first year, Chelsea won it that year. They finished second/third I think that year. Questions were raised about Guardiola. 


Liverpool won the league before Guardiola came in, but won the Champions league a few times. Klopp has been questioned about his prowess in the league. 

Tottenham and Arsenal could pip Chelsea to 3rd and 4th. 

At Chelsea we are still under the notion of let's fire the manager and get someone new for the results we need. 

To do what City and Pool did, we need TIME. This season we would not perform well and we'll mostly not win a title, but finishing 3rd is important for Tuchel to keep his job.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1448,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Totally agree. Lots of questions need to be answered. But it’s also on the players to perform. There too many new players to have some kind of grudge or fear of Tuchel. If anything, they don’t want to fail in order to live up to the high costs Chelsea paid for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,F,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It would be interesting to see Havertz in a structure like City's because I could see him excelling in that type of system. He would also be perfect to replace Muller for Bayern IMO. 

I do agree we need somebody like Rice whatever we do because I don't think I've ever felt our midfield has been super soild except when Kante was carrying it. Every other player is too limited in some way or another. I do hope Zakaria can be that person and find his BMG form quickly for us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1451,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"They play different roles, but they occupy the same position in a formation, i.e. central behind the striker. Mount fits the profile of attacking midfielder in a high pressing team, Havertz is a shadow striker. There aren't any normal formations that utilise both of these roles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1452,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought so too at first. Then I slowly believed that he cant be played there. He was also good at driving the ball forward two seasons ago, but like everyone else here, i have no idea what happened",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1453,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I remember that 70-yard sprint back vs Brighton on his debut to slide tackle and win the ball back (think he started as a RM in a 4231). Then slowly you started seeing Frank integrate him into a midfield 3 and he looked good. He just had one issue and it was that he was a bit slow in transition with his touch and turn but other than that he definitely had the read for the game as a b2b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1454,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[deleted],,,,,,,,,,,,,
1455,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"So when are we supposed to hold the players accountable? I’m fine with asking questions of Tuchel’s system - we all should. But we can’t absolve the players from these performances. At the end of the day, it’s on them to go out there and perform. I’m not seeing enough from these expensive and highly thought of players - they are really struggling with the basics at this point.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1456,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000% Just look at the other clubs he fell out with. This ALWAYS happens. I didn't expect it to be different with Chelsea.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I do agree that Mount has been poor this season but Pulisic has been for the last 2 seasons,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1458,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mount gets those opportunities because he is a better player, Mount has the ability to change the game with a shot from outside the box or a pass into the box. Pulisic ability is to run into the box (assuming he doesn’t miscontrol it) and hope the ball somehow goes into the goal",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1459,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"No, but if you look at the broader picture of the games we have played including last season. All players had stand out performances except for Ziyech and Pulisic",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1460,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I mean he could’ve let it fall and volleyed it? I can’t remember there was an immediate challenge on him that meant he had to head it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1461,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Okay, Pulisic had 15 minutes and 8 Minutes of added time to influence the game. The most memerabke thing he did was to miscontrol a simple pass. Cornet (West Ham player who just joined the club from Burney) in 10 minutes plus added time managed to hit the post create 2 chances and score a goal, which we have to agree should have stood. So Pulisic had plenty of time to influence the game. 

Now my question to you. When was the last time Pulisic was a game changer for Chelsea ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1462,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sorry, I guess cursing isn’t mature for the children in attendance.

He’s bad. Our entire attack is out of form but that doesn’t mean he isn’t bad. Just because he had a purple patch post-lockdown and he gets a pass from some biased American fans doesn’t change that.

Mature enough for you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sure mate,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1464,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The fact anyone is singling out someone who came on in the 75th minute and had like 4 touches should tell you how biased they are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1465,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yeah I’m sure some bloke on Twitter knows more about goalkeeping than a top flight keeper. If he stays back Orsic would’ve had the whole goal to aim at and slot it past him then this idiot on Twitter would be saying he should have come out. The fact he uses an example from the championship against a champions league game sums it up haha,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sure man, none of our players can pass at all, that's why we finished in the top 4 last 3 seasons in a highly competitive league and won CL the season before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Can't speak for the other guy, but I'm talking relatively. Tell me any of those 5 (kepa's only game I believe) have had a better game this year? We're playing out of absolute rock bottom. I'm just looking for positive signs and I saw them today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1468,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Well we can start with shutting down the narrative that Kai Havertz played well today... Jorginho also didn't look good. He didn't make any mistakes sure but he didn't make a crazy impact.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1469,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Coz in the other team 11 players had an excellent game,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, he played 5+ dangerous passes in a 20-30 minute cameo (can't remember what time he came on). 2 of his passes led directly to shots. 2 led directly to crosses from James",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1471,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Won all his duels and made 7(!!) tackles in 30 minutes...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1472,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Downing tools has happened a hundred million times in football, are you new to the game? It's very common when a manager's approaching the end, or if the players are protesting something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cucurella was a dumb signing agreed

would've made sense if we hadn't signed Fofana but I just don't understand why we signed him",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The fact that you’re actually comparing Di Matteo to Tuchel tells me everything,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1476,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fair enough dude. Personally I think you're being too kind on us. Zagreb executed their game plan perfectly and we weren't even close. That's what made the difference for me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1477,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think he should be sacked at all yet, it's stackable form for managers in the past for sure but we should wait. He's literally only just got in a bunch of his own transfers finally. Yes things looks awful right now and we absolutely should still have an identity but let's wait and see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,How come we were so good before the sanctions fucked us up ?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1479,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What doesn't seem effective? Backing the players and seeing the coach as replaceable? That's only won us the league a few times, won us the CL a few times... I'd say that's pretty effective. 

Everything depends on who's here. If we get a coach worth backing and keeping for 5-10 years, I'd love to do it. What we should do is evaluate our current position, our current staff, and make the best decision for the club. If you think, even after the last 12 months, that TT is still the best man to lead us forward, that's fine we just disagree. If you think we *have *to stick with someone because that's the only way to win, that's just straight up wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We buy like them but clown manager can't use them properly and regress them instead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My point is that it doesn't matter what his role technically was. He was in his preferred position of the pitch almost the entire half and was useless there. Whether he was rwb or not is completely irrelevant to how he played in those situations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sadly, this may cause issues in the locker room.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Then that means Ziyech is the designated FK taker and Reece was the one trying to force him off? Jorginho and Azpi forced Tammy off of penalties many times in the past so that can't be right.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I think he plays with both but in this instance, I think he showed a lack of leadership. If you want to be the future captain you don't look at a teammate and give a look of disgust at another's decision. You look at Ziyech in the face and tell him what you think. Compare this to Drogba and Lampard arguing over penalties. Those were the antics of leaders clashing. Couldn't imagine Frank just letting Didier take a pen and looking at Ballack like Reece looked at Mase. Looked immature imo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1485,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That's our mistake I guess.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,
1487,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1 W in 10,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1488,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Exactly. Plus it's easier to just pin the blame on one person rather than admit a complex problem is complex.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1489,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Do you remember? How many times have we seen our players give up on good managers,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1490,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Having wingbacks doesn’t meant it’s having 5 players at the back all the time… Chilly and Reece are midfielders when we have possession and can go as high up as the attackers. We transition to three at the back when we have the ball but go on. Pep himself doesn’t coach players in the final third. Sarri did it and it was something that was soon found out. You’re just going off ideas others love to shout,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1491,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We've literally not challenged for the title the last 5 years. And the last time we won was when we had prime hazard and Kante in the same team and we played a system which almost every team in the league struggled to cope with. 

We've had 4 managers since then who've all failed to challenge for the title. Have had 3 of them leave and the 4th won the CL ( a knockout tournament) but shithoused to a top4 finish the same season. Started well the next season and as soon as our wingbacks got injured. we fell flat and were somehow lucky to finish top 4 again. 

There are systemic issues without a doubt. But the players we have had absolutely lack quality that's a top PL team needs. Jorginho was our top scorer with 7 goals in one of the seasons ffs. This didn't happen even when we finished 10th under Jose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1492,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’m definitely not saying Tuchel got it right and he should definitely be under pressure given how shit we’ve looked, but some of these players did not look close to PL level today. Ziyech, Mount, Pulisic were so so bad",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1493,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,What do you suggest against low blocks like this then? None of our players other than James have shown they can consistently play dangerous passes against low blocks. None of our players bar maybe Sterling have the dribbling ability to break down a low block. Why would we go to a system that mitigates our best players passing ability and replaces it with a system that benefits attackers who can’t play a dangerous creative pass for their life?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tactically I don't see a concern but it can be possible that he lost the dressing room mentally/enotionally  They're not playing like they care,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1495,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"They’re going to be so excited when Tuchel spends another shipload of money on a completely different set of world-class players…then shocked and disappointed when they, too, turn out to be a bunch of duds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1496,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We can see it, but there is no manager out there better than tuchel. If this was Roman era he’d be sacked of course..maybe the players feel that way too. However it’s Todd’s era now, he gave TT a warchest of transfer money and it’s time for the players to buy in or see the door. Realistically if TT is sacked who would we even get? Zidane? There’s not many out there better than TT",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fulham is going to tell us a lot about this team,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RLC would be more suited for this physical game than Gallagher yeah. We lacked creativity once we went down, so Ziyech seemed like an obvious choice to fix that. And I believe Zakaria isn’t fit either. As for bringing mount on later, that would’ve been a good idea but hindsight is 20/20, he’s probably trying to get mount out of his funk without playing him in a league game. I’d imagine mount is on the bench for Fulham",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1499,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mate, there's no ""at the end of the day"", ""Sterling HAD two good games""...

We're talking about tonight's performances. Try to stay focused. As I said, [Havertz was far from abysmal tonight](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/62800323).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1500,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Maybe now the focus needs to shit towards the manager,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1501,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You’re definitely right about that. It was just a poor display from everyone. The only positives I have are before we conceded Havertz, Sterling, and Auba we’re linking well for their first start together. Everyone knows after we conceded our confidence is non-existent till the last 5 minute s",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1502,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean, he’s right you know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1503,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I see by ""soccer"" that you're American. I'm being completely fair about Pulisic, no need to patronise me. I want him to do as well as you do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1504,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I never said all of our players are clueless. We have a mix of of clueless and non-clueless players.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1505,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fair point! I don't disagree,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1506,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tuchel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1507,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He has looked like absolute shit on the flanks,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Correct. The Bruno/De Bruyne role for Mount. And Tuchel won’t play him in it, and that is costing the front three in a big way. 5-2-3 is a fucking waste. Worst set up for your best players. Just fucking be vulnerable and play some football with 4 at the back. Dreadful to watch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1509,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When a couple of players look far worse than their teammates, it's probably the players. When you lose to teams that are clearly more talented, that's an argument you need new players too. When almost your whole squad, (not even just today's XI) look worse than usual, and when you keep losing to teams with obviously inferior talent, then you have to look at the manager. Especially when they've had time to shape the team to their liking. I think Tuchel is a super smart guy I hope he can continue here, but this season especially he is not putting his players in a position to succeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Well yeah you just described the difference between a CM and a winger. The entire team was shit outside of 1-2 players, Mount and Ziyech were historically bad, and even if Pulisic was poor deciding he's the one to blame is mind blowing.

Hell Jorginho and Sterling were probably also worse, but somehow Pulisic gets the attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1511,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mount and Ziyech were fumbling opportunities like that the entire game, Pulisic misses one header and somehow he gets just as much attention. Your obsession with him is concerning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1512,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably the last time he performed well was when the coach showed confidence in him.

Edit - sp",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1513,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He's about as consistent as Kai has ever been for us if not better in total, and mount at this point this season has been worse cuz he's playing a lot more this season. And done more than Ziyech has done as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1514,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,John Harrison isn't just 'some bloke'. He is respected in the industry and does a lot of GK data analysis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ha haa, how many assists and goals our attackers or midfielders had from open play? One guy that had a good season is out of form and I said myself that Fullbacks can, what did the thers had, fucking nothing. But sure keep believing what you want lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He won 9/9 duels and made 7 tackles in 30 minutes...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1517,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bro...its Dinamo,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Fair enough,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nah not new. Just grounded. Your claim is baseless and going purely off of speculation from match performances. I’d give it time,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1520,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jinx,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1521,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"we are going to look at Tuchel's tenure like we do for Mourinho's second stint

ship out academy products and replace them with overpriced players that do the same job the academy players would have done

had we just kept Abraham, Guehi, Tomori, Colwill, Tomori we'd probably be in a better spot than we are after spending 100m on Lukaku and 150m on defenders...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1522,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Why wouldn’t I? They’re our two CL winning managers.

Should we have backed Di Matteo long term? If not, why should we back Tuchel long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I haven’t read anywhere than the purchases are TT chosen - can you provide your source please? Genuine query here,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lol how come any manager was good for a team at any point and then wasn’t? That’s the nature of the game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We weren’t? We haven’t really been good since the Juve game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everything the 18 teams that aren't Liverpool and City are doing given they've won the majority of the past 5 years of domestic trophies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1529,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I get that you love Tuchel bro, but having 5 defenders on the field, whether they are ""wing backs"" or not still means 5 defensive minded players on at the expense of offense. I'm not shouting any ideas I don't see for myself, every single offense player hasn't performed under Tuchel, but sure I'm just touting false narratives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1530,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It’s not like this would be the first time this has happened to a football club. It happens all the time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1531,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I have no idea. I’m not advocating for him to be fired. Just pointing out the pattern.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I guess we'll agree to disagree then. I still think Tuchel rightfully deserves some blame. He doesn't make the players make bad decisions or miss shots but he sure as hell makes the decisions on the tactics and who starts/gets subbed in.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1533,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"squandered our best chance for a goal by running into four players instead of passing or shooting, generational talent",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"agreed, the system is stifling some incredible talents",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1535,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"“Had time” - I think we have different definitions of “time” considering 3 of our last major signings have played 2 games, one half, or have yet to play. I think it’s clear the players need some time to gel, they barely know each other. You can’t just toss a bunch of expensive players and expect immediate and flawless results. And these players are being Individually outclassed by system teams, usually with an extremely specific style of defending and counter attack. The players buy into the system and play up for Chelsea. It’s not Tuchel’s fault that Havertz gives the ball up without a shot or pass, or ziyech can’t get his cross past the first defender or fofana doesn’t take down his assignment. Tuchel can only do so much, the players need to be better. Both need to be better. Tuchel needs to find a way to get more out of them, but this is hardly on only Tuchel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1536,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My obsession with him is that he has not been on Chelsea’s level. Neither has Ziyech. Both should leave the club,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1537,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He is getting paid £150k a week for fake sake this isn’t kindergarten with little boys. Where he should be patted on his back. It is his job to perform and if he is not performing he should be sold.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1538,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I don’t have any compliments for those 3 players either if the point of that comment was to use them to prop up pulisic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1539,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tuchel and Chelsea won that Champions League by dominating.

Dimateo won his with luck and he had Drogba, Lampard, Terry,Ashley Cole, Cech.

Silva is the only one on their level. Our backbone is full of young players. There is a big difference.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1540,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We have no director of football or technical director or advisers.  You think Boehly is picking these players??  He knows nothing yet about assessing talent or European football generally.  He's relying on Tuchel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1541,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Liverpool and City have Pep and Klopp. If they didn’t have Pep and Klopp, they would sack the manager if they got them in a terrible situation. Tuchel is not on Pep or Klopp’s level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1542,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,[removed],,,,,,,,,,,,,
1543,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don’t love Tuchel, the man pushed out Cho even though he doesn’t rate Ziyech leaving us thin. I’m just not shouting “5 at the back” and saying we are defensive when we aren’t. We dominate possession so we aren’t waiting to counter while we have two banks of four behind the ball. The system kept a ton of clean sheets and got us a UCL but sure keep going",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1544,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"oh its happened to us SO many times, im just saying its not a tactical concern solely",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bad times for us blues,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1546,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"While we disagree on tuchel’s blame, we definitely agree on the players not being good enough . Maybe it’s an attitude problem, cohesion with the new guys, or tactics. Fulham will be an interesting game",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1547,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A was still significantly better on the day than Mount and Sterling, what does that tell you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I completely agree that a manager can only do so much. I also agree that the new signings need time to gel, I've said as much on here. And I've also said we need better players. These are possible reasons why we are not competing with City, Liverpool etc...

But they are not the reason why we have played poorly in every game this season except one.  I can't look at this team and say that we are playing at our limit. The performances are very bad. I don't think anyone could even argue that 50% of our players are playing near their maximum. Maybe 3 or 4 out of the entire squad this season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1549,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neither has Mount.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1550,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I’m not apologizing for today’s performance, I was answering your question. If you think support from a coach and the system doesn’t matter I believe you are missing a very important variable in the equation.

The same thing goes for Mount, Ziyech, Havertz, Gallagher, etc - even Sterling has looked average outside of a few moments. They are all better players than what they have shown this year - what do you think the common denominator is? Do any of them look confident to you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean I was just saying it cuz you singled out the least impactful performance of them all and the attacker that plays the least in general, although ziyech is close",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yeah no problem at all - source please.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1553,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,But it is defensive. Keeping possession doesn't mean squat if it doesn't produce. Not one Chelsea offensive player has done well with Tuchel. Sure the defenders have the ball up the field but they are still defenders. I'd just like to see him maybe trade in a CB and play Kai at a 10 like he was born to play. There's too much quality in the squad to have ZERO attacking plan or fluidity and just sit there and pass it from one side to the next looking for a cross.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Agreed,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I personally think Tuchel has lost the dressing room which is why the effort is lackluster. Not excited for Fulham though...,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,With this comment your opinion is not valid anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1557,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, I believe personally that Tuchel has introduced to many signings into a system they probably have never played before at once. 

We should implemented these players slower, of course there would be a few exceptions like Fofana who has played in a back three for Leicester and Sterling who has played as an inside forward. 

It is hard for Tuchel to do anything since we will be playing 2/3 games a week until the WC. But we do have to separate weak mentality players and bench’s them until they get their confidence, and play with high Confidence players. We do have a 9-10 players who have high confidence and these players should start whilst others are slowly implemented into the squad",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1558,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The club have one of the most expensive scouting and data analytics systems in the world, they would have identified targets, Tuchel would have said yes or idk to them. Good thing is, they’re all good players and can play under any manager.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mount has been horrid so far this season. I wasn't saying he needs to leave, he's often the backbone of the squad. But looking at this game and blaming Pulisic and not Mount is just a level of mental gymnastics I can't understand. 

Mount and Ziyech unequivocally were a larger net negative in this match, but I'm not even sure you're able to admit that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1560,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't disagree with your points, at all. These guys - to a man - all make a lot of money and it's really disappointing that this team can't seem to perform.

I also agree with getting those players who seem the most confident out there as a group, which isn't necessarily the strongest 11 on paper. However, if TT doesn't find a system with some semblance of an attacking mentality (that gets forward with confidence rather than hold up play) and some consistency with putting guys in spots they can be successful, I think it will just keep going sideways, at best.

Rotating starts between players who are struggling isn't really helping, either. Give someone a string of a few games and see if they can put something together.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1561,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Are these the same group who scouted; Pullisic, Ziyech, Lukaku, Werner and co?

Granted these were before TT but it’s common knowledge frank didn’t want some of them either. Hence my question which nobody can actually provide a source that they are TT picks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
1562,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just to add since the news - I was right and he didn’t authorise them.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1563,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I am looking at a bigger picture, in which I am deciding that both Pulisic and Ziyech are below par for more than 90% of the time they play and should be sold immediately so their transfer fee and wages can be relocated to strengthening the squad",,,,,,,,,,,,,
