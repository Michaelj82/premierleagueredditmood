Absurd performance, especially defensively, immediately undoes any positive momentum from the City game. 

It looks very ominous with Forster right now as well. He looks beyond slow.

Our position in the league and champions league is quite remarkable considering we‚Äôve had so few good performances this season. Hopefully it gives Conte a chance to reflect and adjust things for the second half of the season.,"I agree with you on Pape Sarr, he had a few nice flicks and has strong ball carrying I was definitely impressed with him when he came on, he needs to get his loan or Conte use him a bit more than never letting him touch the pitch. 

I also liked Alfie Devine when he came on even though it was for 10 minutes he attempted to play a few tricky passes which I liked.

Bentancur",I love Bentancur,Worst performance of the season. At first it looked like Conte cared when bringing in basically our A team. But after conceding 2 goals it‚Äôs like everyone gave up.,"Imo unless we sign someone in January, if kulusevski isn't playing then Gil needs to play for 343 to work, yes he's still very raw but he's the only forward we have other than Deki who can  beat a man and his energy is always fantastic. If we do sign a back up then hopefully he gets a good loan spell, preferably not in Spain but a more physical league i.e Germany, England or Italy","We lost, but I at least had fun watching the 2nd half, and if we‚Äôre gonna lose, I‚Äôd rather lose like that than a helpless boring loss or a pathetic scoreless draw",I stan for Ricky Bentancur,"Conte's got to sort out how to deal with pressing sides, it's embarrassing how we crumble under any sort of press",Sick of waiting until the death to start fucking playing‚Ä¶,Awful awful performance.

Absolutely no quit. Playing to the final whistle. That says a lot about the resilience of the squad.

WITH THAT BEING SAID‚Ä¶ here are my thoughts:

1.	Kulu and Benta must be protected at all costs - they are absolutely world class and our attack is so much better with them clicking.
2.	Kane looks gassed. After the WC he needs to get subbed out earlier in certain games if we have guys healthy.
3.	Our back line is a mess. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ability, quality, or fitness, but we have given up too many goals that we shouldn‚Äôt. We need Romero back ASAP and we need to make some signings to rebuild.
4.	Biss looks more and more settled - I think after the WC he‚Äôs gonna be even more assertive (I can‚Äôt wait for him to score his first goal).
5.	Spence and Gil HAVE to start getting more minutes. 
6.	We won after I put on my Spurs hat at halftime. I don‚Äôt consider myself superstitious, only a little stitious.
7.	Thank God for 3 points.

COME ON YOU SPURS","I rarely bother commenting in post match threads when we lose because it gets pretty toxic and I‚Äôm not arsed moaning half the time,

Conte and the team should be absolutely ashamed of the performance today, there‚Äôs zero excuse for it",Son didn‚Äôt get the ball much but his touch looked good.

Some observations:

Skipp really has the stamina, his sprints during counter attacks are joy to watch

Skipp-Sarr combi is pretty good! They seem to complement each other

Spence had some good minutes, nothing special yet but he did all the basics right

It‚Äôs easy to be overly negative after a derby loss, especially at home, but I‚Äôm really struggling to see how we take any positives at all at the moment. 

Not sure I‚Äôm convinced Conte is here for a long term project, can‚Äôt see Kane staying much longer if Conte goes, Hugo looks well and truly finished, Son is yet to contribute this season. Those three have arguably been our best players since each of them came into the team and I‚Äôm a bit pessimistic as to how we‚Äôre going to replace them. 

It‚Äôs also a worry that the exits (if they happen) of Kane and Conte, and the huge drop off of other key players, leads to us not qualifying for the UCL which in itself could bring is trouble keeping hold of the likes of Romero and Kulusevski. 

Unless we miraculously pull something off in the UCL or the FA Cup this season, it kind of looks to me like our biggest achievement in the last 10+ years is going to be a couple of cup finals, and it‚Äôs getting increasingly harder to see where the next one will come from",Embarrassing performance all round,Win.

Conte watching on, not really making the changes youd expect from a manager of his caliber. So, he tells us our bench is shite, fine. Our players are shite for his system, fine. But maybe, Conte, it is time to look at yourself and think about how you can adapt to the tools at your disposal, rather than trying to square peg it.

\- Word on Tanganga, Skipp and Bissouma who had great showings. Skipp in particular was playing like Zidane reborn.

\- Danjuma very lively, he could be a real find. Potentially more great business from Paratici.

- Sarr is the real deal (prospect wise)

- Tanganga was very solid. Plays still die once they reach Emerson.
- Sanchez with the ball is terrifying. Has to be improved on in this or the next window. 
- Gil always feels like he‚Äôs right on the brink but never getting over the hump.
- White was getting bullied physically. Especially when trying to hold the ball up. A number of plays died because of this.

Sure his crossing is‚Ä¶bad. But he had a couple of reasonable ones and even a good one that nobody took a gamble on. Even his left footed cross from the left wasn‚Äôt all that bad.

The first goal though? Royal was so determined and so patient there and winning the ball back high like that immediately led to the goal. Most other players give up the foul there. 

The guy hustles and shows up in every phase of play all over the entire pitch. Even for Richarlison‚Äôs disallowed goal Royal was right there, sliding alongside him. He moves inside to help midfielders, covers defensively through the middle quite well, won back possession high several times. Literally all over the pitch he‚Äôs doing something. 

I think between his awful run of form last season and being not very good at classic wing-back stuff it‚Äôs easy to miss all the work and good things he is doing.

It‚Äôs way too simplistic to point to Sess and say he beat a man for pace and put in a good cross and since Royal doesn‚Äôt/can‚Äôt he‚Äôs not good.  I think the team would be worse if we also had a Sess clone at RWB."

- Son's dream comeback, Dier goal, first Benta goal, Kulu's mad cross.

- Kane's passing form seems much better, his goal-scoring record has been superb but his recent passing was horrible to watch

- Bentancur looked great, even without the goal. Could've gotten Son on another one. PEH was good, but not great. Still no verdict on Bissouma

- Short cameo from Son but looked much better than his previous stints, in regards to link-up play. 

- Vintage Son finish for the first two. You can't save that, even if they had a better keeper than the clown in Leicester's goal line. Don't know why the sold Kasper Schmeichel

- Much better attacking output overall, even before Son came on

- Happy Conte & Son

- Was an interesting game overall. Didn't check my phone that many times

- Gianni Vio lifetime contract incoming

- Lloris MoTM if not for Son

Negatives

- Murderous defense, think it was tactical more than the players. Second half was much, much better.

- Sanchez making mistakes

- Perisic was alright, very suspect defensively. Will give him a pass because he's playing on the opposite flank

- Same with Sessegnon, looked better when he switched back but still not great

- Richy's link-up play can be better, he's shown that he can assist and contribute. Think he needs some time.

- Rodgers won't be the coach when we play away at Leicester","It may seem disappointing now, but just wait until we cash in all this xG we saved up.",I‚Äôll take that fucking point.,One of the worst Kane performances I've seen in a long long time. Everyone was bad but his Lakaka-esque touches and over/under hitting so many passes were very noticeable.,"Not pretty at all.  I expected dropping points in a winnable game at some point, and I guess this was it (technically Chelsea was winnable, too).

As Bissouma's first start showed, It's becoming increasingly clear that adapting to Conte's system isn't as easy as plugging in a great player and letting them rip.  I don't think Conte wants the team to play like they did last season.  Last season's tactics worked amazingly when they did, but when it didn't, it really REALLY didn't.  Conte's pushing for something more complete, far less one dimensional.

So I'm patient.  I really am.  I see the path the team is taking, but dammit I wish this was faster.  And prettier, because... god that wasn't fun to watch.  The Players look out sync, there are weird mistakes left and right.  Even with the lack of subs, it felt like Conte saying ""play this one out and learn something from it, guys"" rather than a mangerial brain fart.

..... DESPITE everything we still got a point???","A few thoughts:

The football ain‚Äôt pretty but when was the last time we lost? Conte is clearly building a style of play in which we restrict our opponents to long shots and rely on world class forwards. And it‚Äôs working.

Son‚Äôs dribbling and shooting atrocious. But how hard did he work? His running and defensive contributions deserve credit. And without his blistering pace we wouldn‚Äôt have the red card and potentially wouldn‚Äôt have won.

Conte did well with his subs. Bringing on kulu to inject some excitement then many more to exploit the tired legs of 10 men. A very adeptly managed match. The guy knows what he‚Äôs doing. 

Richarlison was a fucking great buy.

Davies block at the end‚Ä¶wtf!","luv totnum

simple as","Perisic was brilliant given that it was his first start I thought. Had some minor mistakes. Should‚Äôve taken that shot on in the box, but was easily our most creative player while he was on the pitch.

PEH was impressive in nearly every aspect of the game. Great endurance and work rate. Rock in defense. Progressive in offense. Doesn‚Äôt do anything flashy, but a silent general.

Son would leave disappointed in himself. Had some chances. Did provide that corner that lead to Kane‚Äôs record breaking goal, which is a big positive. Form isn‚Äôt mid season level yet, but make no mistake, he‚Äôs still the same lad from last season. Brilliant pace. Two footed goal scorer.. and hungry. He‚Äôll come around. He‚Äôs had performances like this over the last few seasons, particularly in games where Kane‚Äôs *not* dropping deep to find Son on the counter. Still class none the less.

Richarlison‚Äôs showing that his style is a great contrast to Sons, in a good way. Provides a little more vision, strength and composure on the ball, while also giving us another solid header of the ball - all ideal qualities for a second half attacking sub, especially if you have the lead. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if Conte tries to tinker with that sub throughout the season, perhaps keeping Son on and subbing Richy for Kulu instead.. wouldn‚Äôt expect it nearly as often given the versatility we have on the left vs the right‚Ä¶. either way, every time he‚Äôs been subbed thus far he‚Äôs looked good.

This is a typical Conte match so let‚Äôs not overreact here. My personal takeaway is we instantly improved when Conte allowed Kane to drop into midfield allowing Royal/Perisic to make timed runs along with Son/Kulu and work downhill against the defense. Uber defensive in the first half, allowed more attacking freedom in the second.. which also opened it up for Betancur and instantly improved our quality in both off/def. Calculated approach from our manager imo.","Richarlison was an amazing signing. 

This guy is such a beast and gives Tottenham the flair and the edge they didn‚Äôt have before.

Our forwards are all top notch and once they gel together as the season goes on, scoring will come easier."

Yah.",Nice comfortable win over a mediocre mid table team,"Emerson MOTM for me. Defensively solid, good up front, and a surprising goal","We need new defenders this summer. We lost because of mistakes in defence, Leicester‚Äôs clinical finishing and none of our forwards turning up. Absolutely soulless today","If you told me the result ahead of time I don‚Äôt think it would‚Äôve bothered me, but knowing we were up 2-0 at half time. We had a clear objective: Defend. We completely imploded in 12 minutes to lose all 3 points. I know City are incredibly talented, but if we can‚Äôt even get a point when things go our way how are we ever supposed to get anywhere as a club?","Its almost like having a keeper who doesnt make howlers every game is a big thing for a team to be good.

happy new year all","Emerson was, no lie, phenomenal. Conte didn't ask him to cross or progress the ball, just hold it and distribute, then go inside. He looked so, so much more comfortable. That doesn't even mention his effort on defense, as well.

Stevie Wonder can see this shit first half, second half tactics aren‚Äôt working. We played well second half because they could allow us too with being 2-0 up. Same as Brentford and Bournemouth. He has to take blame for today, setting us up again to lose the midfield battle is just pure suicide. Getting sick of these manager types, Conte, Mourinho same styles, it‚Äôs stale and boring, and they whinge, I need ¬£70m players, Eddie Howe has fucking Dan Burn left back and Sean Longstaff, Joelinton and Willock in midfield and play football ten times better than we do.","Conteball is not a reason I became a Spurs supporter.

The Doc a great showing head and shoulders above any other full back on show although I think Emerson was told to mind the house for most of the game as he offers nothing offensively.
Harvey White struggled and found it near impossible to get into the game. He will never make it in that position so not sure why he was picked there. Surely Alfie Devine should be there and showed promise when he came on.
Sarr showed excellent touches and long strides that will make him a gem in the future",I‚Äôm honestly not that disappointed. We played great second half.

I never complain about this shit, but in this case it's so fucking disgustingly obvious that I have to.

Not sure how we‚Äôre going to break our trophy drought when we don‚Äôt take gifts like this, really embarrassing stuff.","Said it in the match thread, but this kind of game is usually one we lose our heads in a bit and get rattled. But we stepped it up today and took on the physicality and shithousery and even the ref being an absolute gronk. This is the kind of mentality you can build a run in to the end of the season on.

Big ups to Emerson busting lungs up and down the flank all day, Skipp looking like a man possessed and stepping out well to press all game, and Romero having ice in his veins and loving fucking up Chelsea players. Loved watching this one.","That Davies performance was reminiscent of Jan vs Dortmund.

Would love to see what Benta and Bissou can do together. Give the Viking a rest!,"Game after game it‚Äôs the same story, and yet Conte does absolutely fuck all to change it.

Honestly that was so bad to watch both tactically and on the pitch completely inept. Not a single postive to take from that. This is not a team challenging for anything and we'd be stupid to think otherwise. 

The players and coaches should hang their heads in shame after that. What do we even do on the training pitch. Nothing at all looked right.

No Premier League team should be conceding that many chances. Our midfield was hopeless at doing anything but running around like headless chickens. Their ability to press and win tackles led to our defenders coming out to tackle and then we just got caught out. And yet we learnt less as the game went on. Pathetic.",,I need a cigarette,"Want to bring some mild positivity. Game was mostly going according to plan until Emerson got sent off. The goals were a screamer from an unlikely source and a bit of a blunder by Lloris. The counterattacks were just a bit off and I do think the defenders seemed a bit too scared of the Arsenal attackers. In terms of the season, we now have two of our most difficult games (away at Chelsea and away at Arsenal) done with, frankly, one more point than I expected. As long as we take care of business in the home Big 6 games and against teams we should beat, we'll be totally fine.","Bissouma Masterclass.

He plays every single minute seemingly and it shows.",Conte bout to call in a mob hit on Tuchel,"My read: There is not much any team can do when their stars are just not playing well. Kane and Son have not linked up this season yet. The sub is more than aware of Son's struggles, but I think the goals Kane has scored have helped him mask is otherwise below average play (for him). Most of the time it's ok if your star striker only scores goals, but Kane's distribution is a vital part of the tactics at the end of last season. 

On top of that Conte seems to be uncomfortable subbing off Son and completely unwilling to sub off Kane when there is not a strong lead.

I agree with much of the criticism on here in general, but no team, not even the great Barcelona of a decade ago, could play well when their top players are so out of form. Even City looks considerably worse when De Bruyne is out injured or out of form.","Well, that was definitely one of the games we‚Äôve played all season.",Start strong and lose it completely in the second half.

We are perfectly fine letting other teams fight and win and hope that they screw up so we score.

Positives:

* Skipp getting some minutes in his legs after so long.

* Son, Kane and Richarlison were threatening while they were on and worked pretty well together.

* Bentancur had a good game even when outnumbered in midfield.

* Hopefully this is the last we see of Emerson for a while. Conte will be absolutely fucking furious about how pointless and stupid that challenge was.

Cons:

* Romero had a shocker. Hopefully this doesn't become a trend.

* Lloris had a bad game, but wasn't as poor as everyone is saying.

* Conte persisting with the 3-4-3 for one of the most critical matches of our season is a worrying sign, although hopefully he will switch to 3-5-2 after this even if it's just because he doesn't trust Sess like he trusted Emerson (for some reason).

* There's a risk that Emerson still starts when he comes back from suspension.",Matthew Doherty. What a man,"goosebumps at only one Gian Piero

Not great, at times frustrating, but it felt at 1:2 down like we were still in with a chance of getting something. Son had a few decent runs, Richy needed one decent cross... But then Emerson changed it all (too many studs for a yellow, fine, but I dunno, it felt a harsh red) and Conte made 5 subs to shore up a 1:3 loss, killed the game. Onwards. But Christ, please try a 3-man midfield.","Bissouma really settling into that holding midfield role, looks far better

i‚Äôve also gotta find that picture of the him, H√∏j, and Bentancur celebrating after the goal","Tactics were amazing, Hojbjerg were amazing. That‚Äôs what we love to see

I'm not gonna try to be the negativity police.

The only stream I could find was a French broadcast, and I kid you not, even though my French is really bad, I understood that the 2 French guys were fucking laughing about us... On live air! Around the 66th minute. They said something along the lines of how are spurs so high up the table and started laughing out loud.",,It's Never Easy FC,"I felt like before the red card we had a great chance to get a favorable result. 

Unfortunately, Emerson‚Äôs lapse of concentration and getting sent off completely fucked us. If there‚Äôs any consolation then hopefully Djed Spence may get an opportunity to impress. I fully expect Conte to play Perisic at RWB with Sessegnon at LWB in our next match against Frankfurt.

I was fine with the defensive subs that Conte made today. After Xhaka scored with 10 men on I felt the game was gone from us and we needed to shore up the defense and protect our players from injury.


Bissouma, Doherty, and Skipp got minutes to build fitness. Hopefully they can give us options with our next run of fixtures coming up.","Thoughts

1. Bissouma
2. Rodrigo
3. I enjoy seeing Ryan Mason on the sidelines sharing the passion with Conte and the other coaches.",7 months unbeaten at home? Thank you very much.,"I‚Äôm nothing if not a jaded, cynical, revenge-hungry spurs fan‚Ä¶ relegate them into oblivion!

Nice one Sonny","We had so many chances, how did we not score man. We had to be winning this","Richarlison completely changed the game, get fucked Chelshit.",What does Doherty have to do to start a match,"While we didn't show up.

Our last two visits to this stadium we came out with 0 points. So it's an improvement.",The kulusevski sub really changed the game.,Sonny will come good. He is world class. I like the fact he looked pissed off. Its hard to watch us in the first half of games though. I‚Äôm hoping Conte will start mixing up his starting line up and perhaps making some subs before the 60th minute.,If we get 3 points in the games we don‚Äôt play well‚Ä¶ imagine how many points we‚Äôll get in the games we do,Can I end a matchday not stressed out please. Would be nice.
21,"As much as I love to rail on Levy for his blame‚Ä¶this week is on coaching staff, 

They rotate the squad to lose horribly too Sheffield in a game they admitted the attitude was wrong, almost like they didn‚Äôt care about advancing to the quarters, instead rotate and hope to play well this weekend


The first half was fine, tactically ok first 45. Second half wolves make a formation shift and dominate from minute 46 and our first sub isn‚Äôt until after 75? 

Playing perisic in 2 must win games when the guy crosses to the other team and has worse positioning than a 5 year old‚Ä¶",It just keeps happening.,AGENT 007 HAHAHAHAHA,angry benched Sonny is best Sonny,That‚Äôs the Spurs I know and love ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Go and win the league City,"I think I‚Äôm done with Conte now. A lot of football still to be played but there‚Äôs no signs of life. He didn‚Äôt to take the job and ended up setting probably against his better judgment. We‚Äôre not a good fit and there are no green shoots.

Arsenal are much better than us and we have some mitigating injuries but there are just far too many persistent ref flags with poor wingbacks, two in midfield, not getting started until there‚Äôs too much to do and just such little attacking nouse.

Conte doesn‚Äôt have ideas or willingness to change things until there‚Äôs nothing at stake. He‚Äôs not at fault for Lloris throwing the ball into his net or Sess dropping a 4/10 but he is culpable for the other 9 players playing like a team of ringers.

Secondly, Kane is gone, and we should stop planning our future around placating him. Mourinho, Nuno and possibly Conte have all set us back significantly, Conte less so because of the end of last season, but it was touch and go.","Conte hasn‚Äôt been great, but we have so many poor players who make massive individual fuck ups all the time. 

ENIC try to splash cash on a big name manager instead of properly funding the team. Being 6th now soon to be 7th in wages and transfer fees isn‚Äôt it. 

You have the most expensive ticket in the league an a fucking EMBARRASSING wage bill. 

There is nothing hard to figure out what the fuck is wrong. The talent isn‚Äôt fucking there.","Credit where it's due, Emerson was very good today",A much needed confidence boost for the lads.,"- The most predictable positive thing was the classic Ivan Peri≈°iƒá cross that led to Harry Kane's signature header. 

- idc that it's too early to call it but Bryan Gil is just 1 ""Ankara ~~Messi~~ Gil"" away from being a Tottenham legend in my book. I'll even get on the overhype train for the dude.

- We didn't concede in 1st half, AND performed a solid 2nd half.

- It feels good to have a good RWB. Doherty <3.

- Pape Matar Sarr was solid.

- Sonny ended his goal drought. i bet it felt great to rip off that mask.

- 3 saves for Hugo Lloris. Some acrobatic saves as well. Clean sheet!

- 4-0 win away match (without Kulusevski, Bentancur, & Richarlison)

feels good man.","Really miss bentancur today, bissouma and hojbjerg had at least 10 turnovers combined from heavy touches and bad passes. Kulu and perisic looked really sharp today though which is a good sign","Hopefully this inspires Conte to trust Spence more. He didn't lose the ball once, recycled possession well, made some good runs and... ahaha who am I kidding it's back to the bench for another 2 months.","Last minute FC.

I'm sure I'm beating a dead horse but wanted to get it off my chest...

I know we're 3rd in the table and I shouldn't moan, but man, we're playing some dreadful-looking brexitball. What the hell happened to the football we were playing at the end of last season?

I understand that right now, we don't have enough talented players who fit Conte's mold, so does that mean that we have to keep playing this dreadful style until 3 or 4 successful transfer windows have been completed? (I doubt Conte will be here by then) 

Watching this team, I can't help but think the current style neutralizes our best players' strengths. For example, by now everyone and their mother knows Son should not be played alongside Perisic (and vice versa) - the two players' styles are incompatible and create zero synergy - yet time and time again, we see Conte trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. At what point does the man go back to the drawing board and experiment with something else?",MY BOY MATTHEW!,We just took 3 points against the 4th team in the standings.

Terrible game management. The players were fucking shattered, he made one sub but still insisted on trying to play on the counter. Fucking suicide. Got lucky to even get a point there.","It's a good win for sure. Richarlison scores, PEH provides yet another monster assist, but it's shocking how bad the standards of officiating we have. Imagine paying 500 quid for a CL ticket only to watch a referee spend 25 minutes trying to force a 0-0 draw after a red card. Right after we scored we were suddenly allowed to make tackles again, suddenly the OM players were told to get up and get on with it. Genuinely shocking and that's not even counting the myriad of decisions that were genuinely wrong and two Tottenham counters he stopped on his own by getting on the ball.","I feel like people are just remembering the underwhelming first halves we‚Äôve had this season and forgetting how good we‚Äôve been in the seconds. We had so many breakaway chances this game and honestly could‚Äôve had 4-5 goals. Seriously Kane could‚Äôve had four; he missed a clear breakaway in the first half, and missed a pen. We also were pretty dominant in the second half of the Wolves game. We‚Äôve been a really high-scoring team overall since the start of ‚Äò22, the goals will undoubtedly keep coming imo",Sonny has merely sacrificed a little of his power to allow Harry to score in August.

Absolutely agree that these were terrible conditions to play with, but it's just poor how we played, we looked dead. Players need to ask themselves on how they managed to let 28 attempts. 

Conte is also to blame for this game, limited by options but still didn't make rotations. Tactically we were wrong, our defence that we pride ourselves on in absolutely disarray. 

Also fuck Bruno Fernandez and dumb fucking face. I hate him the most.",,We want justice for Gil! He deserved a goal there!,"If the Sporting game wasn‚Äôt enough, I PRAY this game serves as a wake up call to both squad and coach that these kind of performances cannot continue.

I feel like Son hasnt had as many opportunities with the new formation and Kane more often sitting up top but hopefully this game allowed Sonny to build more chemistry with the other creative players we have.

What‚Äôs way more disappointing is seeing that Arsenal are the real deal. Usually in a game like that we shithouse our way back in claw back a goal on the counter or maybe even get a point as they crumble. But they played like a Ferguson team then where once you were behind you knew they were not gonna relinquish any control of the game. 

I‚Äôve never been a believer in the winning/big club mentality thing before. But it‚Äôs plain to see. Arsenal have done what we did with Poch and actually made it work. United and Newcastle have got their shit together too. There‚Äôs clearly something innate in those clubs where they can rise to the big occasion and go on winning runs. Seems like we can only win big games when nothings expected of us and the stakes are low cos everyone‚Äôs already stopped caring or usually when the opponent are beset by misfortune. Yes ENIC are a basket case who can‚Äôt stick to any plan with conviction when it comes to running this club and yes Conte is not getting the best attacking returns out of these players but ultimately we should be part of the story in these big 7 games and take control not just be an also ran who sometimes capitalise on others misfortune. We had the individual quality on the pitch today to at least put up a fight. Even in the peak Poch and Redknapp eras I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a spurs side play like Arsenal did today - assured with the belief in each other and the system to see out a win. Maybe once you could blame the wealth disparity in the PL or our commitment to attacking at all costs for not getting over the line but when you strip that away to the last few years where ENIC have been making big calls and bringing in the defence first managers and clearly in the top 7 wealthiest teams in the country it‚Äôs embarrassing how much this club is cursed in the PL era. Games like today just tell you there‚Äôs no point. Feels like you could change everything about the club, new ownership, new manager, new squad and we still wouldn‚Äôt win that game - the other top 6 clubs are in another league. Even if we get everything right we‚Äôll still be spursy old Doctor Tottenham there simply to be a gauntlet to pass for other clubs to prove they‚Äôre the real deal - while never being the real deal ourselves.

These are the same problems we had week 1 and there is no reason we should lose 2-0 to a relegation team.,"Same, literally he got on and the referee whistled","Sooooo fucking frustrated. Not really because of the loss itself, but im sour bc that was probably the best half of football we played all season and we had nothing to show for it , PURELY down to 2 cheap goals conceded in the first. Without dier‚Äôs mistake, we were pushing for a winner, not an equaliser.

Negatives: Ref was a fucking clown and I hate the overall quality of refs in this godforsaken country.

Emerson starting - I know it sounds like scapegoating but I honestly feel more secure and see more attacking prowess when Doherty plays. always seems to find himself in and around the box when necessary. Still waiting on spence, he was mega last season.

Defensive reliability - kinda speaks for itself, preventable goals at preventable times. Our defence is rocky at best tbh. 

Positives: Good football all throughout the second half. Sustained pressure, which we haven‚Äôt really done in many matches this season.

Deki. Took 60 fucking seconds to show why we need him in this squad.

Lenglet was quite solid today. Dier, although completely at fault for the second goal, created chances when he pushed up and really should have got one back. Bissouma looked somewhat like his old self again at points during the match. That fear of driving seems to be leaving him. Perisic still got a wicked cross on him, seemed to be running circles round TAA in the second half. Definitely not a bad player, but not really at his best, especially when he plays w/ sonny.

Overall annoyed bc right as things are starting to look up, we go on a break for the WC. Match was 100% winnable but we always gotta make it harder for ourselves. I want to see changes in squad selection from Antonio but afraid nothing will change. I am incredibly grateful to Conte for what he‚Äôs done to the club over the past year but until he brings in everyone he wants/needs for a squad turnover, we‚Äôre looking like we‚Äôre stalling.",Gianni Vio saves the day,"Rodrigo Bentancur is class . We are blessed to have a player like him at our club.  He reminds me a bit of Modric and Dembele. 

Our performance today wasn't good at all and silly mistakes like what we did today is costing us matches . Also Conte needs to come up with a plan to help us do good against teams that decides to press against us.

Cuti and Hojberg were outstanding.

Davies LWB has potential, Perisic's lack of pace on LWB hurts us.

Son can still produce if he has the space, which he's not getting in the current Conte system. Especially with Perisic at LWB

3. The main thing I have noticed in Kane since Conte came in is he has started to attack corners again. The guy has got his hunger back.

I wonder if Conte has been working with him on his defensive positioning and being willing to play simple passes instead of always running forward. There were quite a few times when he looked to take someone on, seemed to have a pause and a think and then played a simple pass. If so then these 10 minutes were probably exactly what he needed to show Conte. 

Sarr is fantastic. His slender build is almost an asset when it comes to easing a player off the ball with a slight nudge to the back. Bissouma always knocks his man over and picks up a yellow. Sarr does it with such grace and elegance. 

Tanganga looked a bit overeager, but also I think that‚Äôs what Conte wants from his wide CB anyways.

Him staying high on the left all the time is harmful, when attacking it'll push the defensive line slowly and it'll make every opponent we face seem to sit deep, when defending he can't help the defense because he's too far. An LWB should be taking that space by surprise, not by staying there all the time.

I do happen to know Devine due to FM and was hoping to see more of him rather than White. The minutes he put in were promising though. 

Gil needs to stop running into traffic and losing the ball, it‚Äôs reminiscent of Moura at times. He‚Äôs got a good dribble in him, but the lack of game time is apparent in his decision making.

Above all tho Levy/ENIC has to start spending, no reason our bench should look like this after only a few injuries, Conte doesn't even have any options if he needs to chase the game, and if they aren't gonna back the manager then just sell the club and pocket the billions in profits that they're gonna get","Royal really is so solid defensively, put Romero as CCB and Royal as RCB ü´£","Sanchez pulled up at the last move and grabbed his hip, lets hope hes okay and they get a CB this window.",A clean sheet? A wingback scoring? A wingback assist from a cross? How many youngsters playing?

Royal should never have been starting, has to have been Doherty. And one of Lucas or Deki had to start (maybe Lucas if Deki can't play 90 atm).

We cannot continue to play this poorly in the first half of every single game, and this lies with Conte's team selection not the players imo.

I think Lenglet and Bissouma were very good today. And Deki is obviously pure class.",RODRIGO FUCKING BENTANCUR,"we could have man city‚Äôs squad and the second they put on a spurs shirt, they‚Äôd turn to jelly babies",does it not matter if it‚Äôs off a defender ???,[deleted],,I'll take it but I can't help but feel devastated that Bryan isn't on the scoresheet.,"Im not going to overreact to this.

And was there even a VAR check for the hand ball before half time?",I hope chelsea fans stay mad abt this for a long time because i fucking despise chelsea.,"Everyone needs to give more, but that one is on Conte.

Would have been perfectly fine with a point away today. This one hurts a bit more.","Poor showing but glad to take the point away. Remain in a good spot on the table. Son getting a lot of grief for an August slump when Kane has struggled in August for as long as I can remember. Hoping we can stay behind the team and retain some of the enthusiasm from the start (um...we're 3rd in the table with no losses?).

COYS",Pru Pru!!,throw deki on a hamster wheel and he could generate enough electricity to power all of england. man does not stop running,"Kind of like last game, they were pretty rough at times.  This sounds a little weird, but these games feel a bit like we‚Äôre still playing preseason, experimenting with stuff and giving the whole squad chances to learn the system.  They‚Äôre not totally there yet, but slightly more together than last match.

Then again, that‚Äôs pretty much what Conte said before the season: have patience, the team needs time.  Regardless of how much time they need or how bad they might look in certain parts of the games‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre still getting points anyway???

EDIT: That set piece looked like a volleyball score. Setter Perisic.  EDIT2: now I want to rewatch Haikyuu","Outside of Lenglet and Romero both giving us far more options to build from the back, I want to shout out Dier who you could see played far more aggressively in possession. Rather than dropping back to offer a passing option, he was consistently pushing up into midfield and trusting Lloris to be the option in the back. It really gave us a lot more options to beat the press and he also had some great long balls out to the flanks."

Can‚Äôt you tell?

What Tottenham? Love Tottenham, Tottenham are great.",Give it to Stellini,"This is my Conte out moment. Yes, we have shit CBs. Why do we let them get exposed so much though? Why is the plan to sit back, concede possession, and then be predictable on the ball if our CBs are this shit? Why expose them even more? I don't get it. This might work in other leagues but the prem is too physical to play like this. Most clubs enjoy having possession and the ability to play balls over the top. Not to mention we are so easy to press because everyone knows what we are going to do on the ball.","Anyone else 100% confident we were losing that game despite being 2 up at at half time? Never expected anything but a second half collapse. 

This team just isn‚Äôt capable of 90 minutes against a decent team without giving up multiple goals.

Genuinely an incredible feat.,"Was always going to be a bit annoying-you knew Preston would sit deep and really stifle us. But a few moments of brilliance for Son which hopefully gives him confidence, a debut goal for Danjuma, and in the end, a comfortable win and progression.

The stadium was roaring after the penalty save and Forest has one momentary surge in them.  But after that (just before min 70) they clearly ran out of energy.  Their press went from withering to weak and their closing down was greatly diminished.

So.  Did we invite them on with the backpassing or was it all Forest pressure?  Wish we had good insight on what Conte wants because either Spurs passed themselves into pressure or maybe they were spreading Forest out in order to slice through and cause breakaway opportunities.   

No matter the cause, Spurs need to get better and breaking the press.  Sanchez and Royal were OK but this needs to get better.  Also, several missed connections that could improve.

Back to normal operation I see.","Absolutely massive win, no Dr. Tottenham today for the blue scum",I love you sonny,Tanganga-Dier-Davies backline should‚Äôve been enough to make me skip this eye broccoli and sleep in.,"The timing of ENIC looking to sell is horribly misaligned with where the club is at in terms of play. They desperately need to embrace a short term reset but that's completely at odds with trying to sell the club at the highest value.

I genuinely think they brought Conte in with that in mind. Hire a win now manager to keep Kane and be competitive enough to look as attractive as possible to potential buyers.

Even if Cone is capable of building something back up ENIC isn't going to have the patience for that right now and frankly I don't think Conte will either. They need to embrace some painful times to get a proper direction going but that's completely at odds with getting the highest value from a sale and that's assuming you actually get the right manager in the first place. It's a really ugly position to be in.","Tactics were dreadful. Son has lost his confidence. Sarr was the only bright spot. Conte won‚Äôt make it through 2023 I assume. Arsenal were better all around.

Should have switched formations at half. Kane can‚Äôt be playing in our half and sometimes our deepest player. We have no outlet and lose every second ball.

Kane",Anyone else just really bored watching Spurs?,Another point picked up off last seasons fixtures!,Second half fc. We move,Can we see bissouma from the start pls,"Just some thoughts:

\- Tottenham tried to stretch the play wide when building an attack. Saw Royal & Perisic come into the half space position multiple times while Kulu & Sonny remain wide.  
\- Benta & PEH tried to pull Moutinho & Nunes closer to them & create some distance between them & Neves by dropping deeper & closer to our CB's while building attacks. I think the hope was so Neves would be confused to man mark either Kane or another Tottenham in each of his sides.  
\- I knew that A Bola - a Portuguese media - reported that one of our scouts was watching the Lisbon Derby between Benfica & Sporting which Sporting won 3-1 where Nunes scored & assisted one. I think he's going to be a good signing for Wolves & hopefully Tottenham still keep an eye on him because I think he's quality. Also like the story from the Athletic that even when he's already playing professionally, still has a job in his bakery until he was sure he didn't need that second job.   
\- Tight game with needed of creativity, having another calm & composed player in Perisic is very very appreciated.","Things I noticed in the game - 

1. **This** was Conte ball.
2. We should have won by 5 goals, and any other day we would have.
3. I hate to say this, but the change from Sanchez to Romero was what lead to the performance today. 
4. We subbed off Kane and Son and were left with n attack of Deki, Richarlison, and Perisic. When did we become the sensible team?
5.  At this point, I am 70% sure the curse meant for Mbappe by the witch doctor somehow deflected to Son.
6. Richarlison is fitting in so well with the team, feels like he has been a part of the team for ages. 
7. I am getting too excited for the season now."

Take a few tough years like Arsenal did and incrementally back a project manager.

That was an embarrassing performance today. I can‚Äôt believe what I just watched,[deleted],I really hate how some refs refuse to give another yellow to a player who's on a booking for clear yellow card challenges. Pahlinha should have been sent off twice in the second half.,"I know we‚Äôre all freaking out about the Fab Bomb, but side note: watching the Atalanta v. Sampdoria match and Winky actually looks decent! Glad he‚Äôs getting a run in the starting lineup","God, what a relief this is. Kane is OP, Gil effective, Doherty great, Sarr a lovely touch, Son smiling. Romero doing madshit stuff running up the field on the press. I'm good for the night üëç","If the team is going to play this way for the first half, Spurs need to be better defensively and avoiding errors on the ball.

I see how the opponent can't keep the pressure on for 90 minutes and Spurs are fresher at the end of the game.  But shipping early goals need to be fixed.","Wins a win, didn't look great but we never really looked like we were gonna concede which was great.

Where my Gil Truthers at?
The kid is the real deal, looks so good, Deki will still be first choice but IMO we don't need another RW this winter, I don't see any reason not to keep Gil as the backup there.

Gil, Sarr, Devine, Deki, Bentancur.
Honestly, future looks really bright about now.","Kane played so well tonight. Despite playing in a system that gives him no real service, he used his strength immensly well to hold the ball up and bring others in, he used his gile and sportsmanship to win fouls. He is so underappreciated in this sub because even when not scoring, he has the other aspects of centre-forward play nailed down. Absolute class.

Bentancur is also a fucking hero tonight, they all are for that second half. I feel that when it's such a big occasion, such a hostile atmosphere, and a real do or die situation, it is often the players who play with character and heart who shine through, and Bentancur has been the epitome of that since he's settled here for me. Obviously very technically gifted, but he absolutely had the bit between the teeth second half and never fucking gave up. Even after his hamstring concern, he's there making runs up the pitch, pressing hard. Just such a fucking privelege to have him at the club.

We need to sort out this weird theme of being shit first half and unplayable second half ASAP, but it's weirdly reassuring to see that we can collectively play at a very high standard. After the first half against tonight (and against Bournemouth) I think a lot of us were worried that we weren't simply playing poorly, but that we actually just are a shit team. That's debatable, but to see us so confident in this environment tonight is proof that we have serious levels. It's just about consistency.","We might be a joke sometimes, but at least we're not Juventus","I mean we were terrible, absolutely abysmal, no excuse.

PEH was atrocious, and Bissouma anonymous, allowing the Rat to dictate play. I thought Dier was poor too as Rashford gave him a torrid time.


We seemed to be back-peddling on second ball which was infuriating and then that was coupled with poor decision-making with the brief chance we had the ball. I honestly have no idea
how tactically we looked so good/composed against Brighton, and then we turned in that shit-show tonight. I'll give that the players didn't stop running, and Lloris was half decent, but they were off one tonight.

There was not determined to be a foul on Havertz. The linesman and main ref were right there. Replays showed that the defender got a toe on the ball. But all of this is irrelevant because not only did the goal happen almost a minute later, but Chelsea even had another possession before it was scored. 

Their better argument was that Richarlison was active in an offside position on that goal but he had a defender smack in front of him so that's a weak argument as well. 

The hair pull in the box was just missed but VAR can only punish that if it was a red card. It wasn't. For those of you that argue that it was, please point to me to a men's senior professional game where hair pulling on its own(not as part of a larger fight) was given a red card. I've never seen it. So the ref screwed up on not seeing it as it happened, but like tugging on a shirt or shorts or wrapping your arms around somebody those sorts of fouls are missed on corners all the time. 

And finally, with as shit at Tottenham played on the ball, Spurs still put more shots on target than Chelsea. There was no intention to possess the ball. It was hit on the counter. Better effectiveness in passing there and maybe Kane putting away that sitter and it could've been 3 points.",Here's the wakeup call. Let's see if they actually wake up,"Just not good enough.  Darn.

Thought we should have had fresh subs come on.

That short phase of play where it seemed Hojbjerg was hurt was awful and played a part in the goal.  He wasn't closing down, West Ham controlled the game, the midfield got compressed way back and it almost seemed like the team was distracted waiting for a sub (or as it turns out, a new shoe.)

After his risky tackle early in H2, Bissouma had to pull out of challenges the rest of the game and it wasn't good for the team.

Emerson MOTM for me, his defense was on point - as well as the much needed goal. This match also proves (as if it wasn't obvious) that Son works absolute best when his back isn't facing the goal, seeing him and Kane link up like they always have in the past was pure sex.

I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how anyone can watch this team and want Conte to stay. Yes, this backline is absolutely shambolic, but his personnel decisions are so bizarre. What has Tanganga shown that Davinson, someone who has come in and deputized very well recently, shouldn‚Äôt start?  How on earth is Son staying on the pitch for 90 minutes, when he literally did not make a right decision all game? Are we going to continue to tank our season because Son was good last year? Conte does not ‚Äúreward‚Äù players for playing well. The subs and lack of subs he made today were comical. I‚Äôm shocked he hasn‚Äôt lost the dressing room yet.

This doesn‚Äôt even go into how dogshit he is at rotation. Our team is run into the ground because of his inability to ‚Äútrust‚Äù players. He is the only manager I can think of who has this problem. How come he can only trust 8 players in our entire squad, yet other managers seem to make it work?

His tactics are also absolutely terrible. They aren‚Äôt fun, nor are they effective. It‚Äôs glorified hoofball. This Leicester team isn‚Äôt even good, yet they just made us look like a Championship side. I feel like I can count on two hands how many times I even saw their goalkeeper on my screen, let alone a shot on target. Take away set pieces and it is even worse. I get jealous of watching other teams actually try and attack, meanwhile a minor press will force us to be so reserved that the ball can go from the opponents box all the way to our GK and eventually out for a throw in.

Player of the season already and its not even close",Gil is pathetic too. Completely bullied off the ball. Young players in the squad aren't that exciting atm. Which is a worry.,Bryan just comes back covered in oil,"Been the same story the last 7 games:

-Starr the game by sitting back and letting the opponents have their way.

-Concede a goal (often self inflicted)

-Throw caution to the win to try and turn the game around (usually after half time)

-Full time

It may have worked against Frankfurt, Marseille and Bourenmouth, but every time we've tried this dumb idea against any half decent team (Man United, Newcastle, Liverpool) it's backfired very badly because those teams know how to hold onto a lead.

A lot of players that aren't good enough for what we want to do, especially in our defense. We aren't going anywhere if we don't replace the likes of Dier, Davies, Sessegnon, Emerson, Doherty, Lucas and so on

It's wasn't a good game today for him, but there are other parts of the team that was more dire. Perisic really didn't look good today. Bringing in Richarlison instead of Son will not fix the defensive issues we have. And I think a lot of people don't realize Richie has no goals in the PL. 

Conte really needs to change his tactics when Man City responds literally instantly after halftime.",Worst part is I was behind the away section full of scum fans.

Lucky to get a draw

Second half FC again. 

I understand why we didn‚Äôt change much. We looked like scoring a third goal more than not and Sonny, though struggling was still getting looks. Also Dier had a terrible game and I hope he bounces back. 

This game hopefully demonstrated to the board why we need the exact transfers Conte is supposedly wanting. We‚Äôre better in a lot of ways but we need better centerbacks who can step in and play with less noticeable drop off in comfort and or ability. 

I think a lot of us are selling short how good Brentford have been. They picked up where they left off before the break and we are not the only team that benefits from time with their manager. I don‚Äôt doubt for a second sharpness and fitness were all over the spectrum for us. 

That all said as annoying as it is, a draw away to Brentford, with so many of our players returning f from a bloody fucking winter World Cup that should have never happened‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs not a terrible result.

We‚Äôve not been at the races all season! I hope this game is a wake up call for Conte and the team and we kick on from here!","I just fucking love Bentancur lads, gives me butterflies when I see him play. He‚Äôs been so consistently good it‚Äôs not even funny. He has had so many games now where he has been a 8 or 9, yet so struggle to think of games that he was legitimately bad. He has had a few average performances, but actually bad ones have been so rare for him. I can think of the United Away and one more that just slips my mind right now.","What a shit win.

GET IN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Bissouma was a great sub- changed everything when he came on

Son was on fire when subbed on

Secondhalf.fc","Should have tried 3-5-2. Whenever Son and Kane are free together up top, we seem to score and win. We don‚Äôt need Son defending and tracking back.

They were more dangerous and kept making sub ti stay fresh. While Conte did crap nothing beside watching. This loss is 50% on players & 50% on Conte.,"Shocking PEH didn't come off.

Shocking Conte didn't use more than one sub in general.

I'm no expert but the second Ogbonna comes on for Creswell you put Spence on, who's been warming up for 15 minutes, him and Richy against Ogbonna and Zouma on that left hand side make the last 15 minutes of the game unbearable for those two. Instead Conte puts both Spence and Sess back on the bench.

And last, but certainly not the least important point, I'm really afraid this is what teams will do to us now. Literally just give us the ball and watch us suffer. Perfect example was United in the last two gameweeks, perfect counter attacking football display against Liverpool, everyone praising the performance, and then you get to Southampton away where they're comfortable with letting you have the ball and you struggle. They scored one goal and the difference was they survived the day without a brainfart and conceding and we couldn't. But we need to improve our possession game asap.","Richarlison <3

Find a new project manager that will get style and substance back to Spurs and do not renew Contes contract. He‚Äôs so expensive, neglects youth and the football is complete dross.

Hugo didn‚Äôt look good today. I actually think he‚Äôs becoming a bigger issue than our back line, in fact his deficiencies put so much pressure on them. I hate typing that, he‚Äôs given us so much. But he is clearly not the GK he once was, at least, not lately.

* We should do more crosses. Our aerial presence in their box is immense and I'm bewildered as to why we're crossing only 78 times a game when we should easily be doing triple digits. At 1% chance of scoring this would net us 1 goal per game.
* I think we should remove one of our central midfielders in favor of another center back. 3 are obviously not enough, as seen in the way we concede goals. Too few players in our own box.
* I love to see our players giving it their all. I genuinely could not point to one single player in our squad who does not care, they are all pressing and breathing their lungs out. Love to see it. So much will in this squad.
* We should move less when attacking - tires us out and then we do not have energy to score. I think the players should try to stay stationary as much as possible, especially during the first 60 minutes.","Perisic...what's the point of him? Sanchez....waste of ‚Ç¨40m.

2. If Lucas had the game Sonny played today. He looked clueless, and as Lucas in most games, like a headless chicken, just going literally nowhere with it until he eventually gets surrounded by 2-3 players and just knocks into them. People would be saying he shouldn't see the pitch ever again. I'm not saying sell Sonny, but I'd honestly put Sess or Doherty lwb, and Perisic LW against Arsenal. Perisic just makes shit happen, it's just that he usually crosses it because he's on the flank.

Does anyone in here really have faith they can keep their form for the whole season? 

Despite *our* downfalls, we looked to keep a solid hold on third or at least fourth. I‚Äôve got multiple injuries that should be due back over the World Cup break or after the World Cup, And our fitness has clearly been a factor with all that coming from behind to win, never mind the mental fortitude that requires. Anyone doubting Conte needs to get their head screwed on straight. 

You combine our current position in the table with  all the adversity we faced in the first half this season, and the news stories about us looking to spend a decent amount of cash in January how the fuck can you not be at least content with our current position?!

There‚Äôs been a few games that I‚Äôve been Snoozefests. I won‚Äôt deny that, but it‚Äôs been a low-key new story for a good few seasons about just how many games we play and how big of squads teams need, and really only the top few teams I world are truly deep enough to avoid fatigue issues. I think we should be damn excited that our tired players have kept us in the top four despite struggles going into a break where we can spend a lot of money and first and second place or at least second place aren‚Äôt truly out of reach. 

And we managed to scrape into the round of 16 for the champions league which is not much of a success as much avoiding failure. yet we‚Äôre still there. We didn‚Äôt look much better when we made it to the final with Poch.

This team still has not put in a dominant performance 11 games into the season and tbf it wont happen, it's just who they are
3. This style of play is not sustainable when you give the opposition at least 15 shots. against top 6 teams, spurs wont get the ball and when they do, their passing is not clinical at all.

Sess was amazing. He‚Äôs playing with his right foot more, focused on his man and not the ball and he‚Äôs clearly learning from his mistakes and/or actively trying to work on it and you can see the payoffs. I think Sess will still reach his potential or get close. 

, contes subs and tactics were amazing. The crowd and fans are amazing. Midfield did their job. PEH is seriously so underrated by fans imo. Him now with Biss behind and Bentancur playing amazingly well just unlocks Pierre.

Players like dier, lloris etc are always good for giving away a goal every couple games. When you have a couple players like that, voila! You end up giving up a goal every game out of nothing. Contes style of keeping it tight will never work as long as we have players that constantly shit themselves. Our defence all have the tendency to shit themselves, and its just a domino effect. They don't trust each other and are constantly anticipating each other making a mistake. You can't play football scared all the time like that, it'll never work.

Way to many inconsistencies in the game. Idk how the push on Sess doesn‚Äôt get called and multiple other instances aren‚Äôt a card. A bit loss for words there.,"Bentancur. Period. 
That‚Äôs all folks","I often think we forget that we didn't finish last season amazingly. We fell apart in a few games at the end of last season and obviously in that run before beating city. 

The team has so many weaknesses and we went into this season without addressing that LCB CB and RWB are such huge vulnerabilitys in our system.

We brought in Perisic to cover for Sess being meh but he's obviously very questionable beyond dead balls and crossing. I also thought we could be in with a chance for the title this year but in retrospect that was insanely wishful thinking.

I'm convinced we don't work on our midfield or final third at all in training.",,Bryan Gil saw how Lucas Moura played and thought 'what if it was even more unhinged?',"Anthony Taylor absolutely ruined this game. It was a stupid challenge by Emerson but that did not deserve a red card by any means. Arsenal were good but an outside of the box shot and a Hugo blunder was all they could muster before we went down to 10 men. 

We have to play more on the front foot in the future and have more control in the midfield but as for this match, throw this one in the bin and move on to the next one","Happy to see Spence get even a single minute. Maybe next time it‚Äôs a bit longer. The way we‚Äôve seen Gil just maybe creep into Conte‚Äôs circle of trust. 

It‚Äôs interesting to see, some players get thrown in right away, and some seem to take a long time to adapt. Seeing how Conte was right about Gil (too easily muscled off the ball) and Bissouma (still needing to learn defensive responsibilities) and also the players he‚Äôs turned to quickly, Deki, Bentancur, Richarlison‚Ä¶maybe he actually does want to protect the players from bad performances and does in fact know what he‚Äôs doing on this front.

Conte is a weird mix of patient and motivated. Usually highly motivated people also come across as a bit reckless and very patient people come across as passive.

Edit: typo",Harry very emotional in the post-match interview ‚ù§Ô∏è,"‚ÄúSon strikes me as the kind of guy who gets benched and takes it very personally but has the best response. He doesn‚Äôt put his nose to the grindstone but puts his entire face through the grindstone.

I think we also would have benefited from starting our leaner more progressive players. I feel like Skipp, Gil, Matt, and Kulu could have strung far better passes together. The problem is their defense out tho, which is probably Conte‚Äôs major issue.","Sadly I don't think we've been convincing all season. All our points, bar Southampton, have been scrappy and with some luck on our side. All I can hope for is Son to liven up a bit and the team to start playing as a unit as the season goes on.

It‚Äôs really sad","I feel like everyone wants to blame the defenders, but this was a game where we got overrun in midfield and the defenders were often left backpedaling on an island. 

Bentancur is huge for us. And obviously Deki as an outlet for the midfield passing. Idk what has happened to Sonny, but he isn't getting himself open, not creating separation and providing an outlet. 

Bissouma has been such a disappointment. I thought he was more of a dribbler and a creator. Someone who sneaks out of sticky situations. Idk if that's Conte's tactics, but he seems to barely get on the ball. Invisible.

3. Kulusevski & Bentancur were superb 10/10. They won these 3 pts 
4. Kane did well despite his fatigue. He was everywhere. 
5. Dier is poor again as RCB, he doesn‚Äôt have pace. Played better in his natural spot.

7. Llioris was poor. He could‚Äôve saved all 3 goals (1st went on his near post under his arm, 2nd was shot straight at him, 3rd his positioning was very wrong too close to post).

Bissouma's first start wasn't great.  I believe he'll improve, but he's got a long ways to go if he want to compete with Bentancur.

Chelsea made us look best in the league. Maybe we are when things click like this","TLDR: really hate the fans who turn on our players at the drop of a hat especially ones like Son who‚Äôs been incredible and loyal to us but saw people wanting to get rid of him. Emerson.. who has done nothing but try to be better for us, etc. 

Emerson definitely benefits from competition but he‚Äôs had bad games during these rumors and good. I think now it‚Äôs mainly about his confidence rising, he knows his positioning and his defensive awareness is seriously much better than any wingback we have. Porro, Spence both have these big lapses in defense.

Also kudos to coaching staff for making him cut in more and kudos to Emerson for his mindset. 23 y.o and a Spurs player yet people want to give up on young players asap it‚Äôs so odd. Especially someone who‚Äôs so happy to be here and wants to improve, I really hope he keeps going and I think his natural confidence will help with that and I hope some Spurs fans can be less toxic about our players and just wish them the best while they‚Äôre playing for us especially if they‚Äôre known to not be an Ndombele in work ethic. 

Playing out of position and crucified by media, fans, and rival fans yet he always has this feeling that he just really appreciates playing football. Same for Doherty who was terrible at RB,m and then once he plays his natural position, he turns into Irish Cafu. So I never will give up on our players unless they gave up on us. 

People shittin on Perisic and Sonny without considering they are playing in a system where Son‚Äôs best space is taken away just to do Cross Inshallah and having a 35 yo Perisic playing mostly every match + taking on defenders is just not using them to the best abilities in their current stages of their careers. Perisic going in the box for Croatia was key for them winning games and we can utilize his height much more there. I think he should be our back up wing to Son or Lucas so he doesn‚Äôt have to track back so much (Perisic). They‚Äôve both won us games this season even with them being limited by the system.. I hate fans who just switch up every second/game. 

Saw a lot of toxicity on Conte at every turn - yeah he has his criticisms but people were on his dick just last season lol. People giving up while we‚Äôre still top 5 and acting like we‚Äôre west ham in relegation territory or Chelsea who look like shit even with an ‚Äúattacking‚Äù coach compared to Conte. 

I‚Äôve seen people turn on Cuti recently as well (not fair criticisms but saying the worst takes). same with Lloris who‚Äôs a club legend.. and you never know how much you miss them until they‚Äôre gone.. haha.  

PEH-Skipp was not what I expected to see but wow they played great. PEH playing that through ball and his passing in general is so underrated.. can‚Äôt believe people will still think he‚Äôs only a tackler that sideways/back passes. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs one of our most progressive passers. Skipp‚Äôs timing in his tackle is so fuckkng smooth it‚Äôs satisfying. 

Son looking like his confidence is back just looking at his touches, his drives, shot, etc. baby steps but it was good to give Richy his start he deserves and for Son to get rest. Looked like he was fresh and was perfect against tired legs. Who knew that playing Kulu and son without their back to goal 90% of the game would be better (although Kulu is great at that, he‚Äôs wasted if all three of our forwards are doing this I.e last game I believe this in our loss).

Son without Perisic gave Son his space back entirely. And scored within minutes.. I believe Drury or the commentators in general said he was on for 5 minutes, 7 touches, 2 chances created and a goal.","Conte has to go man. I can‚Äôt stand this football anymore.

Bentancur shows the character that we have lost long time ago. Im happy to see him growing better.  Pair him with Deki, their chemistry is intact. Doherty also working great with Deki. Emerson? Just ship him out next window. Just wasting attacking chances. Im tired enough of him.

He's completely incapable of adapting his tactics and for half a season has just tried to brute-force a tactic that the squad is clearly not cut out for. He talks about how we need 2-3 years to build the squad up to a title-challenging standard but then completely refuses to play the prospects that we have that could develop to be key parts of that squad.

He's shown no adaptability, he's been openly disloyal to the club (he talks about leaving after almost every loss like we should be on our knees begging him to stay), he has no interest in planning for the future despite this squad clearly being at least two seasons off his goal of challenging for the title.

It‚Äôs like we turn into prime Real Madrid in the second halves.,ben10 is fucking special,"Can really see why Conte has said it'll take several windows to get this club where we need them. 

Several areas on the pitch that need upgrades/players to learn to be better with time. 

Need an upgrade to both wingbacks - Royal isn't good enough and continues to show why Barcelona was all too happy to be rid of him, and despite Doherty being better than Royal, he isn't really the game changer we need either. Fuck Matty Cash and all that, but we need upgrading there. Similar situation on the other side too. Sess is quick and makes ok runs, but he can't put an accurate cross into the box to save his life and chances on that left hand side die with him a lot. 

Need upgrades to Sanchez, Lenglet, and Davies - Sanchez is athletic and that's fine, but there's a reason teams turn the press up as soon as he's on the ball. They don't even have to turn it up to 10 for it to make a difference either. Turn the press up from a 5 to a 7 and you're going to get a turnover out of Sanchez. The same goes for Davies, who's distribution isn't great, who's crosses are as wayward as Sess and Royal's, and who doesn't have to quickness to be a starter. Davies has been a great serviceman to the club, and is always great for a block or two in a game, but we need an upgrade there. Lenglet's distribution is better than both of those two, and he's at least as good a defender as Davies, but he might not be here long-term. 

Lloris' successor needs to be sorted, and quickly. 

We need someone who can slot into the midfield who isn't a defensive midfielder and has creative ideas and skills. Skipp, Hojbjerg, Bentancur, and Bissouma are all good, but they're all defensively-minded first, and their instincts are to protect the ball first, not to go and be attacking with it. This is part of why we see so many sideways and backward passes, even when we're near the opponent's 18-yard box.

By my count that means we need 4 defenders, a keeper, and at least one midfielder before we can be considered anything more than a top-four team.","Shouldn‚Äôt have come to the VAR.

There were at least three critical tackles that looked like he was just waiting for the attacker to put the ball where he wanted to take it from them and then just walked away. Twice he passed it directly to Lloris, once a fucking header, both times while the box had opponents present and neither time did I stroke out on fear. Both of those passes to Lloris looked as if they‚Äôd had a conversation about it moments before, so casual it was nuts! And his crosses are so fucking perfect.

They had to put more than half their squad at risk of ejection to keep us at bay. Any or all of those six yellow cards could have been the clean, orchestrated and dominating attack we‚Äôve been asking for, and Forest were so scared of it they stopped it anyway they could. 

And this has me wondering if tactical fouls aren‚Äôt a big part of Son‚Äôs frustration. All four games have seen at least one or two prime chances for Son to break into a 1v1 against the keeper but he gets dragged to the pitch by the last man. I get it‚Äôs part of the game to play like that, and I‚Äôve certainly cheered Sess and Cuti for fouling strikers as a last resort. I bet it‚Äôs got to get into your head when so many chances are just straight robbed from your feet.","for the people calling for sonny's head, just remember kane had a rough start last season and picked things up. give sonny some time, he'll get there",West Ham post match thread is an indulgence today.

Pain","So proud of our boys.

Not easy to beat a 12 man Chelsea team.",Stellini 100% success rate‚Ä¶ üëÄ,"Conte lacks passion, tactics, adaptability, everything. It sickens me when people literally sing his name every match. What are you watching?",Baffled by how City only had one yellow,"I just can't understand how anyone can watch this and think it's ""Contes tactics"" it's fucking obvious we often go out guns blazing and then either Dier or most often Lloris does a horrendous action and we shrink. It's not a ""2 vs 3"", it's a trust thing. Our wingbacks don't trust our centrebacks and our centrebacks don't trust our goalkeepers, that makes our midfielders shrink back. Arsenal literally uses 3 players to do this. Why? They trust Gabriel and Saliba and Partey to deal with it. Everyone else is free to just to press, attack get into position collect balls.

Once Hugo/Dier does his weekly fuck up (in this game he fucked up three times in one half yay) We shrink, we play balls backwards, we certainly do not trust anyone else so currently we are playing with 7 players where there should be 3 and people wonder why we struggle to build/win balls?

Just like it was at Liverpool, Just like it was at Man City, Just like it was at Milan what did they do? They got a top tier keeper and a top tier centreback and suddenly their midfield could play football again isn't that weird?

It's not a Conte tactics problem, it's not even a midfield problem. It's actually a Tottenham problem. We hold on to players for way to long. Lloris has not been good enough for such a long time, but he's a club legend so he has to play. We did the same with Eriksen, we did the same with Dembel√© when his hip was clearly ruined for ever long before he stopped playing for us.

How many seasons do we need to ruin to be nice? You play if you're good enough not because you've been here for a long time.

You can even see it in our results and the whole second half FC thing. The reason is we shrink from the stupid repeat misstakes in the first half we go out Conte tells them ""You can not be doing this shit you have to step up"". We come out we step up if we score a goal we keep doing it if we don't the fear comes creeping back in and we shrink again. You point it out time and time again and somehow people want to blame Conte for it. Conte is good, his tactics is good, they win shit and you can absolutely see it in how we were playing last season. This is a player problem and can only be solved by getting rid of the accident prone liabilites we have at the back. There isn't a manager in this world that can deal with Hugo, Davinson and Dier. We've had three top managers in Poch, Mourinho and Conte all of them have been let down by players at the back being insanely soft. This blind loyalty is the real problem, keep blaming the managers, the pitch, the refs and keep these players around and they'll do the same thing for the next manager. 

Just take this game, now I don't even rate Ramsdale I think he is a mid tier at best goalkeeper but if they had Lloris and we had Ramsdale we would have gone into this half 2-0 up, Ramsdale made two quality saves and Lloris fumbled in two goals.

If they had Lloris, we had Ramsdale who btw is an ok keeper at best, we win this 3-1 minimum. We are so conditioned to dealing with conceding these piss goals that people start looking for any other excuse other than the obvious one. 

It is January and Hugo Lloris has cost his team more points than any other goalkeeper has... over an entire season. 

Errors leading to goals: 5 , Errors leading to goals for all other prem goalkeepers combined: 6. He is done he has to go in January.","Why don‚Äôt you just sell Kane and Son while they still have value, and start all over again",The Harry Kane team,Yeah I came or whatever,Feels nice to go to bed happy,Why we don‚Äôt always play like the second half?,Sessegnon is a League One player.,2ND HALF FC,Bet on Leeds to be up at half time.

Just saying","For the first time in a while, I thought we were really applying the press well and forcing turnovers by Fulham. We were much more solid in midfield and passing was quite a bit better. I was frustrated by the number of times we back-passed or checked back as it destroys our attacking momentum. We still really need the mids to move into open spaces/triangles so that we don't have to recirculate the ball from the back. I guess it's easier w/ 3 in the middle but I did like the effort from attackers dropping deeper when needed to progress the attack. I hope we do well in CL this week."

This is the way going forward","Yikes, that was a dreadful match from everyone involved; albeit with varying degrees of awful. 

* I honestly felt bad for Forster when he had to play behind a backline with 0 natural CB's. Davies was the best CB of the day and that tells you everything you need to know.
* The wingbacks... Lord have mercy, they were poor today. Perisic wouldn't pass the ball to Sonny at all again AND he got cooked on that first goal from LC. Porro was absolutely awful defensively but offered a bit more moving forward and linked up play with Kulusevski well.
* The midfield just crumbled when Bentancur went down. I really hope he gets healthy soon because Hojbjerg just isn't enough on his own. 
* Sonny had another poor game. He should have passed the ball to Kane on the break. It's woefully apparent that he's being played out of his position and away from his strengths. 
* Kane had a poor match as well. He had poor service and was constantly marked when he did. 
* Kulusevski's touches were awful as well. 0 danger and creativity. His dribbles were slow and predictable. 

Nobody really covered themselves in glory today; leading to the 4-1 scoreline. The defense was National League defending at best today but the forwards should have done more.","can't believe Emerson Leite de fucking Souza Junior had a good performance for actually spineless players to bottle it.

Aside from that, a lot of it is just simply shaking up the selection a bit which Conte is so baffingly unwilling to do. I can understand that he's never going to change his tactics, but the team selections and sub decisions I really can't. Take Perisic out of the team for once, put Son on the bench until the second half...these are things we should've been doing often since the start of the season.","We probably beat City as Conte was away.

Either A Levy and the board will have seen what we all saw today, and in recent games, and take the decision which will impact the remaining season by spending considerably on the players Conte wants, and we could be in with a slim chance of top 4. Bearing in mind however Levy doesn‚Äôt think long-term (excluding the stadium and what that offers), whether it‚Äôs buying or selling players. Rather than selling unwanted players for the prices that they‚Äôre worth (and not what Levy coins) as we have seen in the past, he holds onto them, hoping they‚Äôll pick up form and better their financial value, albeit by sending them on loan or keeping in the squad. 

Which leads onto B. That Levy and the board will remain ostriches with their heads stuck in the sand, oblivious to the workings and advances of our rivalling teams, and predictably will sign dross, plan B‚Äôers, if that. Conte will either remain sulkily or leave gleefully, and this time I think the fans will finally all turn on the owners in mostly unison.

1. The pass is backwards, not towards Kane. So in this scenario, the pass is NOT directed at an offside player.
2. The Sporting player redirects the pass towards a Tottenham player who is in (potentially) an offside position. How is this deemed offside?
3. They have the moment of contact wrong
4. VAR is for clear and obvious decisions. This is literally anything but that. If it takes 4 minutes to come to a conclusion that isn't clear or obvious, then the on field decision should be standing.

TLDR: what the fuck","Shocking performance from everyone bar Hugo. Awful passing, awful first touches. So many dreadful performances, so many instances of terrible defending.

We lost control of that game for long periods and were second-best all over the pitch for a time to a side with zero confidence and paper-thin team spirit. Our midfield becomes holographic with alarming frequency, and as I said in the match thread, they spend most of their time too far away to support the press and not close enough to effectively protect the back 3. 


It's hard to say if the switch to 3-5-2 was what did it, or if that simply dovetailed with Leicester downing tools, but 3 in midfield will probably be the way to go against the better teams, who will have  the ability to hurt us much more than a pretty pathetic Leicester side.

A, not totally uncommon mistake from Lloris was massive... but he's won us more points than he's cost us, so I wouldn't give him a hard time over it. 

Bentancur was sensational. 

The game plan was as expected, and was working. Soak up pressure knowing arsenal would come out strong, then grow into the game. You can't just turn up and look to dominate.... It was a freak goal that the rapist would miss 99 times out of 100. Then a GKing error.

- pick the starting line up

- pick the bench

- make substitutes

- change the formation

- change the tactic

- give instructions throughout the game

- energise the squad at half time

- let the players know they're being shit

Don't think he did any of these well at all. Really think he's at fault for this more than the players. That being said, so many were shit and deserve to be dropped. We have more options and we need to use them.","When will we learn that we cannot play half assed against West Ham? Or any team in the league for that matter.

Sadly I've not felt we've been a team worthy of being 3+ up in quite a while.

This has just made a bad football week worse. Fingers crossed for Wednesday and that Kulu, Richi and PEH recover very soon. That said, I did feel like there was a lot of commitment from Lucas when he came on. Just doesn't feel like there's enough of it throughout the 90 and the first XI.

I‚Äôm too sick to type a lengthy comment but Son is slowly getting better. But as I wrote this, he fucking scores!!!

Was going to say touch and passing have been getting better but his confidence is going up and it showed in that run he made in the midfield. He wouldn‚Äôt do that normally in recent days and I miss that. But I‚Äôve heard people call to replace Son so quickly like‚Ä¶ he was our golden boot winner last season for fucks sake. If it happens again next year that he‚Äôs doing insanely poor, then we can have an argument. But it‚Äôs the same with Doherty haters or Dier, etc. Same with Lloris with fantastic saves today. Conte said it.. if you stop trusting these 3, you‚Äôre gonna have problems. Glad he didn‚Äôt stop trusting any of the 3 since they were all crucial to our win and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt listen to Reddit managers. 

Gotta say my fav is and reason I was more excited for this game is to see Pape Sarr due to the circumstances. He was amazing to watch in the WC and before so I‚Äôm hyped for him. Think he‚Äôs more creative and offensive than we‚Äôre led to believe. Watching him get let down at Metz last season was not fun but showed how good he is. His teammates were so bad there yet he still shined

This game shows how silky smooth Sarr is and how good defensively he is. I wanted him on over Skipp vs this Palace team because of their players but that‚Äôs not meant to be a sleight on Skipp. 

Gil is getting stronger it looks like and/or understanding the physical requirements of the league I.e you can‚Äôt go down and expect to get calls. He hasn‚Äôt been doing that. Put in a great defensive shift.

Cuti I love you. Dier was solid. Lenglet is a must buy if cheap. 

And whoever thinks Perisic is bad for our club needs to get a medical check or something lol. I‚Äôve heard so much Perisic slander recently it‚Äôs crazy.  I swear he has the most assists for us and won us games with his set pieces.

Does Antony ping shots beyond the box every game for them? That's all he literally did and it looks like his only job, which I‚Äôm glad United got robbed in daylight paying for his overpriced 4 feet ass.

What the fuck happened to playing attractive football, then we bring in Jose, Nuno, and Conte.",Atwell abyssmal,Ogbonna draws his eyebrows on js,Why must you keep ruining my Saturdays! üò©,"Can I play devil's advocate and say that in the last ten games if Hugo hadn't been back on the sauce things wouldn't be as bad?

Guys like a tissue umbrella at the moment",We don't deserve good things,if kulusevski isnt on the field this team is simply not worth watching.,SCUBA SUITS!!!,Did anyone else hear the elation from the crowd at sess's substitution?,"Actually we took everything we wanted from this game maybe exception of seeing Spence game time. 4-0 Win, Son goal, Clean sheet, great display by Gil and Sarr, Skipp struggled a bit but mostly solid and active. But man‚Ä¶ Emerson bro","People knew bissouma was balling out under progressive managers who play possession football, but LOSE THEIR FUCKING MINDS when he does badly under a defensive manager 

Tanguy 2.0. We are going to ruin Bissouma's confidence too",Are we seeing the last of Son in Tottenham soon?,I like the antispurs. Bottling up front is a revolutionary new tactic.,Heart attack FC,Tottenham until they kill us,,Tough MOTM call between Salah and Madley,Never in doubt,Gotta buy multiple high quality players in January or top 4 is gone.,"Seriously, fuck VAR. üò≠

We were in the stadium rejoicing, and VAR robbed us of our happiness.",Just embarrassing,,"When we needed them most, our stars come out and fucking show up! Swear, Gian‚Äôs passing is terrible but I think it‚Äôs motivating all the players to play hard and win for him. It showed during our Brighton game and this.

Also, PEH haters can suck a fat nut. I remember reading people saying he‚Äôs not good enough for top clubs and we need to improve him. He‚Äôs getting better and better while playing great defense. Can‚Äôt believe I have to actually argue with people about this. Watching him in Denmark and our games, it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs absolutely integral to our teams‚Äô success. Same as Lloris.. like it‚Äôs mind blowing seeing some people not consider him world class. He made some blunders but so does every top keeper yet he‚Äôs still world class for us and has saved us more points than lost. 

Shakey as fuck once we subbed people off and Bryan made up for his mistake, fantastic ball control. He just needs to learn to try and stay up rather than fall after every contact. I‚Äôm confident Conte will instill that in him if he keeps playing. 

Can‚Äôt be shutting off like that. Was not nervous at all.. üòÖ. Kane rocketing that penalty was shocking but he‚Äôs human and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs going to obsess over that lol

Team showed up but damn, I‚Äôm so glad we had someone like Gian at the club. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs inspiring all our players especially the ones he was very close to like Sonny. He definitely made Gian proud with these two goals.. i just imagine him hugging Sonny and our players after the game. Damn. Rest In Peace and our respects to Gian were definitely noticed by Conte who I think may consider staying here a bit longer seeing these type of actions and our support.

COYS","Not the end of the world, but REALLY hoping Conte becomes more flexible with the formations.","Good win overall, tactics fine today. We are beating the teams we should beat, which is good, now need a statement win away to Man Utd on Wednesday. (and then against Eddie Howe's on fire Newcastle at home next weekend)","Not the best of watches (no surprise given what the players been going through the past couple of days), but at least we got the three points.

Defence was good besides some stray passes, Midfield was good overall (Bissouma settled in after the yellow card), the attack is meh.....what use to be our biggest strength has turned to a weak point, so far this season.","First ever Tottenham match in from the US and that was absolutely incredible. Up on the Park Lane corner and the experience was unmatched.

Really glad we decided to wake up and kick LC in the dick for the whole second half of play because LC pittering around with the ball to create no opportunities got real old real fast.","Conte Out, Nuno In!",Fuck those chelsea wankers,just kidnap Pedro Porro on the way back,Makes it worse that Arsenal keep winning,"emerson was very good this game. great defensively and made great runs with good positioning in transition and attack. his ball skills, crossing, and end product are mediocre to but you can see why Conte rates him. love richy already, having another aerial threat along with kane in the box is huge",That cross from Richy!! Outside of the boot,Those 3 points are going to end up being super important I think.  That is match we would have drawn 0-0 (or even lost 1-0) most seasons.,Does richarlison‚Äôs card disappear because of disallowed goal?
83,papa poch time,Why the hell do we just try and cross all game when do we even score from crosses besides corners. It plays into a team with a solid defence of lumps hands. Such a stupid strategy. Well done Sheffield absolutely played in a way that nullified these dinosaur tactics.,"Lmao you love to see it

They've spent millions on players and manager on long contract, and you see them out there not even cooperating with themselves or having any sort of chemistry",[deleted],"What is the point of playing a system that invites pressure on the defence, when we have 1(one) good defender at the club?

Pathetic dross performance again.",Lloris fell off the planet.,Who was that little tramp who ran on the pitch?,Bring Poch home,nice game for Royal.  Lloris still scares the shit out of me.,Second-half FC this season for sure,"Absolutely chuffed to bits for the team, boy oh boy did they and we need that!",Not amused. We did well for 25 minutes but if we actually played football for more than a 3d of a match we'd win this. Fix this shit Conte.,I just don‚Äôt see any quality in Spence. Emerson looks better than Spence.,"This team shortens my life span every time they play, but I will support them til the day I die watching them",In Canada we‚Äôd call that a fuckin‚Äô barn burner.,Hey! We got to see Spence and Gil and no one was injured! Woo!,,"As a Liverpool fan, just want to say great game. You played well, and had a better 2nd half than we had a 1st. Very strong team, even though Son and Richarlison among others are missing. Definitely contenders for top 4. These games happen, doesn‚Äôt take away from how good the current Spurs squad is. Good luck going forward.",Give Gianni Vio a raise,Always gonna hit a rough patch or two (or more cos it‚Äôs spurs) in the season heads up,"Anyone who says that VAR made the correct call is a fucking dope lol.

VAR was looking for a reason to rule that goal out.","In this day and age you need ball-playing defenders and both Davies and Dier should've been upgraded long ago. Without the solidity and quality passing from out the back, the rest of the team suffers by having to play closer and help out.

United have bought so many players though, Varane, Casemiro, Eriksen, Bruno, etc are all a class of player Spurs haven't been able to attract.",,Fucking hell can we do stuff easy way for once?,"braindead challenge by Emerson. can‚Äôt be doing that at the opponents home pitch, you should know they‚Äôll get favorable calls. shambles","i love matt doherty 

so happy to see him play",[deleted],"Seeing the reactions as Son scored and he was less smiley but relieved? That first goal, that big embrace .. talk about emotional. ü•≤","I am with Son to the death, but my god he has started this season so not-sharp","IMPROVEMENT. Also, battle of bridge manager version. ANTONIO CONTE MY FUCKING MANAGER","We didn‚Äôt play that bad and we deserved at least a draw, but when the margins are too narrow you always run the risk of variance having the result go the other way. But it‚Äôs still our fault leaving ourselves at the mercy of variance against an inferior opponent.",petition for perisic to be set piece taker indefinitely:,"Things I noticed in the Game - 

1. I don't really like to say something bad about the referees considering the abuse that they normally get, but damn the referee was awful. It was like he was born yesterday and has no idea that players can fake a foul. I am surprised he even gave the red card. 
2. We were nowhere as good as we can be.
3. Marseille man marked our entire front three, basically taking them out of the game in the first half, not letting them drop to create space.
4.  Emerson was the Spurs player in the first half, which was both a good and a bad sign.
5. Kane and Son had a really bad game, and yet we won. I don't remember the last time that happened.
6. Richy and Deki stepped up when it was needed, a clear indication that we are heading in the right direction. Richy specially is slowly becoming the love of my life.
7. In the end as the Vedas said, ""A win is a win is a win"".
8. COYS","Honestly, I want to see Richarlison Bissouma Spence for starter for cup games. maybe 352?","Tough tough game..

Very good result.

Wolves need a target Man",Best performance of the season without the guy who has been maybe our best player this season.
84,"Conte is getting ¬£15m a year for being a ""world class"" manager and serial winner yet gets out thought by wolves. Wolves made the changes and took control. Conte just let it happen. There is no project, there is no plan B. There is only excuses and fishing for an Italian gig. Put him and us out of our misery and get him out.","Peresic with a million pointless crosses, sanchez who's a walking liability and a starting lineup which showed we never took this game seriously in the first place, fuck it",Poor ref. He‚Äôs gonna have to work really hard recover the money he lost on this match.,"Perisic can‚Äôt start anymore pure and simple

Conte is a massive drag on this squad by the looks of it

Davies LWB is the way","Spurs and losing to relegation sides after beating City away, name a better duo.","conte leaves, kane goes too. Start fresh and see what we can do. Honestly, this season has been so grim at times","We're either a couple of pieces away and Conte is the man to manage that squad, or we're in need of a painful rebuild and he isn't.

We're trying to pretend it's the former when it's actually the latter.

I don't know how we attract top talent to this project when the manager won't even commit to it.",One of our worst games this season. The only consolation is that Liverpool and Chelsea are still below us in the table. But they are hitting their strides...and top 3 are moving away fast...we need to improve or risk dropping further down.,Best game I‚Äôve ever seen from Royal,Very well said. Couldn't have hoped for much more today.,Sarr looks *much* better than both Hojbjerg and Skipp.,Why do we start every game like a relegation team,Thank god for Kane's golazo. Still can't believe how poor Spurs are at finishing chances in front of the net. Glad for the win.,CARDIAC COCKS STRIKE AGAIN,Bruh,Spurs the first side to play two 1st halves in one match,,That post about scoring stoppage time winners in the 95th minute being sustainable is looking really good right now,Our fans were in great voice. Heard them loud and clear on the telly,"Only got to watch highlights, but Skipp seemed to play decently. Anyone who watched the game have an opinion on him today?",We didn't lose 3 games in a week! Qualifying still in our hands. What a fucking shit show at the end thought we had done it,Poor but we move on.,,"Fuck it, we'll take it",Doherty has a little beard now.,"Doherty so much better than Emerson. 

üëÄ

Hopefully Doherty will start every game from here on out. 

üôè","thought sess was really good today, played with a lot of confidence which is something i‚Äôve felt has been holding him back","How a player can come out of the bench and just change the game.. after being in a goal drought.

Scores two WORLD CLASS goals like fucking what?! And a hattrick?! He changed the game and it‚Äôs absolutely insane the depth we have.

Hugo, always a wall for us and has been our savior in many times. 

Bentancur was absolutely fucking amazing this game. Broke up crucial moments where it could have led to a goal and was so calm. Completely different from Sporting. The whole team had such great energy but big props to Bentancur. 

Same with Hojberg. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING game. He was breaking out dribbles and great passes I‚Äôve never seen from him before. Progressive passing, calm and works so well with Biss and Bentancur too. Imagine Skipp and the depth we have there..

You can tell the difference with this spurs team,  they care about each other like family. Integrated like family and that makes such a great team environment. Everyone was so happy for Son. As usual. Seeing Biss go up to him repeatedly to compliment him like family even though he just joined us.. is awesome. I love that they genuinely seem to enjoy each others‚Äô success and that‚Äôs gonna take us far

Also cant believe I forgot to shout out Kane. He was so much better when we had an outlet in Son to go long. He retains the ball and I don‚Äôt even know how.. the dribble on the left wing that led to the Bentancur shot.. crazy. And people say he‚Äôs slow

Sess and Dave had poor games and clearly caused us a goal each imo. But just means they had a bad game and the fact that the team can come back from giving up two preventable goals  and just go on to demolish.. wow. Romero is sorely needed though. 

Emerson did very well in his minutes, crucial in defense for us. 

Great subs and tactics by Conte, have to give him credit since I saw a lot of complaints about it since he‚Äôs been hired (some cases understandably). But amazing way he handled this, changing formations and tactics since we were getting closed down every time with three players just asking it to their feet. Introducing Son, frees up all that and obviously more lol. 

COYS GODDAMN",Ben Davies coming back may as well save Conte...Perisic is not the answer to anything...he interferes with offensive play and is a below average defender...keep Sess and Davies together like last season.,What a cunt Tuchel is,"No real sign of Bissouma, Skipp, Spence, Doherty or Gil at all this season. Are they even in the plans? You‚Äôd hope so considering we‚Äôve just signed 2 of them

What‚Äôs the point of having these players if they won‚Äôt even be used when the starters are clearly tired and playing like shit?",Sanchez being unable to pass when under pressure is going to continue to kill us. Our attack was completely stopped when they started pressing the backline,Dejan coming off the bench really changed the look going forward. He really is a multi-tool on the field,Is there a clip of son seeming annoyed and pissed or are people just saying that. Cheers,"Perisic is going to be our signing of the summer, potentially the league",How did lenglet do?
85,Conte/Stellini out.,This is what happens when you start shit players. Beat them in the first 60mins then make switches ffs,"Good god, I‚Äôm so glad we not only came away with a win but with no injuries.  Chelsea scum looked like they were looking to murder someone on the pitch.","Lenglet and Perisic bad, everyone else good","Absolute humiliation.  What were these tactics?   How are we not defensively sound under Conte?  Rodgers has these games where he out-tactics opponents for sure.  But Spurs were carved open again and again.

Defenders and/or midfielders pushing awfully high there in the first half with your backup keeper in.  And Forster certainly didn't have the necessary reflexes today.  Tanganga of all people was almost as far forward as Romero would get in the first half!!!! Could that be in the plan?   If so, what are the coaches thinking?!?!?
 
Would be nice for Son to connect with a pass now and then in the final third -- especially on the counter.  Even aside from the goalscoring, not a good year from him yet.","it's ok lads apparently we have the best home ground in the prem

/s","I‚Äôm a bit more conflicted than I expected to be. The first half was absolute garbage but we still only conceded a few decent opportunities. One goal was a ridiculous error and the other was a great shot from far out. Aside from that they didn‚Äôt have much. Then in the second half we had a lot of good shots but none quite good enough. Ramsdale made some big saves and that was that. 

It felt like a shit game but if lloris doesn‚Äôt make that mistake and ramsdale doesn‚Äôt make one of the couple great saves he had then the game goes differently. 

I just wish we‚Äôd stop gifting our opponents goals. Feels like we‚Äôve dropped so many points because we hand our opponents an early goal and then can‚Äôt break down the low block. Arsenal had zero incentive to attack in the second half because we handed them an easy 2 goal lead.","Fuck it, join the evil empires. Sell the club to some dystopian mega billionaire group. 

It would just be nice to see the club win something

Edit: /s removed",Amazing what spurs can do when they‚Äôre determinative and not sitting back constantly.,Woulda took 3-1 with son scoring rather than a clean sheet and him not,I‚Äôm glad to see Harvey White finally get minutes in an official game.,"I thought the change of pace with the world cup would make son snap out of it, but i guess not

he can't keep starting when he's playing like this","Conte, why Skipp? Why? WHY? ü§¨",Let‚Äôs set up a 45 min friendly before the next game so they think the first half is the second half,Dier has had a real howler of a month or so. Need him to get back on track and find some confidence at the WC.,Looked like a lot of players trying not to get injured before the WC,,Kulu changed the game but imagine if we had Sonny back,Both Sess and Perisic need to start.,Fucking Levy. Warchest or not. This is still the late hangover of a team that should have been replenished years ago and has bought some absolute dross that we're still dealing with.,FUCKING ROBBED.,"sobering result. we are not playing well enough for top 4 atm, not a chance",,"Bryan just makes shit happen

should‚Äôve been in on gold but takes a bad touch‚Ä¶ immediately presses, wins the ball, beats 2 defenders and wins a penalty. 

really liked what i saw from him. shocking last 10 minutes from Kane as well lol",All I wanted was one point.,"Good god that pass from Bentancur for the second goal .. great vision, great execution",The American commentators kept being surprised that PEH was literally everywhere. At one point we were on a break and instead of talking about it they kept talking about him. Class.,Welcome home Son,I should‚Äôve just worked,Tuchel the biggest bitch,"Conte truly cannot play in the champions league huh. It's obviously a random spectator's opinion vs a world class coach's, but sometimes the necessary action looks wayyyy too obvious to not take, and game after game, conte just doesn't take it. Why did it take 75 mins for kulusevski to come in, Wtf was emerson still doing on the field after all those misses. Hopefully this is a wake up call to the players rather than the fans. How this team transforms from one of the most entertaining to one of the hardest watches, I really don't understand.","A draw is appropriate for both teams.

Richarlison changed the game.

Conte should've used more subs.","I have a terrible idea: 4-2-3-1 with Kane supported by Son-Deki-Richarlison. 

Discuss.","What I liked today was Kane dropping into the right side 10 role more and letting Son play more in the middle at times in the first half. Getting Kane deeper and Son in a 1-on-1 in the middle of the pitch is dangerous against a team that plays 3 at the back. 

Didn't yield anything today but it will","That was a bit tough on the heart.   


We were so much better in the second half, but I'm not sure what it was that made the difference.",He is the reason
86,When Conte said we need suffer I didn‚Äôt know this is what he meant,"I was told that the entire point of consistent top 4 finishes was to build upon it by attracting top level players with the draw of UCL and eventually winning trophies. How many seasons now in a row have we secured top 4 with absolutely nothing to show for it? We‚Äôre about to have to rebuild with Son and Kane reaching their 30s soon and Lloris seemingly on his way out and have won 0 trophies. What is it about Spurs that decorated, proven managers come and shit the bed?",It was not just a lucky win. We completely outplayed them. Well deserved three points,Perisic is a terrible defender,I can‚Äôt believe we didn‚Äôt go for a CB in January. Leicester picked up Souttar for 15m who is better than our whole starting back line today.,"A loss is a loss but this one hurts so bad

Would have rather lost 4-0 then give up that lead in the second half just brutal","Just about everything that can go wrong for us today happened. Lloris's mistakes, we lost basically every 50/50 decision, Ramsdale suddenly deciding to be a savant etc.

I see in the second half what Conte is trying to do. Arsenal were ran ragged. But the fact remains we failed to score and lost. I've defended our defense before especially players like Dier, but to execute Conte's tactics, I see now that our defense can't be just ok or even good occasionally, it has to be world class, absolutely iron tight. We need to overhaul the defense starting with a new RB and CB. Same applies for Lloris, a great player for us, but his mistakes cost too much for this tactic to bear.

Exposed in the first half is our sore lack of technical ability in all areas of the pitch, we literally can't play ourselves out of our own half. Things only started opening up when Arsenal are exhausted and defending a lead. 

I am encouraged by our second half performance, but it's not enough, not even close, if we want to play this way we need new players now.

When are we going to develop the fitness to play football beyond 45 mins?",We're completely lost without Bentancur,Well my whole week isn‚Äôt ruined now. Progress.,Much needed from blue balled Son too. Must be a relief that you still got it.,"Shoutout to Bryan and Sarr, they both looked great today.","Son needed to be off, was absolutely shocking today. Nice to grab a point but still feels disappointing.","so, what's today's excuse for Son when there's no Perisic to occupy his space? Who do we blame?",Had no thought of Marseille and their fans until they jeered at an obviously injured player. Get fucked you fucking cunts! Enjoy Europa League... Oh wait,I have this theory that Conte is masterminding the performances 1st to 2nd half to create some comeback warrior mentailty.,I'm not even mad...just resigned to the shower of shit that will be on display week after week while continue to struggle.,,I really don't know why Emerson starts games. Its literal insanity.,Sanchez and Royal should never play together ever again,We were so much worse after the first 2 subs.,"They did everything they possibly could to screw us over.

""Clear and obvious error"".

More than 3 minutes to review the goal and they chalk it off. 

They show the lines and Kane looks about a foot onside. What's more: the ball came off the defender, not Emerson. 

Ridiculous man. 

Just ridiculous.","Couldn‚Äôt do much against the two goals, but the lack of ability to get back in the game is the problem. United were really good in the press and after the first goal they fought tooth and nail to take the momentum out of us trying to get 1 all. Not much you can do with the lack of attacking options but I genuinely think more creative and technical options need to be looked at in January should the budget allow it. As amazing as Conte has been I think he needs his first choice of a LCB and a cm , maybe even a RWB before we can be in a position to get wins like tonight and the emirates as they are both really hard places to play at.",,"Final scoreline aside, we're clearly MUCH better when we allow ourselves the impetus to actually play on the front foot.","I'm all for criticising the manager when needed but today isn't that day. 

When the game settled in the first half we were dangerous on the breaks and the system worked well. 


Lloris and Perisic (a little of Romero as well) had an absolute nightmare and made a massive mistake early in the second half and then the red card.","To be honest, if he‚Äôs not up top or on the left then I don‚Äôt want to see Richarlison on the pitch.

Edit: downvoted because people are still on the honeymoon phase with him but lol he‚Äôs 100% half the player (and I‚Äôm being generous) on the right side.",Scuba Steve kits are undefeated!,"So Son permanent super sub, right? /s",Not ideal for our entire squad to lose their attacking form all at once.,HAHAHAAH REST IN PISS CHELSKI,"I understand why Conte starts Emerson, but how is he so nailed to the point where he starts EVERY SINGLE GAME and plays 90 mins?

The only time he‚Äôs been subbed off with any significant period is against Marseillie and Kulu was 1000000x more threatening

Honestly it baffles me how someone who‚Äôs such a liability in attack is legit a nailed on starter","Lloris - Davies - Dier - Sanchez - back to Dier - back to Lloris - to Sanchez and a long ball.

Rinse and repeat","Wasnt able to watch live, watching it now.

That yellow on Dier and then on Son.... wow","I love our subs and the second level starters. Cant wait to see how good they can mesh on non major games. Kane/Son will need rest with Champions League, EPL and who knows what else gets throw our way. Carabao cup, Masengel tournament and etc","To be honest, Son is known to have slow starts. Look at 2018/2019, he scored his first goal of the season in November. 

The midfield drastically improved in the second half, it‚Äôs really great seeing the height advantage come into play. Perisic was very good, Bentancur never stop running, it‚Äôs insane","Best performance yet? Hit the post twice and could've had more. Richarlison just HAS to keep starting, he plays every game like he has a point to prove"
87,Just so completely and utterly unable to show up for anything important except the random City game to give us all false hope.,"You people don't really care you're only angry in the moment, you'll go to sleep and wake up tomorrow and remember the go karting track, wizkid and the cheese room then smile with happiness then you'll shrug your shoulders, delude yourself with whatever copium you'll tell yourself and sing COYS. 

The more things change the more they stay the same.","What a great game. Our defense really showed up tonight. Romero was always in the right spaces making the right tackles, and Royal was huge in controlling his flank and moving the ball forward. Forster has been a great replacement for Lloris so far, his rough start aside. Wow 

And obviously. Screw the cunts in blue",Can we have stellini in charge for next week please,Conte stop giving the squad a rest after beating City,I'm not too sure what's up with Son. Starting to believe he lost his confidence. He hasn't even tried to shoot when he has the opportunity. We're already halfway through this season and so far he hasn't been the same.,It's amazing how much Arsenal has progressed and equally amazing how much Spurs have regressed in the same amount of time,"We have no excuse, we shouldn't need to buy Porro, Edwards or any other player to beat Forest and Villa. Seriously what happened in Korea? Son has become a worse player than Nketiah, how is that possible??","Genuinely impressed with our performance today. Emerson and Deki link up play is very nice, and Emerson was really hounding Fulham players all match. Impressive day for him. We looked much more comfortable after a slow start, passing calmed down and we just flowed so much more. Definitely looked a lot more comfortable with the game plan set up by Conte.",Richarlison start would‚Äôve been nice.

We concede first.

We haven‚Äôt come out strong in awhile.

Our wingers can‚Äôt deliver if their life depended on it.

Our defense is in shambles.

Hopefully we can resolve this with another midfield option, another attacker, and a quality defender.

I‚Äôm so bored of watching no real threat to goal in the first half.",,Cant wait until jan when hopefully the teams back with no injurys,Incredible comeback!!,"No good takeaways as far as I‚Äôm concerned, besides maybe Betancur doing the job of 3 mfer‚Äôs - big ups to him.

Horrid performance all around. Dier may have overhit 4 relatively easy crosses over the head of an open player into the stands. Son not taking advantage of quality chances he had. Tactically, felt like we never did anything to adjust.

We had *a lot* of players starting today that aren‚Äôt considered *clear* first choice starters, in Contes eyes‚Ä¶ however, in possession, we‚Äôve looked stagnant all season long (w/o Kulu atleast) , today was much of the same. Conte relying on knicking goals from a counter-attacking chance or from corners has left us pale when actually asked to build from the back.

Something‚Äôs gotta change.",What the fuck was that?,So glad we weren‚Äôt interested in any mideiflders with some decent ball skills to help us get out of a press or create something out of nothing. We rely on luck or the sheer brilliance of Kane and Son far too much to have any long term success,,hey we're top of the group,Well. Liverpool is getting face fucked so there‚Äôs that I guess.,"1) Doherty has earned first choice at RWB

And  boy are they playing poorly.,If conte got a red so should tuchel,"Emerson Royal is not a bad player. He just doesn't fit the way we play. He takes far too many touches. Stops counter attacks with his slow playing style. Always feel he's playing in slow motion, always on 75% instead of 100.","If PEH is out for any time for an injury, I swear. No reason to keep him on if he will be out for weeks. We could have brought on Skipp the second half",I was wrong for trashing Richy.,As long conte loves son more than you lot then life‚Äôs good. It seems so easy to forget that we wouldn‚Äôt have made it into champions league without son‚Äôs integral work last season,Great shift from Sanchez. First clean sheet of the season.,richarlison deserved a goal but what a performance from the entire team. lenglet is really going to challenge davies.
88,Wolves made 5 subs before we made 1. Pretty much sums up how that second half went tits up for us. Soundly out-managed,"Well, at least this will reduce the chances that conte is back next year. I can‚Äôt watch him continue to force players into a system that isn‚Äôt suited for them, nor is it getting results, nor is it remotely entertaining to watch.","I know there‚Äôs not a lot of Dier fans here typically,
But he had a great day.",[deleted],Oh well Sarr and Skipp have a big chance to make a name for themselves now. As a player you dream of these moments/opportunities hopefully they can do something special.,"Romero, hojbjerg, bentancur, kane and kulusevski can stay.

Drowning my sorrows at the Bill Nick.,"It‚Äôs surely now the moment where we have two ways to go. Back conte and give him more players for his system or get poch back before we waste money on unsuitable players. Conte only has Hugo, Romero, Perisic, Kane and bentancur as players for his system.  Maybe Son but Son doesn‚Äôt really fit in it despite last seasons heroics. Also Hugo is no a definite question mark and needs replacing.","I‚Äôm thrilled with that win.  100% what we needed. As long as nobody injured, of course. Really hope none of those knocks were serious.

Every single match we are passive and absent in the first half, then show up second half because we‚Äôre behind. Figure it out.",Wins a win!

this was our best chance to win a trophy this year. The carabao is litearlly the most tin-pot cup we can win this season that is still considered a good trophy to celebrate. We played our best 11 when we had tired and weary legs and were absolutely demolished, outplayed, outwitted by litearlly the worst team in the league.

Fucking LINGARD did a fortenite move on us. Arsenal smashed these idiots 5-0. We weren't even close.

The ONLY PERSON TO BLAME is Conte. No one else. He picked this dreadful lineup with 0 legs and Perisic and Kane uptop. YOu know how Conte said he wanted Son to marry his daughter? the reason why he didnt want Perisic to marry her is because Perisic is his illegitimate son. He will do anything to play Perisic out of position. Hes a LW, not LWB, not ST. WINGER. For fucks sake, play GIL. Play SPENCE. Play players that want to run and prove themselves.

Literally the worst team in the league knows if they put even a little bit of pressure on us, well wilt and give them hances.

Really really simple question I want someone to answer for me:

If we have a ruthless win-now manager who does NOT win-now, who forces us to play SHITE football with no progress or long-term process, who forces our superstars like Kane and Son to sit back and wait for hours for a good touch in their half, HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU STILL SUPPORT HIM IF WE ARENT WINNING?????

I have to say though, the scoreline flattered us a bit. We were pretty poor defensively which is understandable due to the attacking changes Conte made to the starting XI. However, we need to find a balance.

Who do you think is responsible for the comebacks? Do you realize how fucking hard it is to be 2-0 down, and score 2 goals while keeping the opponent tame without letting them kill you off on a counter?

So first half is on Conte, but the great second half is on the players? What do you think he does at half time, splash them with cold water? No, he tells them what to do to score.

What can he do about the Dier brainfart? Or Japhet's whole game?

90,"I‚Äôm so so sick of this team. We signed two new wing backs, three new forwards and two cm‚Äôs to ‚Äúfit the system‚Äù and we‚Äôre fucking worse than we were last year","Fielding players like Sanchez, Dier, Davies, Perisic all at once is indicative that this team has not transformed as much as most fans thought it had.

Players like Dier and Davies are great within the context that they have better and more capable players surrounding them. They're just average in all areas of their game without really excelling in one particular facet. This squad has had issues improving because the talent level of Kane, Son (from prior years), and Lloris isn't enough to win trophies because of the dire lack of talent in the bench and the rest of the starting XI. Dier's worst performances and best performances are always dependent on having Romero and even Emerson defending on his right flank. Those two players typically snuff out any hint of danger before Dier has to act. The front 3 playedVERY poorly, but Sanchez and Dier somehow made Ndiaye look like prime Cristiano on that goal. 

You can't win trophies when you consistently field players like Dier, Davies, Sanchez, Winks, Perisic, Lamela, Aurier, Moura etc all at once. Having 1-2 of those players sprinkled in a more talented squad is feasible but not when it's a majority makeup of your starting XI.

In terms of tactics, this team needs to be able to play under different circumstances and branch out of it's 5/3 at the back. When things go wrong it seems like Conte/Stellini can't adapt the formation. Sending Dier running forward can't be enough when your midfield two constantly gets dominated.",Suck on these 3 points Atwell you cunt!,Royal Redemption Continues,Losing Bentancur hurts more than anything else.,Can we get Udogie in now?,"Massive overhaul needed, but likelihood is Levy will rather bin the coach and stick with the failing group of players then do the necessary surgery on the squad. So many players left on the books who are just not good enough, alongside players who just need a new challenge elsewhere.

We haven't replaced in areas where we had real quality - CB Aldeweireld and Vertonghen not fully replaced, Dier and Sanchez still somehow on the books
RB Walker to Trippier to Aurier to Doherty to Royal, an increasing decrease in quality every time
LB - Reguillon off to Madrid, but no one to replace him.
CM - No creative players post Eriksen

Couple those gaps with players who are off the boil this season - Lloris and Son for example and we are in a mess.

There seems to be no plan for the squad - and this group of players will probably lose another coach their post.","We need to spend big, for first team starters not only back up options.",What an atrocious antifootball display. But we won.,Trossard at Arsenal only,"i love kane i love doherty i love sonny

great confidence boost for the team

i don't regret staying up late for this match

coys <3 <3 <3",Fuck I‚Äôll take it,"Not a great performance but we‚Äôve seen worse when we had to put our second team out. Hopefully this results in Emerson getting banished to the bench again, he was a really hard watch. Gil and Sarr can hold their heads up, they weren‚Äôt brilliant but another solid showing from both of them. Son looks like a shadow of himself. These are my main takeaways from the game.",Champions League last seconds are always where we shine,"What would we do without Kulu and Bentancur? 

Without Kulu this is way different game, his ability to get past in the box is second to none, and it allows us to get scoring opportunities that no other player would create. Bentancur was probably having his worst match all season, but turns it around to score the tying and winning goal. 

Negatives:  Dier- He's been poor defensively for about a month now. Maybe it's due to him playing RCB, but his performances are worrying nonetheless. 

Emerson- I'm usually a defender of him, but his weaknesses are being more and more glaring. His defending is supposed to be his strong point, but even on that he's been poor of late. Honestly, I wasn't all bothered about his final third delivery as I am with the lob passes to the middle that just goes to the other team and leads to counter. 

I think Conte's way of just continuously starting him doesn't do him or us any good. As a utility player who comes in the last 20 minutes with the lead, or a player who starts the occasional game, he'd have a place in the squad. But as a starter, it's not working out. I like his personality, but once you start getting booed or ironically cheered nearly every home match, it's probably best to move on. 

Richarlison - He just come back so not too harsh, but I don't think he did anything positive today. Hopefully after the break, he'll start injury free and come back scoring goals.

Hojbjerg-  He was a huge slouch today. He was guilty for the Leeds first goal, and Leeds players were just running past him all match.","Couldn't see the match, but hearing the rational thoughts of everyone here and seeing Chelsea almost A team being absolutely played around by City's B team, Arsenal being knocked out as well, all I can say is the fatigue is being felt by the teams in Europe now.",,"Who the fuck was that ref, genuinely",Almost bottled a mandate to laugh at Chelsea.

Last week and this week are prime examples of when Chelsea won the league. 5-4-1 without the ball. Confident in letting teams play loosely. They‚Äôll get more chances, but have to go through the bus. Counter, counter, counter. 

It‚Äôs not the same style that we‚Äôre used to. You‚Äôre not constantly trying to break teams down. It‚Äôs not individual brilliance. It‚Äôs the team holding shape, making the right pass, and being robotic.

Watching this level of trash football, week in and week out is just embarrassing now.

The only reason why we do well in the second half is teams tend to sit back to try and defend their lead, giving us room to start playing out from the back.

We don't have the players to play a 3-4-3. We don't have the investment to buy the players for a 3-4-3 in the way Conte wants to play. Conte is soo inflexible he refuses to play any other system but the 3-4-3. Something has to give.

What's the point in attacking with our right if the right can't cross a ball or pass,Ryan sessegnon take a bow,"The squad is starting to become a problem

Lloris is close to finished IMO. I love his shot-stopping but he is out of his depth in ‚Äúmodern football‚Äù play. The amount of goal kicks that go straight to the opposition. He‚Äôs not comfortable at all, and it reminds me of how Arsenal changed their GK for attributes like distribution. No disrespect to Hugo, legend for us but there‚Äôs a problem

Doherty is hard to judge consider how little he‚Äôs played this season, but he still looks better than Emerson

Skipp has played 1 game, looked bright today, no comment

Hojbjerg is one of like 3 players I have nothing to say here. Been excellent for us this season, chipped in with goals and assists and yes we missed him today

Sanchez is bordering on pointless. He‚Äôs not necessarily being terrible, but I‚Äôm struggling to see what he offers anymore. Square peg round hole stuff

Son has been shut down completely this season, apart from Leicester. Teams are consistently doubling up on our left wing and leaving our right side with more space. Otherwise it just isn‚Äôt clicking

Richarlison is meant to be a backup, and his efforts to break into the first XI are not working that well in the forward line. He‚Äôs been hot and cold this season imo

Kane is still as crucial as ever, he can barely get into most of the games he plays, which sucks. He‚Äôll steal us a goal ever week anyway though

Gil has been left in his box this season. Not much more to say

Emerson Royal, in this team with this system is just not working. I respect the guy for the effort he puts it, but the writing is on the wall. Not going for consistent option along with Doherty is going to sink us

Perisic can‚Äôt seem to gel with Son on that left side. He offers some actual CROSSING, which is a foreign concept to most of this team, but he feels like a stopgap option

Dier is not good enough to be an unchallenged starting CB for a top 4 team. He will have some great stretches of form, but we honestly need to be looking at another starting CCB in the market to go with Romero.  

Romero is our best CB, and the difference when he is not present is absolutely painful

Sessegnon has looked worse than he‚Äôs actually been. He‚Äôs been able to contribute more on the left side integrating with Son. However our opponents defend us asymmetrically and heavily close down the left side. We haven‚Äôt adjusted to that. Sess weakness is his strength, and against tight marking it‚Äôs not going to work out

Kulusevski has been incredibly important for us this season, better than Son, and his ability to carry the ball and hold up the play is sorely missed. For this style of play we need more players with his ability

Spence is a ghost. For a position which needed some fire, shocking transfer so far

Tanganga is nowhere as well

Lucas is Lucas and offers next to nothing now

Bentancur is in the running for our player of the season, even when the team has been bad you can see him performing. One of our best on the ball

Davies is another one that should be strictly rotation. Just not the quality we need to challenge the way we want to

Lenglet is a new arrival, and despite a shaky start, I see more potential in him then all our CBs bar Romero. At least has some ball-playing abilities as we get pressed to hell

Bissouma hasn‚Äôt really gotten out of second gear this season, idk if he‚Äôs struggling to step up, or learn to play exactly the opposite of how Brighton do, but he‚Äôs not hit the ground running

I get we always talk about the Pochettino days, but it‚Äôs so easy to forget that we had a back 4 that could rival almost any in Europe, prime Lloris, prime Kane, prime Eriksen, Dembele, etc.

Pochettino did a great job but the base of quality in that squad was just incredible","Fuck VAR, we just got robbed and it's ridiculous","Yet again torn apart by another very average team.

Can't complain too much here.,"7 points more as compared to last season.

Always take that.
Great improvement in second half, specially Kane, H√∏jberg, Deki. 

Royal's performances are getting better which is good to see.

And Ivan Perisic... Man is Rolls-Royce. Give him half a yard and he will get a cross through. Excellent signing. 

Sanchez and Dier had a couple moments but did well.

Howe went to Newcastle, yes they bought some players, not world class players, but he's improved what was already there. We've bought new players and got worse. Our established players have got worse, our football is shit. Conte is not the answer when he's basically telling the squad they're not good enough every single transfer window. How we need a lot of new signings every window. JFC show what you can do with what you've got.

Finish your chances and don't let the refs decide the game.,"I thought we would lose prior to the game, but the manner of the defeat was dreadful. I've not seen us constantly outplayed for 90 solid minutes for a long time, this was a lot worse than the Arsenal game.

You can't keep playing the same players with the amount of games we're playing, regardless of squad depth you need a certain amount of rotation to keep players fresh. And what's the point in not making a sub til 80 mins, the game was done by then. As soon as that first goal went in a change was needed, let alone the second goal. I'd rather lose by another goal or two and actually have a go, rather than just accept a defeat and do fuck all the rest of the game.

Our league position flatters us to be honest, the performances have been very poor.

I would very much like to see Richarlison on the left and Kulusevski on the right very soon, but I do see the argument for giving Son the City match: he's almost uniquely potent against them because of his world class movement, pace, and link up with Kane.

Perisic lost the ball several times and completely whiffed a tremendous scoring opportunity, and Porro looked to be completely overwhelmed. Our midfieldees and attackers were completely isolated as a result. I thought Kulusevski and Son were both extremely poor today, but there's not much you can do when you receive the ball and you are completely on your own and outnumbered by Leicester players.

The defenders were also extremely poor, trying ludicrous passes in an attempt to break the press. They were far too easily dragged out of position and looked a complete mess throughout the game.

We conceded 3 goals in 20 minutes in the first half, and yet our first substitution was on the 65th minute, and that was because Bentancur was injured. The next substitution was 10 minutes later. I'm no football manager but that is absolutely baffling to me. We were completely pulled apart during the first half, isn't that a sign that something really needs to be changed at half-time? Why did we keep the same players on? It's seems to be such a terrible decision from Conte. Just absolutely dreadful all round.","Embarrassing not much else to say.

Perisic just destroys the line and I think this is part of Conte's strategy to use him as an 'attacker'. And also remember how he could've passed the ball to Son during one of our closest counterattack yesterday? He genuinely dragged the ball until Son was offside.

The team was pressing more, which really helped making Frankfurt stay at an arms length. Also Bentancur and Hojbjerg dropped deeper, while the wide CB pushed a bit higher, giving Emerson and Perisic a bit more freedom. Any other day we could have scored about 3.","Fascinating tactical battle between Tuchel and Conte.  Spurs sometimes looked like a mess, and I think it was because had some difficulty adapting to the changes in formation that Conte was demanding (particularly with Sess and Royal transitioning between offense to defense and vice versa).  It didn‚Äôt surprise me that the front three looked so quiet because Conte pulled Kulu and Son so narrow and back for defense.  It also didn‚Äôt surprise me that Chelsea‚Äôs second goal came during a Spurs formation transition.  Tuchel demanded the same flexibility out of his squad and their team‚Äôs experience really showed. They were a better trained to adapt than Spurs.

That being said, Spurs‚Äô grit and squad depth really came out. I think the team should be proud of that.  The subs all made a great impact both in energy and execution.  And shithousery won Spurs the game.   Should Romero have been sent off for the Cucurella hair pull?  Yeah, probably.  Should Chelsea fans be angry about it?  Yeah, definitely.  Should Spurs fans celebrate it?  Hahaha hell yeah, cmon now, it‚Äôs football

Overall I don‚Äôt think Spurs played well, but i think this performance has some pretty encouraging signs.  Conte can play a replay of this game to the team and point out specific moments, minute by minute, to each player to show them what mistakes they made and where to improve their decision making.  Chelsea‚Äôs experience with Tuchel‚Äôs tactics was the key to their success in this game, and i think that‚Äôs where Conte wants to take Spurs.

- Richy is the man. 
- Richy-Kane-Kulu ABSOLUTELY has to be the front three on Saturday. I was fine letting Son play through his annual disappearing act when our forward depth began and ended with Lucas, but that's not the case anymore.
- The midfield is the the midfield, both in performance and tactics, but I'm really intrigued to see who we use on Saturday. Biss being a final 10 replacement is a waste of a talented player and first appearance of the season against City seems like asking a lot of Skipp.
- Royal was Royal. His end product is a mess but he ran his ass off and was excellent defensively. 
- If Doc is healthy he needs to play more. I love what Royal provides defensively but the Doc-Deki linkup was vital last year and our attack has been trash most of the season.

For people calling Conte out, seriously? Our squad depth (midfield and back) we know is a problem. We are also dealing with injuries to pivotal players.

I would gladly take this organization in it‚Äôs current state than when I started watching 20 years ago. Positivity people!!! COYS","That first goal is still a complete farce, and Newcastle are truly world class time wasters, but we have ourselves to blame. No real options on the bench, our forwards still not putting away chances when we are dominating, and individual defensive errors costing us.",[removed],It‚Äôs shocking how bad we‚Äôve been in so many games.,,how Hasabe managed to stay on the pitch is beyond me,"Not surprised we lost. Thought we would pre-game. Not because we're worse than them, but just because that's what happens.

Every single season for the past half decade, Arsenal have had the home fixture first, win it, get loud, we win the return game, finish above them.

Since 08/09, we've played at the Emirates first and WHL second in 12 of the last 15 seasons. It's baffling scheduling and really does put us at a disadvantage given the margin for error later in the season is far less.

Arsenal are improved this year, but they've still done nothing yet to prove they're genuinely different to last season. They lost to United and beat us in the same fixtures. Beating Brentford and Palace isn't enough. Go beat Liverpool comfortably next week and I'll probably believe them more, even though it's a weak Liverpool team atm.

Just knew it wasn't our day when a rapist scored the opener.",Worried about Richarlison and Deki though,Man of the match = Gian Piero,Must say GREAT fucking subs from Conte this time. Credit where credit is due.,"Whilst frustrating, this certainly seems at least a better overall performance than some games recently. 

The passing from the midfield seemed to find people more and the front 3 seemed to be getting found, just seemed like kane and son particularly were gassed.

 Sess looked pretty good when he came on and gave a bit more of what we seemed to need.

Kulu definitely seems to be the missing link in producing that killer ball :(","CONTE FUCKING BLEEDS LILY WHITE. 

I fucking love our club. Our signings love us. This game was full of everything. Conte makes me always believe that no matter what, we‚Äôll score. Kept telling my girlfriend we can do this. Yeah we didn‚Äôt win but felt like this was our off game. And if our off game can be this, I‚Äôm all for it. Great teams find a way to scrape points even when they‚Äôre shit that day. Look at West Ham and United and I fucking laugh/feel sad hahaha.

Amazing game. Conte fucking loves us, once a loyal blue scum, now fucking coys in his veins. Ref let a lot of fouls go. This man hopefully will go down as a legend (Conte) for us.

Perisic was fantastic. We did this without Son! We have fucking depth. We have a squad that loves each other and fights till the last min. I support anyone on this team to get better and Emerson was great.

Front 3 looked once again struggled to even show signs of what makes them so good. But 1 thing that is clear is that last season, I don't think they would have pulled out the win in this game - and there is nothing more important than that. 

This team has pulled more points than they probably deserved 2 games in a row now, and if they can continue this the whole season, I'd say title chances might just be a thing.","I enjoyed this more than our 4-1 victory over Southampton.

When teams can score that easily often from their first shot on goal you need to completely get rid of this defense.

ENIC need to take a real look and decide what they want from spurs. They can‚Äôt say we are ‚Äúbig team‚Äù when they aren‚Äôt spending like one, or winning any trophies to back it. So either sell the club, or admit you are mid-table team that only care about profit and not trophies or winning.

He goes on to play in every match the rest of the season and Royal is shipped off in January. Let‚Äôs gooooo,"The most embarrassing part of this defeat will be the section of fans who celebrate this as some kind of victory because they pretend not to care about silverware and think less fixtures will help this broken mess of a team.

Didn‚Äôt get any of the breaks today. Perisic off the frame of goal twice. Bentancur a couple inches from heading one home. Llenglet couldn‚Äôt get the ball down on a header. 

But also, Deki is so important to this team.","Bentancur has been our best player this season. It's really unbelievable to me how much I'm starting to love him. I'd honestly argue that he's been the bigger bargain between him and Deki. Yes Deki helped us a lot but I think it's the classic striker bias because he has direct goal involvements, but it's honestly Bentancur imo. He's the one that makes the team click.","Honestly I might be missing it or not remembering, but has Perisic ever cut it back to Son...

Skipp and Romero were phenomenal as well.

Probably the most fluid, patient, and composed we've been in possession all season. I don't want to speculate too much, but the excellent performances when Conte isn't on the sidelines are becoming a pattern. Can't help but think his constant micromanagement from the bench is stifling some of our creativity and freedom.

He definitely brings an incredible energy and has contributed well, but there's just a lot more cohesion between son and Kane and Deki, s as you'd expect. It will come with time, but we didn't really have that connection working today from the start. That combined with a ton of absolutely wasted possession and top-notch embarrassment from Anthony Taylor. Just not our day.

Sure, blame Royal or whatever, but we never really had it in general today. All the other things just added to the pain.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

More in-depth: 

My initial thoughts;

>fantastic game from the team overall ; midfield fantastic and same as wingbacks (Doherty and Perisic were immense! Now with Sonny and Kane Showing their class and, if they go to back to their best forms like we know Sonny and Kane will do along with the team overall improving and incorporating Gil, Sarr, etc and our obvious ‚Äúbigger‚Äù signings like Ricky. It‚Äôs very promising for the future.

But considering we‚Äôre 2nd in the PL table and 1st in our CL groups when we were not doing ‚Äúwell‚Äù. Is a goddamn blessing and testament to how far the club has come since we hired Conte. It‚Äôs pretty remarkable.

Yet people were criticizing or calling for a sack..  Conte and the players (sometimes justifiably) when the players start to get back in from (for some of them) and for some to learn to system! I am so fucking excited. 

Also bissouma.. goddamn. He will unlock Pierre and Benny‚Äôs playmaking and goal scoring capabilities so much more. I always said Pierre needs to be that box to box midfielder and is getting even better on the offensive aspects while keeping up his great defense. 

Now same applies to Benny (my fianc√©e and I just refer to him as Benny so sorry for any confusions) 

-I‚Äôve argued with PEH haters since he joined.. ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not technical, not suited for top 6 teams, he‚Äôs too slow, he‚Äôs sideways/back pass merchant etc etc‚Äù but they‚Äôre so damn wrong if they just watched him play box to box before and like he‚Äôs doing now with us and the NT. He‚Äôs getting better and better and it‚Äôs amazing to watch.

Doherty, class game from him and clearly showed from Conte‚Äôs reaction. Djed‚Äôs debut is very significant to me since it shows Conte saw the improvement and that he‚Äôs now learning the system. 

-Big, positives signs for us in our wingback/creativity issue because we sorely missed that attacking presence. Doherty and Perisic were able to bring. And it‚Äôs positive to me because even players like Sess has clearly been improving since he joined but now, He was doing more right footed passes, tried a right footed cross, etc that Perisic would do. 

-And now Djed‚Äôs debut, him running into the box, tracking back into formation naturally.. I can see him being one of our most important signings in recent history (same goes for Udogie). but I say this because of how reliant we are in the system and the players are willing to work hard knowing that Conte will be a man of his word and play them. I know this was literal minutes of a debut, I‚Äôm talking in the overall scheme of things.

Also I just want to say, I REALLY think Conte could think of a longer run with us than his other past clubs for a couple of reasons  honestly
-from things like this and genuine remembering of Gian and his impact on everyone from players to our fans..

-based on team improvements ever since we first signed Conte as our manager even where Conte say it would have been a miracle to make top 4 yet he did.. (and still heard people wanted to fire Conte before this?! Fucking ridiculous  fans who I doubt are Spurs fans too. Sorry for the short rant on that. Haha

-financially backing him and clear discussions with him, Fabio, etc are working. 

-seems like Conte has more emotional connection to the club since he did bring us to CL last year and with the players and club now carrying on Gian‚Äôs legacy and future hopes for the club based on that.. I think as a club, we will always remember the impact Gian had for us so it‚Äôs amazing to see us try and make him proud","Big result at a tough place after a tough week.

Find it bizarre that Conte barely changed things up.,"The only thing I find concerning is that Moyesh plan of ""lull them into a false sense of security"" from first half to second half worked lol.

I am shocked Conte fell for it.","Anybody see Richarlison with his family/friends just after full time? Man basically bawling emotionally.

He, in my opinion, is the fight, passion, and emotion we've needed in a while. Been missing at the very least since Lamela left if not before. 

I was super skeptical when we signed him - boy, am I so glad to have been proven wrong.","Don't understand the negativity. We're not playing flowing beautiful football sure but that was never Conte's trademark. Yes we struggle, but now all teams are playing high quality and are fighting for every point so every game is extra tough. I am impressed of this team in spite of not playing great - we have the best possible results and points outcome. Our defence looks so much better... we just picked back to back clean sheets with Sanchez - Dier - Davies. One year ago everyone'd cringe seeing that defence and expect the worse. Physically we dominate or match our opponents past the 60th minute mark which also was not a thing 1 year ago. We are less reliant on a particular player (Whether its Kane, Son, Deki, Dele, Eriksen or anyone else) than ever before. As for Son, my guess the preseason took its toll on him and now he's in a bit of a confidence block. He needs to be given 1-2 games time off to recover but its ridiculous to even suggest that people hate him or that he should be sold. The pressure is unwarranted and theres nothing positive that will come out of this.

Remember that this is a different season with a world cup in the middle and a brutal 2 games per week period that begins next week. We have to pace ourselves in order to keep the good shape as long as possible. That means that yeah, a lot of the games will be hard to watch but I am absolutely confident, more than never before in the succes of this team.

As for this game, I think Deki played quite good and was the most consistent threat of the trio. Today his end product lacked but so far I'm more and more convinced by him and I just love his direct forward thinking. Really good player. Its a bit of a bummer Bissouma hasnt been given minutes but he will have plenty time to plqy dont worry.

Thats all I have to say. Trust in Conte, and the players, we're 100% finishing in top 4 and above Scum in particular.","We'll take the 3 points. 2nd half performance pretty good, first half was very poor.

We still appear weak in midfield, and this team still needs time to gel into what Conte wants. It's clear we're not there consistently yet. Still, 7/9 points with these three fixtures to start the season is fantastic","I loved our tenacity. Passing improved. Lenglet and Romero big difference makers. Betancur showed his usual smooth operator skills, son was absurdly unlucky but we played well. Very happy. COYS"

Otherwise, a day of grandma's house-sized servings of shit.",This side has scored in both halves of a game just ONCE in their last 19 (in all comps). The fact that they have not put together a complete 90 performance since probably Brighton more than 3 months ago speaks volumes.,"Terrible performance. The only reason we looked marginally better in the second half is because Arsenal took their foot off the gas. That two man midfield is going to be the death of me. 

Maybe Sess will do a KWP but I just can‚Äôt see it. He‚Äôs so timid. Lloris is done and it makes me sad. Romero is a great defender who often exhibits poor decision making, he gave the referee so many opportunities to give him a second yellow. 

Son is so difficult to talk about, yes it‚Äôs partially the tactics and lack of service but there is something not right there, hasn‚Äôt been right for a long time, and it‚Äôs hard to have a rational discussion here about his decline due to the number of people who defend him at all costs.

Allardyce football, just punt it to N√∫√±ez or Salah and hope for the best. We actually played decently but there's only so much you can do when you have a LWB that is so unsure of himself and a RWB that is 0% effective. Emerson might be more effective as a RCB but I'd rather he just be sold.

I'm really like Davies and Lenglet where they're playing. Lenglet is much better CCB than Dier. Speaking of Dier. How many brain dead moments does this guy have? It's silly, he has a lot of them and gets away with a lot. Normally when he plays CCB he just punts the ball away but when he's at RCB he cant?!

When Deki came on he infused so much drive and impetus into the play. Doherty really needs to start. His attacking threat is miles above Emerson and is one of the few players that regularly attacks the goal and makes runs.

Also fuck the ref.",They didn‚Äôt give up even faced with the Emerson-Sanchez handicap,"Lloris succession plan should be a priority next summer.

That being said, if we start the same 11 people in the Brighton match I'll be very worried. We were supposed to have depth, how long before these players are run into the ground?","How has no one acknowledged that Kane scored in August and is off the mark in the League? Did he have a shocking game along with the rest of the lads?.....fuckin' A. 

Did he still bag one to steal a point at the Bridge and turn the valve of Chelsea tears wide open?.........also fuckin' A.","Potentially unpopular opinion: I don't think we deserved to lose that match. We didn't deserve to win, necessarily, but a draw was on the cards for sure. We did well enough to keep them out for ninety minutes, and in the second half (especially once Kulusevski came on) we had the bulk of the chances overall. We just lacked timing and final product. Losing 2-0 is infuriating and disheartening, but I would argue also a bit harsh given our overall performance

That said, Sporting are genuinely a good team, and away matches in Europe are a tricky proposition no matter who we're up against. Conte should absolutely have been more proactive with his substitutions and this loss is partially on him, but give Sporting some credit here ffs",Call me crazy but I‚Äôm content with 11 out of 15 considering the 4 dropped our London derbies away from home,What a second half. Happy for Richarlison. Has to start against City.,"Sign of a good side is even when you're not playing well you still win. Spurs have been pretty sloppy all season, yet here we are on 3 wins and a draw.","These games are always going to be difficult and tbh the past seasons we wouldn‚Äôt have won this game or would have conceded a late goal. Tbh, as much as Wolves did in the first half, even with the sub, I was never really concerned about their threat. However, we have a habit of starting slow in the first half and then waking up in the second half this season.

Not the most entertaining thing to watch when you‚Äôre hungover on a Saturday though.

Sanchez did well, obviously not the same passing quality as Romero but he handled himself well and was a wall in defense.

Richarlison is easily becoming a fan fave. He‚Äôs so direct with the ball. Created basically 2 chances on his own with just hard work alone. I would like to see him earlier on as well.

Perisic is class. Dude can get a cross in with even the tightest marking against him.",The passing this match looked so much more fluid. Bentancur Romero and Lenglet made such a tremendous difference. MOTM has to go to Bentancur though he was running his ass off all match playing tremendous defense and moving the ball forward on offense too. Stellar performance from him

THE REFEREES A WANKER!","I keep saying it and I'm going to keep saying it, I fucking LOVE Bentancur, what a man.

We have sjown on our last 3 games we can take control at the drop of a hat, lets just drop that hat quicker lads.","Absolutely ridiculous how much time wasting Nick Pope was allowed to get away with there. Complete joke how the refs are ""clamping down"" on it this season.","Deki Gill Bentan are the future!

Im proud of him!","If he‚Äôs hesitant on playing 3-5-2 and insists on 3-4-3 why not try a 3-4-1-2? Kulu or Kane as the attacking mid. Bit of a hybrid approach that could give us more strength in middle, without sacrificing the back system and the attack?","
Romero my MOTM today, he was immense. Best CB in the world. Bentancur close second, one of very few times he‚Äôs been better than H√∏jbjerg, who of course also had a good game

106,"A draw would have been the fair result, with a loss being a harsh one. 

I'm not entirely sure what the Spurs management are seeing in Sonny-Perisic to get them to keep playing together. It's simply not working. The system doesn't suit your best players, so why does the management keep insisting on it? I genuinely can understand and wouldn't hold it against Kane if he doesn't extend and wants out at this point. This is some fucking awful fossil football. 

Perisic and Hojbjerg were simply fucking awful today. There's no two ways about it. I want to see Richy and Danjuma succeed but with Perisic on that left wing, there is simply nothing coming to you. It's all going into the box at a 20% success rate. Udogie should have been at Spurs already instead of fighting for nothing with Udinese. Hojbjerg was uncharacterisically shit today. It was one of those matches that made me understand the supporters that called him a ""cement mixer""",Fuck this club and I‚Äôll see you all on Saturday,He‚Äôs won every game though,"Is Kilpatrick being serious with his ratings?

Son and PEH were brilliant but it was a ton of meh besides that. We should be stepping on a team‚Äôs throat up 3-1 with a man advantage. Instead we sleepwalk and let them back in it. Liverpool went up 2-1 and then finished the game off 7-1 today. I know they are struggling this year, but that‚Äôs a champion mentality. We are lucky we were gifted the easiest group draw. We better smash Sporting at home next UCL match.

Also I can‚Äôt stand to watch Emerson play in one of our most crucial positions. Being a nice and charismatic guy isn‚Äôt enough. The dude is awful.","Well I think the first 10-15 minutes of each half were completely shit and that cost us the game. Also of course Emersons stupidity. You can give a red for that, it‚Äôs just unbelievably stupid by Emerson. 

Also a big problem was that we are just forgetting to mark players in defense. We drop so deep but there are still opponents completely open on the edge of the box. Why do we need to double a player that is standing right infront of a CB and leave others open around the penalty area? That happened not just at the 1-0, it happened so often. They can pass around and shoot how they want and give players like Jesus or Martinelli the space to dribble. Conte should have adjusted to a 3 man midfield way earlier. 

Like others I‚Äôm kinda glad that Conte is forced to use another wing back now. Doherty looked good if we forget about that cross in our box or maybe give Kulusevski a chance to start at RWB. Also 352 has to be the option now. That 343 just doesn‚Äôt well against most opponents, because everyone overloads the midfield nowadays.

And also, if you don't want your hair pulled In the box, don't show up to the game looking like a test subject for a barber college.","We look so disillusioned. Like this squad has been together for years and are just going through the motions. We bring in loads of players and play none of them. We have a supposedly world class coach who doesn't manage the game. 

Who wants to play for Spurs? Kane again because he got a new manager and is supposedly settled now. Son who spends his best years here and loves it but for what reward? Hojberg who gives 110 percent and doesn't get a rest and has no one to pass it to stretching his abilities. 

I was unphased by the loss. It was not surprising. If we do not win on the weekend or at least play like we want to, it will not be good though. We have been playing poorly for too long and fans will have an excuse to dig in. 

I don't mean to be doom and gloom but this is just how things have presented themselves for the entire season.","What an awful performance from the whole team. Everytime we get any semblance of forward momentum we back pass it 3 times back to the keeper and restart. First touches were sloppy, our midfield got ran over, and our passing in general was slow and rigid. Even when they equalized there was no urgency to get the go-ahead goal until the last 10 minutes. I will say though perisic looked really sharp even when he was getting tired towards the end. He was the one bright spot today in an otherwise horrendous performance.",Marseille Fans throwing flares at Spurs fans now. Nasty cunts.,"I don't think Son was bad. Not up to his standards last season but he threaded a few good balls that could have been assists. I have to say they organised a good defence. I wonder if it's Conte's regiment. Maybe Conte needs to figure something out with Heung Min Dad.

Kulu was bright but his path to goal and shots were very quickly blocked. Kane is Kane, clinical, could have had a had trick but Henderson turned it up today. Good for him, better than rotting at United. Should have signed him and loaned to Forrest. 

Richy is.. perfect. Acting President of the Spurs Shithouse Squad. Of course, could have been perfect-er if he scored or created another goal from the 2 chances.

His curling pass from the outside of his foot was *Chefs kiss*. Finishing needs work but looked bright in the limited time he played.

Perhaps my glasses are rose tinted but I think he should get some games ahead of Son. Nobody here hates son by the way, we just think Richy deserves more time. I have no doubts Son will get his goals flowing, but it really is unfair to limit Richy's time and expect him to perform in the short time he plays.

Our midfield engine is strong. Bentancur and Hojbjerg are incredibly underrated. I love the former especially, in the past four games, he made so many tackles to save us. Just focus on him and you will see how important he is.

Bissouma showed great qualities the short time he was on. Unlike our other 2 midfielders who throw themselves at the ball, he is efficient and extinguishes attacks with the slightest movements. Class.

Emerson better in defence than attack. Good for us the past few games as we haven't dominated any. I would say he is rather lacking in confidence attacking wise.

I really liked what I saw from Spence, he will be the perfect Conte wing back. Team seems hesitant passing to him but boy, do we have a future great on our hands.

Sess and Perisic equally good. Perisic is above critique for now. Sess is one step away from being mercurial (or filming mercurial ads).

Defence was good, but caught out of position at times. I would say Sanchez is the best of the bunch today. And perhaps for the previous game too. Rock solid.

Hugo must be wondering if Sissoko taught the NF players how to shoot. So many rockets overhead.","Personally I think people aren‚Äôt giving Deki enough credit for his performance today, he was a standout for me in the second half. Although we‚Äôve come to almost expect a goal contribution from him, he easily could‚Äôve gotten one or even two assists on a different day. Obviously, the cross to Kane, cutting back on his left (51‚Äô) but also the cutback on his right from the byline to Kane (62‚Äô) and the pass to Son cutting back onto his left (63‚Äô). All in all I thought he had very high energy levels and played well.","No coincidence that Lenglet, Bentancur, Sess and Richarlison were among the best performers today. Hungry players looking to impress and get into the first 11."

* Unbeaten in August, and despite not great performances, we have gotten results in games that previous years we would have struggled to such as tonight and chelsea away. 
* We haven't looked amazing but Son is having a very slow start and will find form. 
* Tonight was the first start for Bissouma and our first time getting a real look at hojberg + bissouma combo so it's very harsh to see some of the comments here. When skipp is fully fit and bentancur is back we have so many more options. Although I would love to see a good midfield signing.
* We really miss Romero in games like tonight because playing out from the back is way better when we have him and that was our biggest problem tonight imo. Sooner he's back the better.
* On a positve note, Kane has been playing fanstastic and Richarlison looks brilliant too. Kulusevski is so close to playing brilliant too it'll definitely come right for him again.","Never really got dully out of 2nd gear, but Conte's subs were effective and Deki changed the game imo","Did everyone really think we'd be out here smashing teams like the end of last season?

What a time that was,This should help transfer window,"The Conte out people need to shut the fuck up. We‚Äôre top 4 going into the break despite injures to key players and the dip in form from Son. You can see Conte‚Äôs tactics work, but there are a couple players that we need upgrades on in order to truly unlock this teams potential. So tired of all of the brain dead takes and people shitting on this team. This team has fight, works together, and when in form can challenge for the title. Conte has instilled all of that and there isn‚Äôt an available manager in the world who could do better.",Blessing in disguise tbh. Obviously since we‚Äôre Spurs we can‚Äôt be picky about trophies but we‚Äôd be lying to ourselves if we thought any team but City were winning it. Now we can focus on comps that actually matter.,,"Far better team in the 2nd half, but Conte making the lucas sub at the 88' is just a killer. Either make the sub sooner, or don't make it at all. Giving someone less than 5 minutes to make an impact is just stupid. Admit something isn't working and change it sooner.",WE ARE CORNER FC!,"We should be doing everything in our power to get Udogie here in January. I can't watch much more of Sessegnon and Perisic. I also miss when Son could finish. 

When the wheels fall off when playing this kind of football is difficult to get them back on, Conte has to change something immediately. No desire to get the draw/win in the 2nd half, players look bored and to be honest can't entirely blame them. Going into a critical CL game with very low confidence could spell all kinds of trouble.","Can't believe it's 1-1. Unreal, fans pay big money for VAR bollocks like that.","absolute dross, can‚Äôt recall a single goal chance we had",,Why is no one talking about that save from Hugo? Maybe it looked mundane on the TV but from our view that shot looked like a sure goal till Hugo pops his hand up and palms it away.,"Son is completely neutralized in the current formation and lineup. I would say put two on top with Son and Kane. Or take Perisic out if he‚Äôs going to stick to three up top‚Ä¶. I wouldn‚Äôt even mind a Richarlison Son duo up top either.  

Perhaps Conte is really forcing Son to play midfielder since there are no options there‚Ä¶Betancour played courageously today.","Keep it simple 
Is kulusevski fit ? Yes 433, no 352",Doherty was really good today,This was the first game I have ever gotten to see live. HES BACK BABY!!!!,"Biggest shock of the night was when the commentator said Kevin Trapp was French. 
I couldn't have been the only one who heard that on BT?!

He's so German and has actually played for the national team.",Fucking robbery. Love it!!,"Honestly the systems strengths are not worth the weaknesses. We get overrun in midfield, and have nearly no creation/ runs into the box from that area, and the majority of our final third actions rely on emerson or perisic to make something happen. Not to mention we play 3 atb, when we arguably have 1 top 4 quality CB, and none that can play out of the back reliably. I'm tired Robbie....",A points a point. If I'm disappointed by anything it's Conte's lack of subs in the second half. Subbing on new wingbacks even at 80 minutes could have added a lot of impetus to our attack. Not a great match overall by us but to be fair it was on short rest.,"Son will return to form. I hope he doesn‚Äôt get shit on too much by fans or at all. Deserves more time and respect.

Richarlison man.. if no one has heard his story, I would watch this: https://youtu.be/uRD-o77FOzI

Really made me learn to like the guy while he was at Everton after watching him explain his tough childhood and it shows why he‚Äôs so damn passionate on the pitch. I love it.

At the end of the day, it was a game to stay level headed, go for the win after drawing the red. We drew Southampton when they had 10 men I believe.. I thought same would happen here. It‚Äôs beautiful now that we have other people who can assist and score without Kane and Son.

Also, ref is nuts",Pru pruuuu,Perisic is brilliant. Start Bissouma and Richarlison.,"We should be a lot more clinical. Mind boggling how many chances we wasted.

Feel bad for Richarlison because he played very well and deserved a brace at least. Was a bit unlucky with the shit that hit the post and then barely missed the goal line.

Overall a solid performance. Think we scramble a little bit in defense sometimes or we needlessly invite pressure. Players will back pass to Lloris at the worst possible times so then he makes a frantic clearance.

Bentancur is exceptionally tidy and I‚Äôm appreciating him more and more. Knew he was one of our best, hence why he starts, but when he‚Äôs not playing it‚Äôs very easy to miss his precise and calm passing and progression.

Hojbjerg is underrated. He has always had a goal in him for us and is a dedicated ballwinner and passer. 

Overall good match, just wish we were more clinical because we can‚Äôt afford to miss these chances in more important matches"
110,I think the main problem is Conte is #ConteOut,Tectonic plates move faster than Forster.,"Forster brilliant again, the big man deserves some credit","Good for Son but I'd prefer Richarlison still starts the next few games and Son is used as a sub. Richarlison looks more accustomed to playing more central.

Ben Davies, PEH and Emerson putting in MOTM performances.",Wouldn't be wrong to call it worst performance of the season,he's out I think,"we really need conte to try a new system, correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to remember him doing that at Chelsea and them going on a great run.","Obviously, sacking Conte would be an extremely reactionary, if cathartic move right now. I totally believe Conte's management is why Spurs rose from the ashes last season to make top 4, and I think that his half-time talks have lit a fire under Spurs' asses to come from some tough deficits.

But we also have to acknowledge that his tactics have often gotten us into those deficits, and the players week in and week out, even with expensive new additions, look very uncomfortable playing in Conte's system. They look like they're drowning from the first whistle sometimes, or they play decently, but never take the chances, and eventually make avoidable errors at the back.

I'm not saying Conte out - even if Poch comes back tomorrow, Spurs have a tough schedule ahead, are already in poor form, and would have do a complete U-turn to a different style of play. It would be a disaster, in the short term at least.

But I do agree it is time for the morons who run this club to actually ask themselves, what is our long term strategy? If Conte doesn't stay  (which he won't, as he keeps making clear), why waste another transfer window buying players that would only fit in his system? Don't sack him immediately, but buy players that have historically had MASSIVE success at this club. Namely - an attacking midfielder, like Maddison, or Eze even, someone who can attack the space behind Kane and Son. Start approaching Poch or others (I'd be kind of interested in Thomas Frank, ngl) right now.

Even though it has been absolute torture watching us play almost every game this season, I do think Conte is a great manager. But his rigid tactics are clearly starting to hurt the team, and he's not interested in staying long term. Results like this only make that more painfully obvious.",Who needs Son when we have EmerSon,I don‚Äôt know wanna speak for the future but I wanna speak into existence so COYS THIS IS OUR YEAR,Can we take a moment and talk about PAPE ??

I don't ever want to hear about this game again.",Davies had strong impact this game. Made the overlapping run to give Perisic space to cut right and cross for the first goal. Then a great block at the end to save the clean sheet. Not saying he is better than Lenglet but well done Ben!,New rule: someone kicks Richie in the nuts to get him going.,"tldr: Great teams play like shit sometimes but find a way to win. 

This Spurs team is different where I‚Äôm not worried if we look like shit in the beginning or have a slow start. It‚Äôs been a pattern of that and then us adjusting. Richarlison was great, started slow but Conte half time magic works. Emerson improving every game. World class players produce even if they‚Äôre playing like shit. Going to love the salt from our rival fans :). We‚Äôd have lost this game 2 years ago.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-


-Perisic is absolutely fantastic. Like .. what the fuck. We got him on a free?! Needs to be more selfish for the shot but love to see he is finding teammates. And another assist.

-Pierre has been one of my favorite players in the squad and it sucked to see him be severely criticized under a microscope. His forward passing is great. I hope people see that now.. that he‚Äôs not some back/sideways passer. His defense has been great since he‚Äôs joined and always gets us a goal in the most crucial times it seems. Loves the club and I hope fans that didn‚Äôt like him start to support him now. 

-Kulu had a slow start along with everyone in the front three but his class and skill clearly shows every game. His touch, passing, movements. Absolutely will be class for us.

-Emerson was great to me as well. One of the only ones that played well the full 90 imo. He‚Äôs improving every game and that‚Äôs just really amazing to see. 

-Son had the worst game of the short season so far. Terrible touches, passing, movement, decision making.. it‚Äôs one of those rough patches he has every season but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs in the beginning and we have a team to support him if he doesn‚Äôt do well. He started doing better in the 2nd half but still wasn‚Äôt as effective as Richarlison. As fans, I hope we have his back and support him since we know the class that he has. 

-Richarlison was great in his cameo. Dribbling past multiple defenders, getting crowded and breaking out of it with fancy dribbling, pressing workrate is great as usual. I‚Äôm very happy with this deal and excited about what he can bring. Sonny has an off day? Richarlison on the bench. Amazing feeling

Conte is an amazing manager and I would love to hear one of his half time team talks when we‚Äôre playing like shit like this. 

Hope everyone has a great weekend! COYS.

Edit: Wanted to shout out Bentancur as well. Had some slick moments and got out of dangerous situations easily while being progressive with the ball. Defense was solid as well. Obvious difference when we have Big Dave vs Romero but he did the job, had a nice block as well.",Had to work early so I missed the match but I'm happy to hear we performed well

Contes introduction of a strict fitness regime had people complaining. But it's paying dividends. You don't win from behind so many times without having superior fitness. Leeds were running on empty at the end, we were still going strong. 

I repeat my comment from almost a year ago ... 

People are complaining about signing ""juve rejects"" but Bentancur is world class. Him and Hojbjerg in the middle will dominate.

And Richy needs to start a game, he's a menace",I will hear no Pierre Emile H√∏jbjerg slander,"So many positives from this game. Overall, much better energy, composure in possession and confidence. Granted there are some obvious reasons for that (starting mainly with the back 3). 

Lenglet and Romero were so instrumental today and really gave Hugo the options we needed to build out of the back. The confidence they inspire under pressure really seemed like the difference maker today in our ability to possess the ball and play in transition well. 

When we have the added options and pressure of the 3 cb's pushing wide and into the midfield it frees up benta and hobby to get some creative movement and passing going. Also seems like both H &B appeared way more confident in possession and working out through the back with those 3 in place. 

Others here said it but Lenglet is a heck of a player if we were only planning to use him as a stop gap. I love me some Davies but I think we ought to give Lenglet a run of games. His passing and composure on ball are class. 

Richy was definitely the highlight for me, incredible work rate, world class shithousery, and unbelievable link up and a near goal. Really cannot wait to see him get more starts and minutes. Suspect he will be the signing of the summer. 

Emerson is just getting better match after match and its great to see. The dude has a fucking motor and we can really benefit from having someone who is so defensively solid if we play our more progressive CB's (Lenglet, Romero). 

Sess was decent but misplaced a few passes in some dangerous areas that will really punish us against better teams. I hope he gets his jitters out because he looked nearly there today but just slightly off.

All in all, great performance from the team and a step in the right direction. We can't get so pessimistic after one tough draw away and a start that hasn't seen us 100% play the football we want to see. Conte is working the system and it seems to be working (look at our relative results to last year).

Should‚Äôve won that game.,Yeah as soon as I saw that early on the game I know it was going to be a shit show,This was immense. It‚Äôs all about survival until after the WC. Conte knows it. Scrape a few more points out of the next few fixtures and prepare for 2023.,"Don‚Äôt let these last minute results mask how bad the team is, serious questions have to be asked about Conte and how he‚Äôs producing a lineup featuring clowns like Emerson every week. We need a big January but I‚Äôm not sold on Conte‚Äôs choice of targets if he thinks Emerson is a talent",On the bright side I think this will finally convince Conte that Sanchez just ain't it. Can't wait to see him start again at the weekend COYS,,"That challenge on Sess should've been a pen. At about 32 mins in Trent does the exact same thing to Sess and it's given as a free kick, wish the ref would be consistent.

Brilliant effort,"obvious props to Sonny, but fucking hell what a midfielder Bentancur is. still posit that he‚Äôs our best. 

probably got his MOTM stolen from him by our half our hero (not complaining) but hopefully that performance makes the footballing world start to realise what a machine he is.","Pretty frustrating for sure (stats might tell a different tale), but I did notice we were able to produce some good chances, including chances for both Kane and Son.  Regretfully we weren't able to convert on any of them.  We are still having trouble in connecting in the midfield and our wingbacks are still bad.  Gil, regretfully, has a long way to go in terms of strength- but the way he has been doing in Valencia and the refusal for him to go on leave, I expect Conte to give him more chances- he owes Gil that much.

I actually spent some time today in watching Son's goals last season, and really noticed again how much Moura and Deki has provided those assists for him.  I am sure Kane has also received a lot from them as well.  

We need them back to fitness soon.

Richarlison - seems like the perfect Son sub, he‚Äôs so direct in his play aswell, fantastic 

Kulusevski - as soon as he got the ball in the second half you had the feeling we could score.

What stood out for me this season is how the addition of Richarlison completely affected the way we attack. It used to be Kane dropping deep to find Son instinctively. Now that we have Richarlison it is very crowded up top, and this requires intricate passing and interlink play in tight spaces. We do not have the players for that. Son no longer plays as winger who takes on his man, nor can Richarlison. The only player who can take his man on atm is Kulusevski.

\- overall, we don't know what to do with the ball when pressed. 3-5-2 is not working.

\- horrible game from Sess

\- Game could have landed on our lap if our keeper did not screw up and if we scored at the beginning

\- if we are 100% dominated every time we play against a big 7 team that means we deserve 7th place

\- we will suffer until after world cup when hopefully Kulu and Rick will be back.",offside or not we made our own bed.  loved the intensity at the end but it was too little too late,We were atrocious. Lloris is the only reason it wasn‚Äôt 6-0.,,"COYS!  Glad to get the win with a poor start and poor finish.  

Most importantly - some more success on the break with Son today.  He controlled the ball well and had 6 shots on target.  Fantastic work.  I really think a key factor in some of our difficult games has been a poor first touch and off-target passing from our forwards.  Today was better -- or at least that middle 60 minutes was.

I didn't think Skipp & Bissouma were good or strong enough.  I don't have examples, but Frankfurt did too well that final 10 minutes.

Really happy with Sess at LB.  He seems to be developing well and I like his demeanor on the pitch.",Guys‚Ä¶ gonna say I‚Äôm glad Emerson got a red. We were probably gonna lose that game anyway and at least now we finally get someone else on the RWB for the next few games,"I really, really enjoyed that game.  Very professional.","I didn‚Äôt think this game was all that terrible. Generally defended well in the final third and Hugo did his job to keep us in it. Definitely some scary chances conceded though.

I can‚Äôt help but think not re-signing Eriksen was a massive mistake. He would be exactly what we needed in midfield right now. And he would have gotten plenty of game time.","I'm just glad Sonny got his goals and his smile again. He just completely changed the complexion of this match from us looking shaky and maybe coming away with an unsatisfying victory, to being able to go into the international break with a dominant win.",We did a lot better than the scoreline shows tbh.

I stopped watching at the 70th minute. I‚Äôve never abandoned a match in any sport before.,,"I am sure there will still be defenders of him, when 4 out of 5 games he is so laughably bad offensively that any moderate defender would blow him out of the water, but now that Emerson Royal also loses you games defensively, and turns the ball over more than anyone else in the team, can we stop giving him chances.  Just stop. He is a walking disappointment on offense and defense. Djed Spence, Perisic, Doherty. Any and all are better options. And yes I know he is more physical than those three, good lord does that not outweigh the negatives.","Richarlison on the right doesn't work, especially if Emerson plays because there is zero creativity on that side. We need prime Doherty back ASAP.",I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not going to stop wearing my Romero jersey now. We‚Äôre 8-1-0 when I wear it.,Brilliant result. The football‚Ä¶less brilliant.,"Weren't great defensively today imo which was always going to happen when we played Perisic on his opposite side paired with Davinson who, as much as I love him, always has a mistake in his locker at any given moment. 

We failed to play out of the backline a lot in the first half and a bit of the second half but Bissouma coming on was an absolute game-changer. Kind of convinced that's the answer to games where we are getting pressed so high. He had quite a good cameo today and changed our game. 

Son. What a footballing fairytale. Golden boot winner fails to fire at the start of the season, gets benched, and scores the first PL hattrick from the bench in 7 years. Can't write it.

Bentancur! Thought he was fairly shaky in the first half but absolutely bossed it when he came out in that second half. So happy he got his first for the club, he's deserved it. Shout-out to Pierre as well, he was really playing with some flair and swagger that I haven't seen from him before!

Overall I'm happy and the improvement continues. Onto the next one.","Despite all of the negative comments, that was not the worst thing that could have happened in a hostile away game. 

Still second in the league and only 2 points away for Sporting. 

I'm alright with a draw.

We went into a hostile environment and arguably could have won 3-1.","They are right to be mad, we absolutely robbed them and this is 100% the game I would pick to do that in.

Son and the red card he was able to draw out was massive for us. We weren't doing well before that challenge. Game changing... then the sweet brace by Richarlison. What a start to our European competition!,My god... Our YouTube highlight video's comments is just 99% about Son. Whether he's good or bad everyone has to mention him lmao.,"The thing about Sonny, I know he didn't have his best game again, but I could see he was getting better bit by bit. I know he's having a very slow start to finding his game, languid at times, but I know Sonny will find his form. His corner was perfect to execution which led to an amazing set piece goal, creds to VIO. I know Richarlison has better defense pressing and understanding, especially when he has less tiredness on the pitch at later times, and that he should be given his time seeing how great he was at driving forward. But I firmly believe Sonny when he scores his field goal will soar and fly again. He had a great shot on goal that hit Jose Sa and post, this the type of shooting that will have Sonny the MVP he was last season. I fully believe in him to be leading Spurs' attack when he defeats this period of slump. That's the thing about Sonny, he always comes back in flying colors after a period of 'slump'. He has shown that again and again and he's proven himself to be a resolute person he is. His on the ball, first touch was off, but this will get better and better as season goes on. I believe this because I am a Spurs fan and I believe in our players.",richarlison man of the match for me

Spend so much on the players that we allegedly wanted, bring in a world class manager who has practically never failed to bring glory to any club he's been at, yet we're getting embarrased by Arsenal with Mikel fucking Arteta at the helm.

I'd say it's beyond belief, but is it really? Is it not just a case of us doing the exact same thing, making the exact same mistakes, every single season?

I just can't see how anything could come close to changing the fact that we're a trophy-less embarrassment.","Even though we were robbed, you can‚Äôt hide the fact of how shit we were; probably till about Gill coming on",Honetsly I don‚Äôt get the issue with this team? We have class players a class manager yet any big games we just.. ghost like nothing ever falls perfectly into place,,Good to see Messi in white,"Iffy call on the red, but Royal put the decision in Taylor's hands with an awful challenge.

Conte's system fucking sucks.,Fuck Lurch. Fuck Chelsea. COME ON YOU SPURS!!!!,"Kane shit, Son shit, Richarlison + Kulu alright, would be nice to have another attacker for situations like these instead of multiple wingbacks who are still behind Emerson for some reason.","A lot of that performance has to fall on Conte. By the final 5 minutes plus stoppages they had half their side with fresh legs and 9/10 of our outfield players had put a full game in with everyone but Bissouma having put in a start at the weekend. And it really truly showed.

The subs are on the bench. Make the subs. The tactics were not yielding results. Adjust the tactics. There were plenty of lacklustre performances out there to improve on.

Nonetheless, another point from a game we lost last season. So we roll on, COYS.",Love Sonny of course but I think Richarlison-Kane-Kulusevski has to be the front 3 for Saturday.,"Thought PEH bossed it.

Lenglet showed some promise, didn't blow me out the water but it's only his first game for us.

What a win,Obviously I'm happy but also confused that somehow we are in top 4 ha,"The predictability of our midfield turnovers is maddening. Whether it‚Äôs 4-2 or 3-2, we‚Äôre always outnumbered there.",Get Conte out and get a manager that commits long term,First half mistakes. Painful rebuild once again,"I think Tottenham's problem is the same thing every single year, which is that we have a poor squad due to poor transfers.

At the moment, Kulusevski is the glue that holds the team together, just like Eriksen was a few years ago. When Kulusevski plays, we play so much better as a team. It's the same to an extent with Bentancur. These two guys were seriously good transfers that we need to be making each window in order to compete with the top teams. We absolutely cannot make any more transfers like Gil, NDombele, Lo Celso, Emerson, Sarr, Clarke, or Rodon. All of these people were dubious transfers who have had no real impact on the overall quality of the squad.

Given this fact, I find it hard to pin our current issues on Conte given how poor our squad is: Bissouma, Hojbjerg, and Gil are not players who are going to test the opposition's back line, leaving Kane and Son to try and do it all on their own again. On the other hand, how has Emery completely outclassed Conte with an Aston Villa squad which hasn't made any transfers since he joined? It doesn't put Conte in a good light.

The club needs to find out if Conte is intent on signing a new deal now, so that they can make smart transfers in the summer. If he is still wavering in a couple of months, then I believe it would be better to cut and run and find a new manager, so that the new transfers fit his style.

I still find it ludicrous that people are pinning the teams' current issues on Conte, as if the club has done everything for him and he hasn't given anything in return. The truth is that the club has still done very little for him and Conte has given us champions league football in return. He is absolutely justified in asking for more time. Furthermore, Tottenham have never hired a manager of his calibre before, and the club should do everything they can to keep him, and not risk everything by hiring a inexperienced manager who promotes youth or whatever. This would be another dodgy transfer to add to the list.","Controlled in the second half, Fulham never looked like scoring.",It's promising signs to see us breaking down a proper low block using width and tight link up play in and outside the edge of the box. Lovely stuff,"bryan gil looks like he got plucked out of the 70s, i love watching him fly around the pitch","We _might_ still get a decent fee for Sanchez , he'd fit nicely at West Ham.

Wish Richy stayed instead of Kane,"Lost the game from the start by playing into their hands. We do the same thing every year and we come away with the same result. You've got to go there and kill the atmosphere and their motivation, not encourage it.

On the brightside they needed our most important player out of the game, a lucky goal and for us to self-destruct to win. The frustrating thing is the point was there for the taking and we shot ourselves in the foot as usual.","Played gorgeous football today, and all noticeably so much better when bissouma came on for a 3-5-2","Big 3 points. Deserved.

352 worked a treat thanks to the fullbacks. Sessegnon excellent. Doherty very good given it's his first real minutes. Could have had an assist in the opening minutes if he was sharper.","Curious to see if we trot out a 5-3-2 after the break. Drop Deki to CAM and rotate Kane/Son/Richy as the front 3. Kane and Son are just si deadly as a strike partnership, and we've looked much more fluid when Bissouma has come on to switch to a midfield 3.

Also, Son will deservedly steal the headlines for his hat-trick, but Bentancur was outstanding today. Kulusevski, Sessegnon, and H√∏jbjerg with solid performances as well.",I‚Äôm convinced Son does not play well in 3-4-3 when Perisic plays.,Anyone remember timmy running past our bench after their second goal like he won the CL oh he's an angry little german isnt he,"Wow, that was an unexpected and terrible performance. Everyone looked lackadaisical and a step behind. Harry and Son need rotations immediately. Emerson needs to be dropped. Cuti seems like he needs a bit more fitness after returning from injury. PEH and Benta were puzzling. When Richy is off, he's frustrating to watch, like today",That was a really hard watch. First time being genuinely disappointed in Conte‚Ä¶how did we only make one sub in that awful 2nd half?!!,Good result and a decent performance in 2nd half. But wtf was that red doing? Did he feel bad for giving a red so he went easy on them for the rest of the game?

They narrowly escaped against Wrexham in their 1st game and then almost bottled it in the replay match but still piss all over us...

I'm quickly starting to understand why Conte doesn't make many or any substitutions at times. Clearly because he can't trust any of them.. If we take out Kulusevski and Kane, this attack and the whole team is basically dead. Lucas runs around, Richarilson offers absolutely nothing and poor Son is forced to take a shot each time he gets the ball because there's nothing else to do.. and in top of that I'm already starting to hate Perisic as well, cause he is occupying the space that should be Son's and 75% of times makes a shitty cross/decision in general. 

..and to think that apparently Sheffield also played mostly their B-side, f\*\*\* me (don't follow them, but saw such comment).",Excuse me‚Ä¶.Chelsea are shit.,"Richarlison should start every game. He keeps solid control of the ball, exhausts the defense, and as we saw from the world cup has the talent to score.

1. This fixture is destined to have at least 6 goals doesn't it.
2. Son you absolute beauty.
3. I think today also pretty much gave us our best backline - Romero, Dier and Lenglet.
4. The right hand side consisting of Sanchez who is bad with the ball and Perisic who was wrong footed created all the problems. Perisic at RWB might work, but not with Sanchez.
5. I don't think even Madison has any idea about how his shot ended into the goal.
6. 3-5-2 might work, but it would make us very counter attacking. Probably against the like of City, or if we get deep into the CL, we would be better with a 3-5-2.
7. The improvements in attacking set pieces are really evident. These set pieces could get us about 5-7 points by themselves.
8. Also, what the hell are we going to do without Hugo. I am too afraid to even think about it properly.","

We need to stop overpaying for managers when they deliver this awful caliber of results",Son needs to be dropped as does Lloris,"We conceded at least two goals per match in the last seven league games. Seven. Blame the system or the defense, but blaming our attackers (especially Son) for the losses is harsh. In fact, we scored the third most goals before Christmas.

We need to keep adding top quality options like Deki in the winter, or expect e.g. Perisic returning to last year's form, to lift the level of the squad.

Also it's a little bizarre that although the team run around a lot, they don't seem in top physical shape. Can't win one on one duels and easily dominated by more aggressive opponents.

To have all the players we want to match our aspirations would cost us ¬£300-500m to put on the squad, plus another another ¬£200-250M in wages over 5 years.

In my opinion, to fill out a proper squad:

We need a new GK sooner than later.

We need 2-3 new CBs, some mix of starting and depth.

We need 2 more attacking players of quality, either depth or for the future.

We need a new left and right wing back, or if we switch to a back four we need two creative mids to flesh out the squad and a new LB (or recall Reguilon) and RB of depth.","Royal and Lloris both had good games tonight, makes the win even more pleasing",More revisionism.

First of all Spurs were quite poor for the whole game, very lucky to come away with a point. The midfield was completely overrun, the team looked poor in possession and didn't really create too much.

Things to be very optimistic about are the fact we came back twice, our subs were fantastic Richarlison, Perisc and Bissouma all made their presence felt, was very impressed with Richarlison's work rate and Perisc's corner for Kane's goal was superb.

\- Emerson did well. Scored obviously but he also kept Grealish from doing much of anything. 

\- Bentancur made a difference. He is just so great at receiving the ball and turning.

\- Kulusevski looked solid. Not quite full throttle yet but looked better than last game and offers a lot going forward.","A supposed benefit of playing 3 cbs is to

 a) Have wingbacks that can afford to attack more

b) Being able to push out of line as a cb to press a player

c) Having that sort of ""sweeper"" as the central cb to shore up the defence.

We're playing 3cbs, losing midfield battles all the time (being outnumbered, I believe that our midfielders are doing just fine job playing in disadvantage. On top of that, our only wingback that has decent numbers seems to be interfering with Son, who's had pretty much 1 good half this season (but seems to be playing always anyway), and Dier as a CCB seems to be exact opposite of that stability he's supposed to offer

**We're a mess right now.**","I‚Äôm gonna get downvoted here; But I‚Äôm still not ready to give up on Conte.

He‚Äôs done a really good job for us so far, and we probably would be further down the table if we had a worse manager. 

On one hand, The current performances are not acceptable for sure, but our squad depth is still seriously lacking. Not only in the back, but the middle, especially now that Bentacur is injured. You can‚Äôt blame all performances on squad, but I don‚Äôt think we can blame all performances on Conte either.

On the other hand, Conte has some issues. If he wants the club to invest, he needs to project more long term confidence. He needs to get Son and Kane into shape, because they have been playing awful.

No hunger, no passion, no intensity, toothless and just confusing! I don't blame Conte and never have thus far, it's Joe Lewis,Levy refusing to pay to play but at the momentum it's those players on the pitch.
No one shows that they really want it, poor mentality. Almost as if we underestimate our opposition and don't care. I wouldn't be surprised if Conte dropped most of the starting 11 going forward. Too much complacency and no care.
At this rate we won't make top 4, won't make it far in Europe and forget any cup silverware. How many goals have Son and Kane scored in finals since 2015? Lloris must be on the sauce again and our defence look like yhey are playing a completely different sport at times.

Perisic and Bentancur. Obviously not perfect but their work rate and overall contribution was top.

I feel like everyone else was just okay or performed just under where they should be performing (exception for Richie as he only got 15 minutes in).

All in all, 3 points... that's all that matters. COYS!","This confirms that Perisic's playstyle is cannibalistic with Son's.

Getting Lloris, Romero, and Bentancur back for next game will be nice.","I get the rhetoric about him not being physically big or strong, but it‚Äôs not the be all end all. He‚Äôs only 21 and will naturally get stronger as his body matures. 

It‚Äôs much easier to build strength than it is to build technical ability and even levels of stamina.

Maybe he‚Äôll spend most of the first half being barged off the ball, but the defenders won‚Äôt be able to keep doing that in the 70th minute when he‚Äôll be able to run rings round them.",Thank God it was a gooner on the end of that last second header or we'd be out lmaoooo,We are a social experiment into how high of rates of cardiovascular disease we‚Äôll have at the end of the season.,It‚Äôs exhausting watching these clowns.,,"Sick of waiting until we‚Äôre down to actually give a shit.

Glad Kulusevski is back, we need him desperately.",Ventroni won us that game today. We had the fitness to fight til the last minutes. Good comeback win but shouldn‚Äôt be in that position in the first place,"Perisic is either not understanding or choosing not to play to the game plan. Never in sync out there. Always in the wrong place in defense, disjointed on offense. Added nothing at all as a sub.

It's frustrating that other clubs have figured out a simple press will put the backline under enough pressure to force turnovers. Then when the ball is won back, it's almost NEVER player into feet for a counter. Either out or to absolutely nobody. 

Not sure why that diagonal ball thru the center mids is also some kind of off-limits pass as well. Either they're completely oblivious to it being on or they've been instructed to never play it. Saw it multiple times today and it would've sprung sess or Emerson, but instead it was chopped back to Dier who heaved it up to have it lost or to Sanchez who couldn't control or keep the ball in front of himself at all the entire match.","Despite the canceled goal, there were 2-3 goal opportunities that the team should have capitalized on.",üëè Conte's destroying this team because he wants to include his old dying friend Perisic in his team üëè Bye-bye counter attacking FC üëè Welcome backpass FC üëè,,"Honestly a pretty bad performance, we played pathetically after the red card and Frankfurt could‚Äôve easily taken points.

We go again though, still time to turn this around and we can clearly go up at least two gears.. Just hope we are not still waiting for that to happen in 3 months time.","What I wanna know is when we'll see Doherto Carlos back in action. Emerson wasn't terrible today but it felt like the team didn't wanna give him the ball even when he was in space.

Would be nice to see us balance attacks with wingbacks down both flanks. Today felt like it was just Perisic on the left and Deki on the right (personally thought they were two of our best players today). Need both the wingers and wingbacks firing to really make the most of this system",Perhaps its time to entertain the idea of a front 4. Our attack looked absolutely awful until kulu came on,The fucking pace on Spence. Think he'll be starting by season's end.,I want to kiss Kane on the mouth,"Frustrating in a sense because that really should have been a much more comfortable win. Leno made some good saves, we hit the woodwork twice, and a goal ruled out by pretty fine margins (rightly so but still). Then Fulham had almost no chances: the one Mitrovic buried which was awful defending but the only other two I can think of were serious deflections. 

Felt like we dominated in most parts of the pitch and everyone played well but things just weren't quite going the way we needed them to.

Toothless in the final third. We still have some rust but are getting results. Happy with the day","Maybe in future when we play teams who employ a 3-5-2, we should match them. The extra man in the middle of the park did well to nullify our build up until we had to rely on fitness to win. 

A creative midfielder playing ahead of the double pivot could have worked wonders and even Bissouma could probably have done the job well. Sure we‚Äôd lose an attacking piece but it makes the bench even more potent should we need to switch it up in the second half. Maybe once Skipps back and/or we bring in this coveted creative mid it will happen. There are 9 other teams who employ a back 3 at least semi regularly and only Everton play two in the middle like us.","Great performance across the board, just some disappointing finishing/bad luck with VAR.

Hate to say it but this team as it is built currently is just not going to be successful.",Don't actually feel too bad about this result. Looked really solid for the first 50' of the game. Conte's game plan was going well. Lloris and the backline cost us the game. Son continuing to be anonymous once again.,"I didn't expect anything when I woke up this morning, but that was infinitely worse than I would have imagined.","I've come to the conclusion that Kane cares about 1 thing more than anything else...his pursuit of the all-time EPL goal record.  He'd rather score 13 goals at the midway point with his team's offense floundering than drop into the false 9 ever again.  Why is he at the point of the spear vs a high line when he can't outrun anybody?  His ego will never allow him to be on a team where another player shines above him like Son did last year.  He'd rather take every direct kick than let anyone else take them because if there is a chance he can get a goal, he wants it.  Of course he is the only one scoring right now because he's the only one getting the ball passed to him...I'm looking at you Perisic.  You can do something else than cross the ball to Kane.

\- Everton aren't good, and didn't come for a win, a lot of that game was like watching a training game

\- PEH & Bentacur good again

\- Doherty has a decent game, nothing special (the overreaction here is hilarious)

\- Best game for Bissouma so far for us, hopefully settles in a little more and we see the player we know.

\- Ref was awful again and clearly there was an intention from Everton to leave a little afters on us in an attempt to break up the game.",Bissouma made 2x last second tackles to stop goals. Doherty made one too. Solid professional performance across team. I do hope we only roll out 5-3-1 only against the harder teams.,# I desperately need Conte Cam,You can't blame Conte if we are one mishit pass away from a goal every 5 minutes.

Conte is a top top coach for sure 

We are no longer a Kane-Son team

The decisions, end product, passings and overall level is just so low.","The way I saw it was that we started pressing for the first couple of seconds (maybe first couple of minutes) and then the defense drops way too deep after they get their first chance which creates a big gap between the midfield and the defense which leads to more chances and then the midfield has to drop back to fill that gap.   


Along with that, any player that didn't have the ball seemed to have their feet glued to the ground and decided that they weren't allowed to move until the ball came their way.

Sess as LWB has better link up with Son and even scored today and Perisic has played before as right wing, being both-footed. I'd choose Perisic over Doherty (and royal I don't even want to mention this abomination) because his crosses are game changing and his corners are important. Richarlison can play any position of the 3 forwards and Gil provides energy as a sub. I don't want to see Moura after the winter. Skipp is Hoj's sub and Bent right now is undroppable. Bissouma is lacking all the quality he's shown at Brighton.",Horrendous back line,Gil needs to play more.  He makes shit happen.,"Pretty clear before the first 30 minutes were up that Perisic, Bentancur, Bissouma, Davies and Dier were actively hurting Spurs yet Conte didn‚Äôt make a single change until after the 80th minute.

1. The commentators (on Amazon) were more clueless than half the people on this sub. 

2. No matter how tired Harry Kane is - he is pure world class. Feeds off next to nothing, yet still scored and almost wins us the game. And should have had a penalty. 

3. People need to start accepting Son is responsible for his poor form this season, not Conte and not Perisic. 

4. Forster has metal hips and knees and they look like they are rusty. He was stiff AF.

5. That was a stone wall penalty. The defender couldn't possibly have been playing the ball - he had his back to it. 

6. Moment of the game was the Brentford supporters chanting ""cheat, cheat, cheat"" one minute before their player got booked for diving. He must have thought they were instructions being shouted at him. 

7. Tangana and Dier are relegation fighting quality. Although that might be pushing it in tanganga's case. A hungover Romero would have been a better option today. 

8. Bisouma could be a competent third option, but massively overhyped when we signed him. He way behind Hojbjerg and Bentancur.","I wouldn‚Äôt say decision making as much as lack of skill.

I think we have found the answer","Great result. Glad to see Son back amongst the goals and Conte change the game with subs earlier on. But that first half was bizarre. Defence and Midfield looked well off the pace, miss-placed passes and bad tackles. Sanchez obviously poor but I though Perisic was bad in open play on the right (great dead balls though)

Bentancur's goal so important rectifying the errors of the first half.",We need to put Kane and Son together in a room giving passes to each other till next game and see if like that they can find each other on the field ffs,Conte has turned this club into relentless murder hobos and I love it.,I need Doherty back in my life.,"Considering how we played, a point is a decent result. Conte should have made more subs, and earlier. Yes Skipp has only just returned from injury, but Hojbjerg was struggling. If Skipp wasn't ready then put Sarr in there.

Lloris will never learn when to just put his boot through it, the amount of goals we've conceded from his poor kicking is very frustrating. We're the cause of our downfall when it comes to conceding goals.

Bentancur was by far our best players, and even though we were poor before he went off, the wheels absolutely came off at that point.

I'm really tired of being frustrated by the same things:
-Son trying to score his Burnley goal every time he gets the ball. Why make the simple pass and retain possession, when you can try to dribble past their whole team and lose the ball?
-H√∏jbjerg and Bentancur putting in absolute shifts in the midfield only to be let down by constant turnovers from our front 3 and defensive lapses.
-Being tactically dominated. Even towards the end of the Poch era, where we were really struggling to break teams down and score goals, we were still controlling games. The results weren't there, but we still weren't being tactically played off the pitch. The brutal loss to Bayern stands out because it was such an anomaly. Under Mourinho we slowly started to concede control of games, and it was horrible to watch. It continued under Nuno. Conte seemed to cure us of that last season, but we've been played off the pitch tactically more this season than I can recall since top 6 games under AVB.
-Conte's stubbornness to adapt his tactics. Leicester were killing us all game by playing a false 9, sucking Dier forward, and exploiting the space behind him. Faes and Mendy completely marked Kane and Kulusevski out of the game, and forced our build-up play to go through Son playing with his back to goal, which he has been horrendous at all season (always been a weakness of his, but it's been particularly glaring this season). This game was screaming for a switch to a back 4 and 2 strikers. Push Perisic up to LM and Son to LS in a 4-4-2 at halftime and we might claw back into it before Bentancur gets hurt.","Every transfer window, the news are always about how the club is going to fix the big problems in the squad in the next window.

1- Some new signings 

2- city to go and overtake arsenal","Every coach we‚Äôve had these past 5‚Äôish years has had their list of mistakes. 

Since I‚Äôm not super familiar with Conte‚Äôs ‚Äúgame‚Äù, it blows my mind that out of every player on our team, the focal point is always Sessegnon. Second half it was like someone reminded the team that Kulu exists and it really transformed our style immediately.

Lastly, we have to really analyze if its even worth playing a front 3 if they all get squeezed against the backline and end up being traffic cones for brilliant crosses from our star studded fullbacks on most games.
Like what even is the point of starting son if that wing gets occupied almost entirely by whatever fullback is playing that game and he just stands there for 90 mins..

But what do I know ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","I keep seeing Conte out messages. I'm not even sure what to think of because on one hand, it's the same core of players that broke Poch and Jose, so even if we bring another manager in, at some point the usual suspects will keep fucking it up. You cannot always have good performances and that is when individual quality must shine through and pull us through. Individual quality which seldom can be found in our players unfortunately.

On the other hand though, I am completely amazed that Conte still shoehorns the few not completely shit players into a system which just does not work at all. We've had a ""pre-season"" to prepare the players and somehow we turn out even worse, and that is followed by a 2 month spell of average performances themselves where Kane and Benta bailed us out. Granted, we have had a few notable absences and our game should look a little better with Kulusevski and Bentancur back in the starting XI, but then what the fuck was the point of Summer's transfer window where we were supposed to improve our bench? Perisic and Bissouma just look uninspiring if you ask me; Spence barely makes an appearence and while Richy is out with an injury I have to say he's just a backup to Kane.

In any case, I would rather stick with the manager. Conte's last major success was after all just 1.5 years ago, he's not a washed up dinosaur like Jose was, and still has a better track record than Poch. We also have to bring in upgrades on key positions especially in the CB position where we still rely on Davies and Lenglet himself is just a good passer but otherwise an average defender. And don't get me started on Hugo, guy is just not a captain material and is extremely error prone. He was a great keeper but his time is up, shame he deserved a trophy but it is what it is.

Finally, I just want to point out our dear Gooners who are running away with the league: well, if the management followed the reactionary crowd and sacked the manager, they would probably still be in mid table mediocrity. Instead - they backed the manager, brought him the players he wanted and yes it was a painful process (far more painful than ours lets be honest, we are terribly uninspiring but they were relegation material just a year ago if you remember) but now it clearly is paying off. I say we should attempt the same and continue this project.

So, a quick TL:DR: I think Conte is still our best shot at trying to make something happen. Sacking him will maybe improve things on the short term but if we keep the same airheads which let down the previous managers things will not change long term. I think the players are a bigger issue and we should strive to replace the underperforming ones with better and more ambitious ones. That is also the only way we can instill a winning culture, most of these players look so jaded when they play.",Is this what winning feels like?,95% a waste of space.

Fulham's defense looked turned inside out every time we were in their 1/3.  Front four looked great, Son looked MUCH better and Richarlison really made the most of out of his start, good god.  Sess had an solid game, that Kane goal was him giving a 110%.  Also if Lenglet is supposed to be a ""stopgap"" then he's a welding torch.

There's still issues with finishing. Some of it can be chalked up to bad luck, but it's also about sharpness... 23 shots should definitely produce more than two goals, and Son and Richy should really be on the sheet.  It's like we figured out how to work together in pressure, but were a half a beat off when actually taking the shots.  Also, that Fulham goal was a defensive brain fart (and also a total banger from Mitrovic, credit due)... gotta keep the concentration in the late game.  Unfortunate, because the defense was looking good for most of the match.

So encouraging signs for the development of this tactical system.  Still a lot of work ahead.  Good three points."

Skipp also not match fit , yves was ok     
Sessognon for the love of all that is spurs , this fucking guy right here is a conundrum: a confidence player , total fucking trash today every single decision on the ball was poor , but drop him and he warps into a shell of himself    
Perisic also trying to avoid injury , didn‚Äôt commit fully this game whatevs    
Sanchez ‚Ä¶ only play in case of emergency, has zero positional awareness, terrible next to Dier , maybe Tanganga would be better option if not Romero , but we will have no fucking idea because the league cup was where you hope to bring players / formations in , now that‚Äôs gone   
Spence , that guy has speed and some skill , should easily be given more opportunity especially when we need to generate offence

Will be good to force him to rotate I assume our first choice might be perisic on the right and sess on the left. But I will like seeing Doherty see if he can get match fit again he was playing great last year pre injury. 

I think this has to make Conte try a 3-5-2 more often we were overrun again in the midfield even with Bentacur playing great with deke hurt have Richarlson be a super sub and with the congestion till the World Cup the rotation will be needed. Hopefully Skip can get some minutes and we can get back to 4 fit mids.

They allowed Conte more tactical flexibility (Richarlison and Lucas to increase the attacking presence) and they refreshed the XI on the pitch to allow the team to play the whole match at a high level (Peresic and Bissouma) while Chelsea was dropping off by the end.,"Seen this scenario so many times. I had my stream muted when they had a freekick in the 85th minute then had muted again for the corner cuz the fucking screaming of the crowd was gonna piss me off even more.
My point is these games followed every expected pattern and ended up with the exact same result.

You'll need two hands to count the number of times this exact scenario has happened. Have these men no shame?

The predictability is horrifying.

People are saying this is a wakeup call, I beg to differ, these guys ain't waking up from anything. Our performances have been horrible this season with favourable results.

There is no change for this club from the previous seasons. We're stuck in limbo.","Why is everyone harping on the ‚Äúpoints we didn‚Äôt get last season‚Äù thing, like we‚Äôre not going to drop other points throughout the season?

146,"&#x200B;

Conte's system can't be gone soon enough for me.  

The left side of Son & Perisic is useless. Sonny is not strong on the ball and virtually useless in the air. Sonny can't do anything when receiving the ball as a target because he is easily displaced from the ball.   He needs to run onto the ball with forward momentum like on the counter. This system does not engender counters except against the top attacking clubs.  

When Son & Perisc play together, Perisic squeezes Son by overlapping out wide.  At this point, we face the specter of meaningless crosses from Perisic and Son is erased.  Sonny can't do anything when receiving the ball as a target because he is easily displaced from the ball.   He needs to run onto the ball with forward momentum like on the counter. This system does not engender that except against the top attacking clubs.  So we play with Sonny in limited space often receiving the ball with his back to the goal. Teams just crowd the box, doubling Kane.  We should not even try the left side ( I know that is an absurd statement).  

Should the ball get to the middle of the field near the box on the left,  we have no creative middle-of-the-field play because our 2 mids are often battling 3 mids and Son has been erased.  If my dumb ass can see this.....WTF can't people who spend lifetimes on the game?","We are not going to win a cup title until we do a complete retooling of the teams culture and focus.

We are victims of our own rise up the table. It used to be that the league was focused on getting into Europe. And the cups were our serious push for trophies. But over the past decade with us becoming top four regulars the focus has shifted to trying to compete for the league (badly), and cups have been thrown to the wayside. Poch even said as much. Cups were just ""ego stroking"" and it was the CL and league that mattered.

We now have a generation of players and staff within the club raised on that mentality. And that includes our talisman players.

Style of play won't matter, manager won't matter. If our mentality is that cups don't matter then we won't win a cup unless we get thrown to the literal wolves and have to go through Chelsea, United and Arsenal on the way.

This may end up unpopular. But we could probably have a better shot at breaking the trophy drought if we decided to ""give up"" competing for the league title and going back to having European qualification as our focus in the league. And retooling back into being a cup team. Because right now we don't have it in us to play knockout football unless we are massive underdogs for some reason. Or we manage to score decently early.","Ben or Skip for MOTM for me. Skip probably should get it for the golazo, but Big Ben was everywhere",Who was the lad wearing Emerson‚Äôs jersey today? Bloody proud of him today. He needed that.  COYS!,If I could trade I would have rather lost to City,I hate to say it but Lloris is done at this level. He needs to be dropped for the next game. No way can you expect to win when his confidence is this low. Son needs dropping too. What have we got to lose?,"If Conte has decided to change things up this season with Kane being the target man instead of dropping deep to be the creator  like last season, why does he insist on playing Son for the whole 90 mins?? It's obvious that Son isn't the Number 10 on the left that Kulu is on the right.

I honestly thought Richarlison was coming on for Son. Was really taken aback when Doherty came off.

I want to see us playing football in and up to the final third. Rather than all these Hail Mary hopefuls. It looks like we really start to panic to be honest. There‚Äôs no composure and there‚Äôs no joined up thinking.

Emerson cannot start the next game. 

We need to start the first half with determination.","Poor game from the back forward, but a few key players who were just actively bad. 

* Sanchez's lack of passing was utterly exposed here.  With Romero in the side we are dramatically better over all.
* Bissouma had an absolute shocker.  Fun to watch at times but generally provided very little and left the (now injured) Hojbjerg to carry our midfield.  
* Son was bad again.  He's by far the least of these issues, and would have had a goal if not for Kehrer's OG, but he left Perisic stranded down the left.
* The ref was genuinely appalling, I felt like I was back in that first season of VAR where it felt like the refs were actively sabotaging the technology.  Four and a half fucking minutes to make a simple handball call that I am never getting back.  Also made that classic refereeing blunder of thinking that a lot of yellow cards will calm a game down when in fact it has the exact opposite effect.","2-0  but was a real fucking struggle at home, against 10 men for a half, hard to take much confidence from this","Very mixed feelings.

That isn‚Äôt squad depth, these are players that NEED to go straight into the first team. If we take Levy at face value about competing and winning, then I‚Äôm sorry but players like Hojbjerg and Son have to be phased out for younger and better. 

Two CB‚Äôs have to come in regardless if Conte stays, the sheer malpractice of this is disgraceful. Mourinho wanted Skriniar in 2020, and had to settle for Rodon. Romero cancels out losing Toby and Jan. 

Then a GK has to be next. Raya, Sanchez, Pickford fucking whoever they choose HAS to been in before pre-season.

The players brought in to make the next step were so bad that we're paying them to play football in a different country. A shambles and very sad to see.

Also I just don‚Äôt believe Sessegnon will ever reach the heights people think he is capable of as much as I like the guy, his passing in the final third and decision making has been bad all season","oh yes, UCL is back for spurs.

I seriously can't fucking do this.",We haven't had creativity since we sold the man who was playing against us tonight. I'm tired of the reasons for defeat always being the same.

While the depth got better this season, it's still far from perfect.

While I absolutely love Son, I honestly think Richarlison should start next week, at least one game. Son deserves the trust no question, but some competition can't hurt.",Richarlison had space to score because Marseille had one less player. Seriously guys Sonny played poorly but doesn't change the fact that his red card-inducing sprint was the game changer today. And he's like the only player in the team who can pull that off. There's a reason Conte keeps him in the starting lineup.,"I think we need to do better with the ball, and sometimes give up too much possession in the middle, but some people need to understand, that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre set up. 
We are set up to attack from wide positions, which is at the detriment to the middle of the park. But it‚Äôs intentional from Conte, nothing to do with him not understanding what‚Äôs going on, which some in the match thread were suggesting. Unless we had 13 players, you have to give up areas of the pitch, to get advantages in others.","Few takeaways for me

1. Very glad big Dave has stayed at the club in his current role. Solid defensively today.
2. Peresic does everything insanely well. Guy is absolute class.
3. Richarlson has impact the second he is subbed on every game. Absolutely love the man! Instant energy.","PEH with an incredible performance . Man destroyed, created and scored !"

Romero played a hell of a game but Skipp dominated that midfield with PEH on top of scoring a goal.,Substitute Son on every game lmao,"Let me get this straight. Today after getting the first goal, we had, 

1. Mendy scoring only his second goal in 7 years for Leicester, which was a wondergoal.
2. Faes's tackle somehow lands directly into the strikers legs.
3. Our best player today goes of injured while crying from pain.
4. After being dreadful for months, Milan finally win a match before they have to face us.

Really happy for Sonny,First game away after World Cup break and missing several players ends with a draw I'll take it.  In past seasons we don't come away with any points in a game like this.,I'd say solid defensive performance but poor attack.

But that kind of performance with that strong of a squad out there, it just feels pointless. 

Kane, Perisic, Hojbjerg, and Bentancur shouldn‚Äôt have played at all today in my opinion. We better make some moves in January if Conte feels that way about some of our young guys.",,"Wtf are we sooo bad in first half, we know we can do better, pinned down Liverpool, could have actually won if we were little lucky. Even 50% of 2nd half performance would have got us atleast a draw.

And can we just have Doherty starting now. Man did much more than Emerson.","The second half today and on Wednesday shows we have good enough players to play decent football (obviously some still need to be moved on). A lot of the blame has to lie with Conte at the moment I think. Poor team selection and mismanagement of the first half of games needs to change. I think this is on Conte and he needs to start doing better. 

I do not want to hear him moaning about the players again before he gets his own camp in order. The level of negativity and blame which he places outside of himself whenever we lose is so tiring to listen to, I wish he'd take more responsibility. 

The next week will be very important in determining our immediate future with Conte I think. 

And finally, Bentancur is the fucking man. Unbenchable at the moment.","Wonder what drivel we'll hear in the post match interview today....

- Harry has also been trash but a stoppage time equalizer helps heal wounds.

- Really wish Lenglet was available today.  Davies wasn't great and in general we desperately needed help over the top and Dier and Davies weren't up to the task.

-  Conte needs to make his subs earlier and Bissouma needs more minutes.  Hung out too long in the back four and it cost us with their second goal.

- I was all onboard with Sess getting the start, he earned it after last week, but Perisic needs to slide into that role ASAP.  He's just better and having him for free kicks over Son produces is a massive plus.

No question that if AT had shown a yellow, VAR would not have intervened. After that the game was over.

The home team normally wins the NLD so we went in as underdogs. I'm not as bothered about the scoreline as I am about the manner of the defeat.

1. No yellows in the game until Anthony Taylor (AT)goes rogue for the straight red. √òdegaard pulls a textbook yellow (and the advantage is given) but no card after that.
2. Classic AT then books two players from Arsenal for pretty innocuous fouls. Not Gabriel Jesus of course because he's on 4 yellows and the 5th would be a suspension against Liverpool.

A couple of considerations:
1. Why do we never get Michael Oliver as a ref? We had him once last year (I think against Liverpool) but he always works in Manchester/Merseyside. Best referee in the league.
2. Why aren't we making a bigger deal about this. I would be happy for Conte to go full Thomas Tuchel on this and take the suspension and fine but put out in the media that AT blew it. It was a shitty decision and it impacted the rest of the game.
3. If I was in charge of THFC I would hire a statistician to literally spend all their time on the ref and then come up with factual correlations (which do not equal causation) about the referee every single time. Make it a ref problem. Get under their skin. Fergie was a master of this but he didn't have stats back him.

Obviously we have Bissouma, but I don‚Äôt think Conte wants to play him, Hoj and Benta all at once cos it‚Äôs too defensive

In the first half, he was playing on the right, was able to do his thing, and that created a lot of chances for us. In the second half, he somehow went back to playing in the left & center and it was all downhill from there. Perisic started to overlap in routes with Son + Son started receiving the ball too deep in the field, by the time he got to the final third he was visibly too gassed to make any moves.   


IMHO I think we would play the best when Kane plays the CAM role and we have Son, Richarlison, and Kulu up top. No disrespect to Kane - he is obviously amazing in front of the goal, but without him, we cannot get the ball safely to the final third. We have enough great scorers but not enough creative passers. The question lies in whether Kane would even want to play that role...  seems to me he wants to score above everything else. Ironically, I think him playing the CAM role will open more chances for him to score, because we are coming up with so little chances with how things are going right now","United fan here.

Great to have Kulu back, what a magician","I'm truly baffled as to why we can't give Perisic a try on the right. His crosses from the rightside corners are amazing. That would give more room fir Son to operate, and park Emerson's ass on the bench (really want to like him and as a hardworking individual I do, but he is NOT a RWB).

The whole world has figured out that you keep a deep line, clog the middle and we are sh*t because our current leftside is broken with Son/Perisic and the rightside without Kulu is just wank.

Perisic on the right would add: 

1. Good, accurate crosses into the middle, and some creativity from the righr and 

2. Free up space for Sonny to do what Sonny does best, half space off the ball movements which room is needed. Perisic seems to occupy the more space near the box where Sonny works best therefore congesting the area with more defenders.

I miss Kulu.,Can someone explain what we have to do next round to advance?,Lucky goals and dreadful performance by us. Standard for Old Trafford.,,Bryan Gil brought the Chaos. What an outrageous cameo. Completely ruins a free run at goal. Then proceeds to take the ball back and send the defender flying for a penalty. Should have easily scored a goal if Kane didn‚Äôt fall off the cliff in extra time.,"- Emerson should never kick a ball for us again. Not just for the red but because he is arguably the worst RB we‚Äôve had in years.
- Conte being stubborn over Emerson + not picking the right formation (352) cost us. 
- Romero has not been at it this season 
- Perisic struggled today

In short, Conte needs to get over what ever issue he has with Spence and start crafting him into the RWB we need. It‚Äôs embarrassing now the love he gives Emerson. Hopefully that‚Äôs him done now. There are no more excuses to play him.","Solid game. Nothing spectacular. Gonna have to be better to beat Liverpool, MC, and Arse.","We should give Emerson the MOTM. Man really stepped our wingback game up just by not playing today.
I will not be missing him.",WHEN THE SPURS GO MARCHING IN,Get Emerson Royal out of the team.

commentator had an agenda against him i swear. made him look worse than he was","Very different game compared to the previous few. Noticeably more in control and progressive.

Lloris - fantastic. Made several critical saves to keep our score at 1-0 early on. While we were dominant, Fulham had decent attempts on goal.

Lenglet - wouldn't say he is a clear upgrade over Davies. Similar to Spence vs Emerson, one is good going forward and the other is a defensive rock. Lenglet was very progressive and defensively, kept Mitrovic in check.

Dier and Romero - instrumental. Southgate is an idiot. I love Eric Dier and Eric Dier loves me. Romero was very progressive. Comfortable in possession compared to Sanchez. Of course, Sanchez is a rock too so good for us to have 2 great players in one position.

Hojbjerg and Bentancur - ran the midfield. No words to describe. We need them both in the team. I reckon Skipp could deputise for Hojbjerg and Bissouma for Bents but if H&B are fit, they should play every game. Never ever give Hojbjerg space, he will make you pay.

Emerson - Defensively very sound as always. Participated actively in the attack, improving every game. Crossing needs work but makes up for it in energy. All over the place from minute 1.

Sess - sound going forward and Defensively but have to say, a little below his usual standards. Should have passed but went for goal which shows his confidence but not the best play to maximize our chances of winning. Will get there.

Son - I didn't want him to start but he looked much better this game. Looked sharper and progressed our attacks. Engine seems to be revving again, rapid going forward whenever he has a chance. Has high standards of himself which is great but grew more frustrated with every goalless minute. Needs a goal to have his confidence back, where is Norwich when you need them.

Richy - I thought Richy is like Berbatov with half the laziness. Good touches and flicks, alert in attack (could have done better to connect with a volley late on) but heavy on the through pass (twice). Nevertheless, looked to be a brilliant signing so far. Not as rapid as Son, looked slower than Kane but oozes quality with every touch. I don't like how he is walking alot though. Whenever someone gets a shot on target and the keeper spills it, I always see Richy 2 paces away. Anyway, scoring from Son's pass would be grand. Guess he will grab his first against Man City. Matter of time.

Kane - irreplaceable. When not scoring, guiding the ball smoothly linking midfield and attack.

Generally, I liked how our team looked with Lenglet with Richarlison starting. Bents and Hojbjerg is literally and metaphorically the center of everything positive and we need to make sure they are in tip top health considering that our midfield options are thin with Skipp out. Kulu didn't look great when he came on - top 4 needs more gelling in my opinion despite people rushing to claim that Son and Richarlison play very well together."

Such a great win,sign stellini up,"Do you know what bothers me the most? That I think some of the team's problems can be solved, but they just don't want to be solved. Son's performance has been rubbish since the start of the season, remember which game he scored a fucking hattrick? Starting off the bench, which he needs to be there, they signed Richarlison for absolutely nothing because Conte seems so uninterested in being firm and making decisions, but he just doesn't care about the team. The defense is rubbish, there's no other way to describe it, Romero is the best CB and Davies SOMETIMES has good games, apart from them there's no quality and they didn't bother to sign any quality players. Porro's game today is the first for the team, he has a season and a half to adapt and show his quality, on the left wing Perisic has quality but sometimes he can't find someone to play with because it's Kane who comes down to the midfield to create some fucking football, since this shitty system of only two midfielders makes us look like a shitty team that depends on Kane, once again.",We needed Destiny Udogie this season.,I think lloris cost us the game. 2nd half performance was good and we had good chances.,Why do I always choose to wake up at 3am to watch this rubbish,"My thoughts: 
richy getting fit can‚Äôt come soon enough hopefully by the time we play city. It‚Äôs time for him and sonny to switch. 

Hats off to the defense for a clean sheet especially the way we play. Letting them have the ball in our half a lot of the time. 

I‚Äôm ready for a bissouma hojberg switch too. I want to see bissouma and bentancur play as we head into this stretch of 2023.

Conte wants his players to follow his system.

Was reported before that Emerson was ahead of Doherty because Emerson was the one in training that picked up what Conte wanted quicker than the other.

Deki is massive, and having him back, and being another match closer to January window where we can hopefully get a another wide creative threat to cover him is essential.


Helps also that United and Chelski both lost to soften the blow. We go again and see what a difference Deki makes.


Benta and Hojbjerg fantastic as always, and in the end, the difference today was an individual error. I thought Lenglet was exceptional today though. Really starting to like him, and he played inch perfect diagonals CONSTANTLY. Love it. Bad result, lots of positives though overall. The fight is still there, and the first goal, whatever, second was the individual error, so can't really complain on the whole, because 1-0, then going to 1-1 is a MUCH different circumstance","Gil over Lucas.

-Kane‚Äôs hold up play, ability to draw fouls, dribble on tight spaces, are so underrated imo. Such great center forward play even if he didn‚Äôt score. 
-Bentancur always does this where he just presses every fucking player who has the ball, he has great timing in just taking the ball away and immediately starting a break. Dribbling in our box but so composed. Guy is like the definition of smooth. Serious kudos to our scouting team or whenever wanted to sign them.
-Before this we had Winks and Sissoko in bad form. Ndombele who would never run.. now we have two guys who can lead a two man midfield.

We‚Äôll fix our issues once Sonny gets in form, Kulu comes back, Romero as well.

Bin players who are at their 30s and replace them with young relentless players. Too many players have stayed long here, without enough competition, in comfortable environment. It's time for a start over with a young ambitious manager, who can push and ask players to put their everything, has authorities to choose who to be in his squad in long term. I've been thinking this ever since Poch was sacked. I love Mou but timing of his appointment was a mistake.

That was dogshit. Bissouma can't keep a ball to save his life, in a game that needed us to relax the game and ease the pressure we panicked for 90mins. Both goals came from defender issues, and as much as Davies and Dier are usually solid they were just not on it tonight.

Lloris was glorious and it doesn't mean anything. Bentancur ran his ass off and it doesn't matter.

Spence and Lucas showed a little bit of thrust when they FINALLY got sent on and it's too late, Conte just didn't adjust the game at all - I know he shits on the 'fans should be fans' thing but this REEKED of Nuno sitting there not doing anything. Cut Bissouma at 50mins and put Skipp on, or Spence or Lucas, MAKE a threat happen.

It was a particular friend who used to do that celebration whenever he scored.

'It was tough when I was a kid and he did a lot for me when I was young. It‚Äôs just to show to him that I will remember him always when I score and it‚Äôs just a little dedication to him. He watches every game as well. He is one of my best friends.

Clearly we prefer to sit back most of the time but there's times where the players look to apply pressure off the ball.

At the start in a 3-5-2 we looked keen to press high with energy. Later in the game we dropped off, and as I've noticed all season our 'pressing' consists of Pierre saying ""come on push up"" with his arms out, which is followed by the slowest, loosest press and they only need 2 simple passes to get through.

Also I don‚Äôt care what anyone says, we‚Äôve had an extremely overhyped transfer window.
West Ham had more quality on the ball, our midfield was useless again and offered no options for progression with so many backwards passes and also Bissouma lost his man for their goal.

Performance was objectively subpar, but we're playing a high press team where Hugo was a liability and made things shaky in the back. Our midfield was missing Benta's progression and I was hoping for more from Yves to make some forward passes rather than continuously passing backwards. Without distribution or a solid midfield, we really have no way to properly launch an attack. 

Not defending Son or saying that Conte shouldn't have rotated - but I still don't get how people are saying that the dropped points were because of the attacking line. Today was all about the shaky defense + midfield. Even if Richarlison was on, do you really think that we would've accomplished more? West Ham did a good job keeping Son/Kane/Kulu quiet.

Positive: Despite playing like shit at no point did I actually feel scared w/ the defense looking really stable

Negative: That whole Dier-Davies then hoof it up was the extent of the buildup from the back in the 1st half

Looks like Conte switched it up a bit w/ Emerson drifting into the middle 

Son looked like shit b/c he's in bad form AND they're marking the shit out of him and he needs space to run - he needs someone to feed him the ball when making these runs or like Kane to drop int o a false nine role to free up space - I'm sure Conte will find a way to get him involved more soon

Did not like that we lacked the quick transition into the opponent's half that was so characteristic last season when things were good

With only 2 in the central midfield we NEED our wingbacks to contribute more in the buildup process, and Emerson looks a lot better inj taking up space, and on defense, on ball he still wasted a lot of possessions

- Harry seems to be dropping deep less and it's completely hampered any creativity through the middle of the pitch.

- Son is making it easy, but I want to see more minutes for Richy.

- I also want more minutes for Bissouma. Using that guy to hang onto a lead for the final 10 minutes is a great luxury to have but also seems like a waste of his abilities.  I'm sure more rotation will come as the schedule gets more congested.

e: Also, we did it better than the runners against Leicester:)))",How much is Brighton going to fuck is up in the weekend?,What happens now when Conte got red? Is he gone for our Wolves game? Lol,fuckity fuck fuck fuck,Perisic has more quality on the ball than everyone else in defense and midfield combined. Fucking cowardly to play like that when West Ham weren't even trying in the first half,"Not great but we just keep winning.

Son gotta be on the bench for Saturday surely. 

He looks so so off it.",Who‚Äôs the logical replacement for Emerson? Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a change there at some point. He‚Äôs had some good plays but he doesn‚Äôt seem to bring much in the attack (maybe I‚Äôm wrong).,We would NOT be winning this game last season. COYS,Honestly just love richarlison he plays with so much passion.
167,I‚Äôm done.,"Pathetic performance all round. You are not allowed to say anything bad about Sanchez or the Mods will remove it ‚Ä¶ however he might be the worst player I‚Äôve ever seen at spurs. 

We had such a good chance to potentially win this years FA cup.. just so disappointed as usual",MoTM Skipp,"Shouldn‚Äôt ever wish bad on other teams except Woolwich, but I‚Äôd love it if West Ham went down..love it",Not a fun few days.,"Idk it seems to me like Conte won‚Äôt be sacked and we won‚Äôt bring anyone in this window and it‚Äôs just going to be a let‚Äôs hope for a miracle in the FA Cup or CL kinda situation. Then bring in a new manager this summer and see what their opinion is of the loaned out players, etc and go from there. What a shit situation and this all falls on ENIC, Levy, and the Board. Conte has some blame as well because he‚Äôs not adapting to our players strengths and so many have utterly regressed under him. It‚Äôs all just fucked. Anyways‚Ä¶.COYS","Just fuck off Conte. Tactical dinosaur who seems to be on a mission to one up himself every week with even shitter tactics, line ups and substitutions. 

He‚Äôs not a project manager, there is no point backing him financially and giving him time. We will just sign up a bunch of 30 year olds on big money that we can‚Äôt shift when he inevitably walks. Devastating we never went for Howe when he was available 

Our scouts can fuck off too. We‚Äôve spent hundreds of millions on fullbacks and they are all utter wank. Embarrassing.",Well that was fucking dreadful. Levy you bald cunt that 30m better be a typo.,He was great. Whatever positional adjustment that was made got him central and had Kulu as kind of a RWBwhile giving the CMs some help to the left side of the flank. It was a genius little switch.,And a LOT of snow,A new Mousa is born in our midfield,Why do we still have the issue of the on-field ref not going over to the monitor to make an important call?,"Yeah, plenty to cheer for after paying insane money for the tickets.",Man of the match has to be between Bentancur and Perisic.. bentancur‚Äôs pressing and skill in the second half brought Spurs back into the game and perisic‚Äôs class on set pieces plus his huge block were equally massive,We got through another game guys,This is not football,,Somehow feel better after that loss about our season than I have about any win we‚Äôve had,"Great effort to come back from 2 down, but we shouldn‚Äôt be down 2.",Our defense just look lost with any sort of press and can't connect a pass. Need to gain more confidence. It's still mentality.,"Results aside, that was one of the most entertaining 2nd halves I've seen. Gil was everything we thought he would be.",Man that went about as fun as a kick in the nuts,,"Bad half to have a serious work call...

Thank Christ I've developed a habit of hitting mute every time I finish speaking","Mou would have been shredded by the press and fans alike for that performance. Nuno got fired for a similar result and similarly ineffective football. I'm not saying Conte needs to go, but he needs to be held to the same standards and needs to take accountability/make changes.","352+Doherty is the way forward, at least when Kulusevski is not available. Even when he returns, it should be used far more often.",Not pretty. But 3 points away against a good Brighton team will do just fine.,"Did our formation or tactic change as Conte started making the substitutions? It allowed for our Mids to feed Son far more. Son‚Äôs first two goals were also reminiscent of his usual bangers with a slight cut from the wing - something he wasn‚Äôt able to do in previous games, so I‚Äôm wondering what change happened and if it was a cause in his drought.","Why is this team so adamant on playing defensive football. We've not at any point in the last few years looked anything like the team Pochettino created back in 2016. We look like we regress every year in spite of the quality of our players getting better. We haven't had a team as good as this one in decades and yet they play worse than Harry Redknapp's team, a team with significantly worse quality players (even if a lot of them are club heroes and loved players, they weren't as good as a lot of our current team). We have no identity on the pitch and the players don't put any soul into the game. The only ones with any chemistry between each other are Bentancur and H√∏jbjerg these days, which is fucking terrible considering our front line don't know how to link up and one of our wing backs literally can't cross a ball accurately. This team is a bloody mess and we're not playing to its strengths whatsoever because Conte is just sticking to this exact same system that has made us look weak all season. Out of every match we've played I'd say we've looked good for a grand total of maybe 180 minutes. The rest of it has been messy and poor quality. Conte is a wolrd class manager but our team looks fucking terrible right now",I fucking love antonio conte.,"ummm, royal. time to rotate please!","Missed opportunity. Game was there for the taking but we didn‚Äôt even come out for the second half, Pierre was fucking around with his boots and we seemed to want to just run down the clock and then couldn‚Äôt get going, even worse, self destructed with that totally avoidable concession. What the fuck you doing lads, wake up.","If I'm Conte I play Richy, Kane and Kulusevski on the weekend. Sub Son by all means later but he can't start at the moment, he's dwelling on the ball so often.","Will come back on the sub tomorrow. The disrespect I'm seeing towards some of our players is disheartening. There's a lot to say about our performance but I'll leave it for tomorrow.

Enjoy the win and the Sunday!",Set piece coach paying dividends.,Mitro didn't really need to give us that late anxious feeling we all know too well smh
168,Horrible top to bottom,Honestly numb to the embarrassment at this point,"Stadium was electric, back three was fantastic. We beat Chelsea!",RoyalZINHO,"I know Conte won't change this system, but a poor back 5 hanging and waiting to deal with good chances being build up because our midfield is bypassed (having 2 wingers not suited for defending) is why we are leaking so much, that's why so many of our fanbase got hyped with a 3-5-2 some time ago (which over relies on Kane and Son being on form).",Any chance of getting seven players in January?,Enic out,Good to have Romero back! We need at least ¬£400m to completely rebuild this team.,His fitness is so good just so solid on the last few minutes there especially. Say what you will but dude always gives 100%,"Understandable, didn‚Äôt know if it was something more serious, kinda looked like he was fully crying from the glimpse they showed",Missed the game. How was Harvey White?,That sun was killing us today. Imagine having a football match and setting up a floodlight ten feet in the air and blinding one teams defence for 45 minutes. That‚Äôs the effect it had.,Good. There is zero reason to cheer or be happy.,OH WHAT A NIIIIIGHT,eyyyyy cheeky match of the day tonight,"Blessing in disguise, we weren‚Äôt going to win it, a lot better than losing in the semi finals. No midweek games until mid January, let‚Äôs fucking go",,"I feel like this was end to end one of our best games of the year. 

The Dier blunder was a killer. Gotta be better, but mistakes happen. 

This is a different team with Kulusevski. 

Should have had something from this.",We need more Juve rejects.,"Had Son took a real shot on goal rather than a cute little chip attempt early in the match, things could have been very different. Oh well","Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but we‚Äôre through to the knockouts with a draw at the Velodrome? Not ideal but‚Ä¶",That was bad enough to have shaken my faith in the entire Conte project tbh. Utterly execrable.,,I‚Äôd like for players like Gil to get more minutes,"Shit result, but not too dejected. 1-1 then a poor player error followed by a red card which left us short at the back. On a day without the error and the card we keep it at 1-1 and come away with a point. Still, it‚Äôs worrying - 8 games in and I haven‚Äôt seen us play well yet. Yes we‚Äôve won games, but we haven‚Äôt played well at all.",I wouldn't be surprised if we contained Haland in a 3-5-2. Just make Bissouma screen him all game and have Hoj + Bentacur bulldoze everyone like they usually do in a 3-4-3,Could have done with another goal or two to settle the nerves,"I haven't had the chance to watch any of the games until today so I'm wondering how others felt this performance was in comparison to others? Mainly curious about how some of the buildup and attacking sequences looked since I've been hearing some concerns about it on this sub. 

Obv with a grain of salt since it was against Leicester who have been terrible this season and looked completely out of it in the last twenty minutes.","Rooting for the Dodgers and Spurs could not be any more different.

Though at least it‚Äôs not as bad as the Lakers since the Westbrick trade",All I wanted for my birthday was a Tottenham win but this will do too!!! What a fucking game!!,We deserved this. Conte deserved this. This is what happens when you don't play your best players. This is what happens when you keep starting players who don't contribute. This is what happens when you don't use your subs.,I always tell myself I‚Äôm going to stop letting this club ruin my days but I haven‚Äôt quite succeeded yet,"How would we look if we sat Kane and ran with Son, Richarlison, Kulu?","Honestly there's a fucking meltdown in here once again and no one seems to have targeted the right player for the right reason. 

Sanchez was good but needs to stop ignoring Dier when he tells him what to do with the fucking ball. That's what his job is Davi. Fucking pay attention.

PEH needs to stop engaging ""SULKY LITTLE BITCH MODE"" at 100% when the rest of the team disagree with him. He's making himself look like Henderson in an England shirt. 

Sonny just needs one fucking goal and he'll be fine. I swear. That's all. He always loses his shit when he's playing badly because he seems to have ridiculous standards that none of us would inflict on him.",Richarlison is fckin class.,"My nerves are completely shot, but we got the 3 points"
169,This sport is so shit,Why get these winner managers. Bring poch back,Lenglet with Davies outside him is an absolutely crucial find for our defensive set up. They‚Äôve become greater than the sum of their parts.,Thought on Lenglet today? Was really pleased with him and Dier,At least Arsenal drew?,"Missed 85 mins of the game, but saw Lenglet completely forget he was playing a professional football match. Can someone sum it up for me?","To anyone who blames conte, there isn‚Äôt a single manager in history who could win anything with players like Lloris, Dier and Sessengon in the squad","Good time to be shit, hopefully it‚Äôll put pressure on levy to pull out his pockets and sign some decent players","Lloris always has a better game when he is allowed to sometimes hoof the ball forward. 

Its like thinking too much about passing is affecting his shot stopping","EVVVVVVRYBODY WILL BE SINGING,

WHEN THE SPURS GO MARCHING IN.",Thank fuck for that,"We were not good today, but tbh I‚Äôm done watching games where ludicrous VAR decisions pollute my enjoyment.

I feel like a mug tbh, supported video ref for years but since its implementation I just don‚Äôt enjoy games regardless of result. I really love football but despise this ill-managed mess.

COME ON YOU FUCKING SPURS!!!!üòÜüòÜüòÜü§çü§çü§ç,"I have six weeks, please no injuries","Lol whys everyone blaming the players. If this was Mourinho you'd be calling for his head.

Conte has the better players, he has been backed better. 2 wins in 7, 8 games without scoring in the first half, 3 losses in a row. If he doesn't fix up he has to go. This is literally dog water managerial performance from this old geezer.",,We are improving on and off the ball tbf. Some positive takeaways despite the loss.

coys coys coys",,"Emerson almost single handedly drew this game. 

Conceded the corner because he can‚Äôt control a ball, then got out jumped on that corner to make it 3-2.

Get in the üöÆ along with your oxygen chamber.",Really hope we see Spence get some minutes now.,A little bit worrying that it took an injury to force Conte to do this though: I would have thought it would be the obvious thing to do while Deki is out.,Job Done ‚úÖ,Please can we play with 3-5-2 more often,We are mud,"Romero lucky two weeks in a row not to see a yellow or red. Love the man, but he's got to cool his jets a bit. Hate Chelsea, but can't be pulling a man's hair.","I don't want to see Emerson start again. Why the fuck was he laughing after everything, miss a chance to score 3 times and just laughs. Takes an absolutely retarded yellow and just laughs. He should be pissed with himself for todays game. Not the mentality this team needs from him.",They all looked tired. These extra mid week games are gonna be tough if we can get a good rotation. Bissuma was eh. Hugo was terrible. Harry and dejan looked slow. Time to start richarlison,Son has to be on the bench next game,Why was the Forrest keeper wearing a hat?,"Workmanlike win. Three points 

Perisic was awesome. Game to forget for Son. Sanchez did alright filing in for Cuti.

Top of the league for now. Up the Spurs","We made that more exciting than it should have been, but the scoreline really flatters Fulham. Our best performance of the season so far, I thought. Richarlison was fantastic."

His touch last night was better than kanes sons and richies.

I reckon with Conte in charge the man will go on improving and become a legend.
Even Romero passed to him last night.
For those of you who remember Chris Hughton as a player (and what a player coys to the core) he suffered the same doubts.",We deserved nothing from that game and got a point. Outstanding!,Is this when the clowns turn on Conte?,Couldn't watch the game but from past games it seems Kane - Son chemistry has gone sour and Kanes not looking to feed Son like he used to anymore. Is this because Conte is looking to diversify the attack?,"Got away with it once again, before the red card we were really struggling.

Downvote me, I don‚Äôt care. Sick of his shit football, terrible rotations and whining. The way he has treated Spence is appalling too",,Eric Maguire,"What have we learned? Bentancur is our most important player.

The Pigeon is my new favourite bird.

Harry Kane playing shit, missing passes and shots, still winning us the game is a testament to how good he is. He has so much influence in play.

My thoughts.","Son didn't play as badly as everyone is making out, it's just that now our expectations are higher. Stick with Sonny wouldn't be surprised if he gave a 10/10 performance next game!",Dat Lloris save at 2-1 88'! Anyone got a link?

Edit: as in something has happened to Bissouma and he's turned awful",our games are an emotional rollercoaster. I cant even tell if im enjoying it or im hating it,needed that win. Gained points on Man city COYS,"Another appalling performance

I‚Äôve got a serious question for those who‚Äôs still backing Conte, when us who criticised Conte got told we‚Äôre still winning games, what do you say now that we no longer winning games? I thought the fanbase accepted we don‚Äôt play entertaining football but said the results are the most important things, so now that we play shit football and don‚Äôt get results, what‚Äôs the excuse now? 

Genuine question 

Conte Out",,When Alisson came to punch the ball but missed and only smashed into Doherty instead how is that not a penalty?,Game completely changed once Sanchez was taken off. Can't have a player on the pitch who's a complete zero (at best) on the ball.,"My 2 main takeaways from this game:





1. Rodrigo Bentancur is showing week in and week out what it means to be a perfect box to box midfielder. So many useful through balls, so many tackles, interceptions, and deep runs that are freeing up space for the front 3. Exceptional.





2. I know he wasn't directly at fault for anything today, and that's exactly why I want to say this now. I 
get supporting your players even if they're flawed, I get being positive, I get getting behind them, all of that. But how can you lot be ok with Sanchez playing for this club is beyond me. Being big and strong, and relatively fast doesn't make you a football player. Let alone one in the EPL. It makes you a bouncer. And that's how he plays, like someone who worked a bouncers shift last night and got called up for spurs today. THE MAN IS AFRAID EVERY TIME HE'S ON THE BALL. And the rest of us, and his teammates are also afraid. For a reason.",definitely want to see more minutes for gil!,"Calm down, guys.

It's one of the 5 hardest fixtures in a very long season. We have played bad, but we are winning every match outside the big six, which is more important.",,This match seriously pissed me off. Why were we sitting back against 10 men when we're up 3-1? G/D may be the difference in this group and we're inviting pressure like they're Man City or something. On the bright side Sonny is back and Gil looked like Maradona with drawing the penalty.,"The only good thing to come out of this game is Emerson not playing in the next 3. I hope to god this sub finally starts to see sense now and see him for the total waste of space he is. Don't care if he's funny on twitter or a lovely bloke. I have mates who are lovely blokes and funny, but I don't want them playing for spurs. He can get in the fucking bin, average player.","That was very nice to see, Doherty is solid",Conte MASTERCLASS.,"I am really glad Conte showed much better tactical flexibility this game. Lessons need to be learned from CL. Fabio still has work to do in Jan. but we have some options. Would really like see Doherty, Spence, Gil, Sarr be tested in a low-stakes competition. Some could develop into depth options & decisions needed about others.","This is by no means the only positive from this match, but the biggest one for me, was Romero. He really played like his olf self. Flawless defending.

On the other hand. Sonny... What is going on with that guy. Sure, Harry and Richy weren't great at linking up as well but Sonny was specifically horrid.

Also, you lot wouldn't believe the grin on my face when I saw Gil coming on. But boy did he prove me wrong, and Conte and co. right. He looked like a boy amongst men.

And last but not least, I'm pretty sure Ivan is the one who knows Conte's system the best. So I guess he's the one that's in the right for the most times. That's why I got confused and couldn't even keep count of how many times he made deep runs behind Frankfurt's back and Lenglet and Hojbjerg a couple of times positioned themselves like they're making that pass to him but it was always a fake and a pass back and a frustrated Perisic. Don't know why.",Thomas Tuchels and absolute fuckin weirdo man!,"I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason to melt down. Bad result but the attack will click, our players are very good. 

Absolutely should‚Äôve made more subs tho","We‚Äôre still unbeaten, but Christ did we looked poor, Lloris looked distracted, the Sanchez-Royal road to nowhere, Son trying too hard to break his duck and Bissouma looking frazzled. And the lack of subs. Squad depth? What‚Äôs that?","Son was truly abysmal. I love him but he's clearly not right, feels like he's slow and thus hesitant.","Richy should be coming on a lot earlier, would like to see a bit more for Biss as well instead of him coming in at the 80th. It was certainly a weird and stressful (as usual) match, a goal right off the start - pure shit from everyone then a classic Kane out of nowhere header (after having missed a penalty which was shocking). I'm sure Sess was subbed in purely to rest Perisic - otherwise it didn't make sense, Sess was underwhelming and I didn't realize he was even playing until the end where he failed to deliver a clear cross to Kane (though it led to Richy making up for it). Forrest must have sucked the referee off prior because there were tons of fouls that were let off and particularly the more than obvious handball which should have been a immediate red. Son played bad, and it's hard to argue with that - even if you love him like I do - though calling for his head is fucking ridiculous. Sky Sports commentator suck ass, they can't be more obvious that they don't like us and bitch about everything every game.",[deleted],"Extremely frustrating watch when they got one back because we had come so close so many times before that. Still, great win and composure at the end!"
173,Glad we practiced that finishing,Some clubs are just too filled up with losers to win anything.,3 point lane,"Logically Son off the bench makes sense, his pace and direct runs against tired legs will be good. Think Richy did a good job playing that role today. He needs to start more games, no harm in rotating the front 3 more. 

Skipp was fantastic again, Romero shutting down the doubters with a solid performance.

Only thing to do.,Conte got an red card for asking why,"Lloris by far our best player. Ben Davies behind him but outside of that, yeesh.

Just bad all around",,"That extra time was something else. But yea, this game confirms to me that we can play really nice football. We can never sub PEH again, ever. 

Emerson is just not good enough. You can't give me a taste of Doherty and then go back to the Emerson disasterclass. 

Sadly Hugo was sloppy again, his misstakes just keeps piling up.","I think this was a painful but needed wake up call to show the people here that both Lloris and Emerson just can't start anymore. Emerson was always a backup level player, and Lloris is getting too old and cost us too many mistakes like this and I swear we must have lost around 5 or 6 matches last season from blunders like these. I know Lloris fans are pretty adamant around here, but father nature takes its toll on everyone. He's just not as good as he used to be and that's OK.

As long as we keep winning, I don't care if he never scores again, I'm happy if he starts. Football isn't all stats, if Son is being covered, and pulling players away from Kane, making aggressive runs, trying crazy passes, then he's doing good for the team overall. And maybe Richarlison is better as a super sub, a fresh pair of legs after Son stretches their defenders.

It's clear a lot of people here have low football IQ and just listen to the stupid takes and stats on Sky.",All changed when we took off son and added bissouma.

I also have to say I don‚Äôt get why we brought lenglet, it‚Äôs not surprising but he‚Äôs not good enough to play first team PL football, and we already have better players, Peresic is also a big question mark for me, he can be a decent replacement but first team ?",Swap keepers and we're win that match.

I understand Kane has his accolades as a player but whenever we struggle I can't seem to find anything he provides to the team, like his one good aspect (which isn't as consistent as it should be for a player rated as highly as him) is finishing, and he hardly ever showcases ability to do anything else. He can't dribble, he can't beat a defender to the ball in a sprint, and his passing ability doesn't show itself often. Am I missing something as to why he's so highly rated and his spot at the top is guaranteed every game? If I'm misjudging his game and need to view it differently, please let me know.

>Playing with Son right now is like playing with a hand tied behind our backs. Playing with Lloris is like playing Russian roulette every time a ball is in our box.

- Too much ball given away in the first half,we won‚Äôt get away with that against better team
- Gil‚Äôs strength (lack of)
- unconvinced by Skipp","Brentford should have been down to 9.

1st the defender grabbed our player round the neck and face, that‚Äôs a red

Ref missed a pen for us and 2 reds for Brentford. PL refereeing everybody",Shite,"I know we kinda played like garbage most of the game, and have been playing like garbage recently. BUT, our last games have all been saved by players that aren‚Äôt son or kane.

Ready for a new manager, goalie, and wing-backs.

We're in a steady decline, will finish out of top-6 and soon to crash out of Champions League.",No ones talking about how wet the pitch was,"I get that Conte‚Äôs defensive tactics are to condense the back-line and midfield and stay compact to prevent space in between the lines or in behind, but I think that one of the problems we‚Äôve had all season is not pressing at least within our final third. I just don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve gotten the balance of when to sit and when to close down right so far. It‚Äôs a bigger issue the better the quality of the opposition because they‚Äôre more likely to do something with the space and time they‚Äôre given just outside the box. I also think the 5-3-2 exacerbates this because without the wingers dropping back to defend we‚Äôre giving up even more space out wide. This has all been compounded by an almost bizarre lack of composure and ability to keep possession in attack. We've often opted to slow play down rather than go for fast breaks this season and I think considering our lack of ability to build-up in attack the team would do better playing with a little more urgency and attempting to hit more on the counter again. 

Ultimately, I think away losses at the Emirates and Old Trafford aren‚Äôt beyond the pale, but we do need to eventually pick up the odd win away from home if we truly want to start competing at the top. I still feel fine with how we‚Äôre doing overall though. I think we‚Äôre a couple of tweaks and players coming back into form away from being more convincing. A signing or two in January might also be what makes a difference. Gotta move on and focus on getting the win against Newcastle at the weekend for now.",,"Conte may well storm off with the bump because we fell asleep and finished the game nervous. 

However - the wholesale changes don't help. It completely ruins the continuity of the players and disrupts the game. 

For example: we started with Hojbjerg and Bentancur in the middle. But finished with Bisouma and Skipp (a completely different midfield).... Richarlison went off and we switched to 3-5-2... Moura and Gill came in so we switched back to 3-4-3. The Dier being swapped to Sanchez.

At this rate it will take another 2 years for him to become a good wingback, which is what we need in a Conte system. Kane, Son, Bentancur, Davies and Romero were all very poor as well. The quickfire 2 goals were pure Tottenham. Disappointing stuff. On to the next.","One of the worst second halves I've seen from this team in years. Bissouma must have been instructed to recycle the ball backward, because that's all he did. Hugo had a great first half and a dogshit second half; their goal was so awful to concede, so easily prevented. Should have put Skipp on for PEH, who was obviously struggling. Kulusevski was the only really creative player, to take him off and not Son, who needs to step up (I have faith that he will), was a terrible choice. 


Oh well. Point away, didn't lose. We go again. Also fuck that soft ref.",Oh what a night....,Bad passing and finishing. Terrible VAR decision. We could have won much higher.

Of course, Spurs are Spurs and there no telling what might happen.","First off, Leicester had our number, they played great. Their press was energetic and they won so many 50/50s and 2nd balls. They were excellent in transition and finishing. 

We were getting overrun from the middle of the first half. Clearly there was a problem but Conte seemed bereft of ideas. Porro was abysmal in defense but it was a rude welcome to the PL and surely he‚Äôll improve, he showed real promise going forward. Im not sure how we will fair with Forster for nearly 2 months.

I‚Äôm not sure what Conte is doing here but if he won‚Äôt sign a contract and build for the future, and he doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs gonna be a ‚Äúwin now‚Äù manager, and he doesn‚Äôt play entertaining football, what‚Äôre we doing? We need direction in this club.","We need to accept we‚Äôre not a top 4 team anymore. Don‚Äôt renew Conte, let Hugo go, maybe sell Kane, hire a manager that can manage a rebuild, play to Son‚Äôs strengths again as he probably doesn‚Äôt have much sale value, and do what Arsenal did for a few years while we rebuild.

Absolutely buzzing for Son, and Kane and Sarr were terrific.

The cleansheet was hugely needed too.","First match back after a busy World Cup for spurs players, playing a decent team away, missing some key players. 2-2 is fine for me and we could‚Äôve won it tbh",Mostly poor.,"I need to come clean with Tottenham.

Looking like a worse decision every single match to go into the season without a single midfielder capable of picking a pass through the middle of the field.

Also some of that defending looked like my adult league team when we start to get leggy and can't react fast enough to keep up with a quick attacker. If the team's already looking tired it's going to be a long and painful season.",,"Son MOTM, Gil's wild gait reminds me of Kane when he first started and people said he looked like a dumb zebra when he ran. Impressed me.

I hope Conte can have a talk with Kane about free kicks. If he can't even be automatic with penalties, it's really time to try someone else.","It's time to move on. I will love Hugo for his 10 years of service, he pretty much deserves a statue but everyone reaches a point when they are no longer good enough and if we are ever to be consistent enough to win anything we can't have a keeper that gifts several chances a game through poor distribution and lets in 10+ goals a year from horrendous errors. I don't think we'll get a keeper as iconic and with such highs as Hugo again but we can 100% get someone that performs to 95% of his capcity without the insane ammount errors he's done the last few seasons. 

PS: Oliver Skipp is still fucking fantastic in his Cameo he was calm and collected and just went on with his job for the entire game even when a man down .",Can you explain the meme? Not sure where this came about,"Positive: We won while not playing at our best.  
Negative: Still lots of room for improvement, especially passing in the final third.","352 made a world of difference but Leicester had pretty much given up by that point. It will be interesting to see what Conte does going forward. Bentancur and PEH were so much better with Bissouma, it was like night and day. The former was my MOTM until Son did Son things.",Thank God my internet shat the bed two thirds of the way through,So fucking happy with a point,Let‚Äôs sign all these players for rotation and then not use them at all. Garbage.,We saw a glimpse of Sonny with that great run in right before halftime. It's only a matter of time before he gets his form back. Don't complain when Kane couldn't find his form for months and wanted to leave the club early last season. I swear some of you are forgetful about what sonny has achieved just 5-6 matches ago.,"What a horrendous performance.

Hugo out.  He's a complete buffoon back there.  Bring in Forster.  Don't care how much you all downvote me. It's the truth.","Conte masterclass right there. Forest have 56% possession but one shot all game. Like how they play though, hope they stay up.",And now an easy win please. My butt won‚Äôt hold it for another game,"I think we've seen Conte's solution to the constant midfield and CB back-and-forth being stuck behind a press.

 Looks like Dier was instructed to step forward when the LCB/RCB have the ball wide so he can receive it into that midfield space. Changing that shape can progress the ball and find space for the midfielders to get around the press. Perhaps that's the plan to avoid the constant cycling between center backs and PEH/Bentancur. It also gave Dier a chance to support wingbacks if the ball swung wider up the field.

Saw it more in the first half, but it wasn't needed in the second."
187,Every single big club won this weekend. You heard it right,what  is the point honestly,Stellini....job application accepted.,"Davies actually fits the Conte WB mould pretty well. Physical, strong on and off the ball, a half decent cross and confident in the final third.

I'm no strategy expert, but why does it feel like pre and post World Cup, and really from the start of the season, it looks like all we've been trying for are low percentage crosses into the box.

Last season we were keeping up with teams on quick counters, and it is something that both Kane and Son are great at, so why not mix some of that in? Because what we're doing now is obviously NOT working.","I completely agree, they did us proud.

Tears in my eyes,"Sell Kane&Sonny, it's time to let them go.","There's no doubt they're behind Conte as well, hear ""Antonio"" chanted regularly.",hoj has been off it since november,"Bryan reminds me a little of all the tape I‚Äôve seen of George Best when he first came into the league as a scrawny 17 year old. Absolute chaos, all energy and drive, insane technicality (better than Bryan but this is George Best) and fouled to all eternity when they could catch him. 

As Best developed he got a little stronger on the ball but more critically he learned how to be smarter in terms of how he played. Still fouled to death but smarter about it, if that makes sense. 

I think Bryan is too light/weak to manage the grind of the PL but if he can get stronger and smarter then he could turn out to be a very good player. I love his drive and attitude. Never quits. Needs to learn when to do so, though.","&#x200B;

Embarrassed.",,Fuck this ref Liverpool were playing with 12 today,Love to see our midfielders and defenders score more so teams can‚Äôt just defend Kane and son and take us out of the game anymore,"Been a couple of hours now and I'm still laughing at how Spurs it is to go 1-0 down because of a goal like that.

We've been on the wrong end of GK protection as recently as the Leicester game. But the minute Lloris is blocked off by Wilson and they score, of course there's no foul.

Fouls on the GK are always soft. But can anyone name the last time they saw something like what happened today, where the GK has potentially been fouled with an 'outfield foul' and a goal has been scored with no overturn? Because I can't.

Wilson clearly brings him arm out as Lloris moves the ball past him. After seeing Gabriel escape a red card by deliberately blocking Bamford last week and win the foul in the process, the fact our GK moved the ball beyond the attacker and got blocked with no foul is quite wild given the bullshit we see every week.

The ref was just shit outright. That cunt needs to be packed back up on the plane to Australia and stay reffing down there. He gave two of the softest fouls I've ever seen against Son either side of the Lloris/Wilson one. He also failed to book players for blatant dives.

This isn't me saying that's why lost. He was shit, we were worse.","This isn't even fun. VAR has killed the joy of the game ... except, you know, all those times when it went in our favor.","I think this game revealed the pitfalls of the 352 that everyone is clamouring for.

Also we missed Deki‚Äôs creativity and hold up play.",,Should have put it to bed,"Appalling all round today, with the possible exception of Bentancur and Richarlison.

Emerson shouldn't play again in front of Doherty or Spence.",Right? His dribbling seems to be so much better this year than any previous. He‚Äôs also in the best shape I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve never seen him run away from so many players as he has this season.,"I thought Kane was very, very good in the first half, but his performance really dipped. Looks shattered.

He's gone in the summer anyway, why are we putting up with this and delaying the necessary steps?",Loser mentality,"Stellini's decision to move Davies to lwb is massive. Having two defensively sound wingbacks has taken some of the strain away from our centre backs and allowed Romero and Lenglet some space to move forward and help our midfield in possession, especially when we move up the pitch asymmetrically.

Issues still remain though in terms of figuring out what to do with that possession. Our pressing was a little too easy to play through at times. Eventually the players started to tire, and both the ball movement and off ball movement reaaaaally started to slow to a halt as a result.

Can't fault anyone today.","Tactics were very different today than we've played before. Both Kane and Royal were dropping in and playing as CMs, either alternating or sometimes both together. Often our wing backs were playing as forwards. 

It certainly made it tough for their defence.","I‚Äôve always defended Dier but this game really solidifies it for me, if we want to win things he needs to be a rotation option at best. Conte‚Äôs previous teams would never look this vulnerable at the back","The game, as a collective, was dire and there's a lot to be upset about with the whole team performance. I was particularly frustrated, however, with the performance of Ryan Sessegnon. Sess came on at 69'. He basically was going to play ~25 minutes, all told. There is ***ZERO*** fucking excuse for walking, not joining a play, etc.

I just went back and watched to confirm if I had seen things correctly, and I definitely did. I then noticed it a few times afterward as well.

In the 77th minute, Sess is pressing up past midfield when City plays a nice switched pass. Sess is incredibly slow to recover his defensive position and Llenglet is isolated when a cross is sent in for Haaland, when Sess should've been there in support. A few seconds later, possession is turned over to Spurs and a nice ball is played to Emerson who carries it forward into the midfield. He looks for options. Son is marked tightly, Kane at least comes back for the ball but there's nothing there, and are three men surrounding Emerson to his back and right, denying him the wider pass to Kulusevski (although, I would argue he still should've made the pass).

[But the thing is, I rewatched this 5 times. Sessegnon, after the possession change, fucking WALKS out of his own box. He doesn't head wide to the touchline, he doesn't make an effort to give Emerson a clear drop pass or anything. He fucking walks. There is miles of space to Emerson's left, but no one is there when Sess absolutely should be. It's only when he realizes that Emerson is isolated that he starts to jog forward, but at that point it's too late and possession is immediately turned over. It would be one thing if Sess had started and was too tired to go anymore, but he had been on the pitch for only 8 minutes!](https://imgur.com/a/2zxWdyT)

It's a small moment in a 90-minute game. But for me it encapsulates a) that Sess is nowhere near being a first-team player, and b) the lack of unity and urgency in the squad, especially when chasing a game that is still there for the taking.

Exhausting.",Ramsdale kept them in the game. Overall bad performance from our keeper. That was the difference.,"If it wasn‚Äôt clear the deeper issue is Levy/ENIC, failed the club in every way except lining their own pockets.

It‚Äôs something that (and I hate to say it) Arsenal have been doing really well with Zinchenko all season‚Ä¶ having his starting position be a wingback, but push him into midfield when in possession.","I agree with you, just not your examples.","Was funny being in the Palace end tonight, most of them left around the 65th minute. Gil was energetic today had some fight in him, Sarr was very good, him and Ben10 will be a great duo.

Hojbjerg somehow still is the heart and soul of our midfield when we've known forever that you need a SYSTEM to win second balls not a PLAYER. hojbjerg will never win the midfield battle on his own plodding around putting in shit tackles to hit them on transition.

I DONT WANT A SINGLE ONE OF YOU TO MESSAGE ME TALKING UP HOJBJERG. literally wouldnt play for any other top 10 team in the league. Plods around putting in nothing challenges all game. Even teams like Fulham Crystal Palace Nottingham FOrest have better midfielders with better systems to win them second balls instead of hoping someone like ohjbjerg just wins them all.  
 Even romero is a shell of himself, stepping up and putting in absoultely braindead challenges and ridiculously poor in the air and on the ball. What is he offering this team?

Emerson defensively is pretty good for the most part, but offers very little going forward and doesn't help Kulusevski out much.

Son needs to sit on the bench and take a breather. Richarlison will hold down the fort while he recuperates.

It's the hangover from the last of the Poch era, and the mentality still leaches through the squad. Hugo needs to be replaced, Ben needs to be replaced, Sonny and Harry need a serious kick up the ass.

Find a Hugo replacement, a Davies replacement, a Dier replacement, and a SERIOUS successor to Sonny. Make him work for these last 3 or 4 years of his prime. He's got no serious threat to his position, and instead of reverting back to clean/efficient play when he's struggling, he's trying to do too much, and there's nothing to tell him to stop. And Harry too right now, Harry could use a game or two as a sub, and would benefit if Richy was healthy and could put in some performances worthy of benching him.

Yeah, it was bad. Lloris had to be brilliant to stop certain goals - but that's his job and he's great at it. Bissouma had literally no interest in making a forward pass. Fullbacks offered no attacking threat, as usual. Kane and Son were totally isolated up the pitch. Conte waited forever to make pointless changes.

But if we're examining the actual goals conceded - this was not an awful performance. The first goal is a deflected shot. The second is a bit of brilliance from the edge of penalty box after a blocked shot. Neither goal was down to face-palming mistakes, or being totally outplayed. We really weren't that awful when we did have possession, we just never did much with it. 

United played exactly how I expected them to at Old Trafford; come out the gates swinging, dominate possession, constantly push forward. They played just like how they played against Arsenal and Liverpool - they're decent right now and they have a lot of confidence. 

Conte does have to look at his tactics, absolutely, and quite a few players have to look at themselves, but we also have to acknowledge that our bench is miles behind in terms of attacking quality (I wouldn't even mind having a crybaby striker pushing forty right now) and creative midfield quality. For what he has, and where we are in the table at the moment, I think we shouldn't lose perspective. We're still a really tough team to beat, and you'd think we just rolled over the way everyone is talking in here. It's Old Trafford. A point would have been brutally tough.

I also don't want to hear any excuses for Conte/Stellini about how we were playing a rotated XI. As the commentators were saying, they had an illness in their camp and had to rotate as well. If a top 4 premier league side can't use their bench that they spent nearly 150M on in the summer to upgrade to beat a championship team also using their bench, playing sick players, then maybe, just maybe it's the coaching?

The answer is NO.

Modern football, especially EPL, is primarily a money game. Just like when you play FIFA, you need rare, more expensive players to win. Just look at how City have transformed after the oil money purchased the club. Look at Chelsea and PSG. Imagine what Newcastle would become in a few years after the Saudi takeover.

If we want Spurs to be a title contender, or considered as a consistent Top 4 candidate, we need serious, long-term investments from BIG money. It is apparent ENIC is not.

It would be ideal if we can find a b/trillionnaire who is morally sound and ethical and who wants to support our club by investing A LOT; however, I doubt if that is realistic.

Bad - Sess, Peresic, Lenglet, Romero, Son

Poor - Lloris, Hobjerg, Kulusevski fell off hard probably more due to game conditioning.

Son and Romero are form issues but the left side of our defense is really showing itself to be our weak link. I would‚Äôve liked to see Davies start over Lenglet today, and I think LCB, LWB and then GK need to be our transfer priorities in that order.

I thought Sarr was a bright spot all things considered. Occasion wasn‚Äôt too big for him and he played under control and within himself. Confident touches and crisp passing and no real mental mistakes besides the card.

Lloris was certainly poor today and it‚Äôs time to find his replacement if we have title ambitions I think, but Romero playing Saka onside and then whatever god awful defense Sess called that was equally to blame for that first goal. Absolute dog shit way to start the match considering they only scored one more and we had plenty of chances. Can‚Äôt say we deserved a draw, but if we take out that 20 second sequence, and ended up losing 1-0 I think we‚Äôd sit here saying it‚Äôs unlucky we didn‚Äôt get a draw.

Still piss poor all around for the most part. How we can‚Äôt start games especially games like that one at home on the front foot is beyond me and probably deserves some answers from Conte. I think he‚Äôs a quality manager and want to see him get at least the rest of this season and next regardless of how this one ends up, because I think he deserves time, but the mental preparedness seemed like it was supposed to be one of his strengths; but our terrible starts are certainly a mental issue.","Don't even know what to say at this point, there are about 100 things I could rant about right now  
  
Yes Conte is an issue, the system is not working. We don't have the players for it, even if we did I don't know if it would fix things. We look lost and can't get any consistency, today we didn't even play well the second half like we sometimes do  
  
Obviously the problem is partially lack of investment/squad turnover so you have to blame Levy too, and he has a pattern of running the club terribly. No squad turnover with Pochettino, no turnover with Mourinho, no turnover with Nuno (lol), now no turnover with Conte. Investment is consistently in the wrong areas, emphasis on the wrong players, no clear system we want to deal with. With Mourinho and Conte we've had a team of offensive players who are stifled with a defense-first system, which Levy would have known about. So why haven't we changed the squad? It's been over three years since Pochettino was gone. What is going on?  
  
If you get rid of Conte we're going to do this all over again before too long. Conte should probably go, yes, but Levy also needs to go. Lewis isn't handing him billions to splash in the market but he's not allocating what he does have to spend reasonably.  
  
Right now I'm tired of supporting this club. I feel like there's nothing to look forward to in our games. I don't just want Conte gone, the whole club needs restructuring. Won't oppose ENIC out, won't oppose Conte out, burn it all down and get the change we've needed for years now  
  
If we hire Pochettino do you think we're going to change the squad significantly? I'm not surprised if Levy believes hiring Pochettino means we get back to 2015 and everything will magically work out again. I've seen nothing to suggest that Levy knows how to plan the football side of things, how to hire a good manager, how to allocate funds to get that manager's squad. Blame Paratici too if you want, I don't care.",League 1,"You are absolutely right -- replace De Zerbi with De Jones in the previous post.

Hopefully this performance gives a bunch of guys (honestly including Conte) a wake-up call that the performances have been incredibly poor thus far even though we're still unbeaten. Absolutely nothing wrong with being able to pull points when you're not at your best, but arguably the only game we actually deserved our result was the opener and that is as much a commentary on Southampton's performance that day as it is ours.","Loved that we won, but it papered over some big cracks again.

If we move on, it's time to go crazy. Sell Kane. Sell Son. Find an attacking, glory-minded manager that wants to roll up his sleeves for a rebuild and back him. We have a very good core of young talent to build around.

We hire them like we are Chelsea but we can't spend like we are Chelsea so we need a consistent system that works even if there are managerial changes because we can't fund entire system changes.,"Really like the current set up of Davies / Richarlison on left and a tucked in Emerson in RWB , solves so many of our defensive issues , despite loss of betancour.
The good teams would overload the left side of our defence whether it was Perisic / sessognon ( not great defensively) and Son who dropped back mostly to be an outlet option to start a counter . With Davies defensively solid and Richie being a better pressed higher up the pitch than Son , we are not ‚Äú sitting back ‚Äú as much as previously and therefore winning possession higher up the pitch .   
Emerson tucking in is a freakin revelation, we have always had issues of our midfield 2 being outnumbered by opposing teams , Emerson is athletic and fast enough to cover the ball if played out wide and Romero solid enough to plug the gap left when Royale advance further upfield ( we are semi screwed if both Romero and Emerson are both too high positionally against a fast winger ) . Royale playing more inside gives kulusevski more width to run to the touchline pulling defenders with him and opening passing lanes ..   
this is thinking football in practice , if this team holds this set up , we are looking to fill 3 positions with elite players over the summer , GK , CB & LCB , ( we still have lo celso and Ndombele on the books )","Kane at CB, Emerson up front, and the league is ours for the taking.","Why why why why are we so fucking inconsistent? I know it‚Äôs easy to blame conte but how infuriating must it be watching several players drop arguably their worst performance of the season a week after beating city? Conte said, we defend like a relegation team. Is it contes fault that dier is always so flat footed and doesn‚Äôt step up to make a tackle in a 1v1? Or that perisic is putting our defence under unnecessary pressure with poor backpasses? 

Fuck sake, coys but this season has got to be one of the most annoying in ages. No outstanding team this season (apart from Arsenal but even they don‚Äôt look that good), we could have been in for an outside shot at the title if sons form hadn‚Äôt fallen off a cliff and our defence and keeper hadn‚Äôt been in a ‚Äúno u‚Äù competition over who can make more blunders.","People can claim Conte is the right man all they want. 

But at least explain how we have a dog shit defense - yet he sets the team out to do nothing but defend for 90 minutes... Playing to our weaknesses. Even against the weakest teams in the league. 

And how he stubbornly refuses to change the system - even when chasing a game - he brings on Richarlison, but then orders Deki to play as a wingback and Richarlison as a winger instead of switching to a back four and playing Richarlison up top. 

And how he refuses to see that Son has offered fuck all, all season yet refuses to sub him or change the system to get the best out of him. 

And how he stopped Kane from dropping deep like he was last season, threading through balls to Son - a tactic which worked wonders the two seasons prior... Once again, failing to play to our strengths and use our best assets. 

And how he refused to allow the club to sign a creative midfielder despite creativity being a blatent issue. 

I've said it for a while now, and I'll continue to say it - he's a great coach under a very specific set of circumstances - but he doesn't fit spurs.... We need someone who will play to our strengths rather than our weaknesses and someone who isn't too stubborn to adapt to a changing game.

- If you are referring to our position in the table, to say, oh look, we're doing good. You don't know what you're talking about either. Our performances will average out over the season.
- This club maybe cursed. Anytime we start going up, we inevitably go down. Feels like a repeat of last to last season when we were at the top.
- The only saving grace will be the world cup break and the January window.
- We need some creativity and passing, the only player in our squad that can do that is Kane.

Sess was tied with Davinson for the worst performances, so many loose touches and did nothing up front will getting danced around behind himself. I was surprised he was left on the full 90 

I‚Äôm the biggest Skipp advocator, but my god I don‚Äôt think he works in a 3 midfield. I‚Äôm willing to be proven wrong but I felt he did nothing going forward.

On we go.",Okay now chelsea is in my hate list. Possibly greater than arsenal,Every time we lose the fans start calling for Hojberg‚Äôs and Royal‚Äôs head. Royal was rough today but Hojberg has a good game. Our offense was horrid. Kane is scoring to start the year but he looks completely lost most of the time. There was no link up play at all up top. Today is on Conte. Got to find a better way to utilize what we have. He got what he wanted and now it‚Äôs on him to actualize it,"Conte has to be blamed here, the only two tactical switches he made were swapping Bissouma and Hoj, and later bringing on Son. 5 subs available and you only bring Richarlison with 15 mins to go?

The fact is that 2 men midfields are outdated, and we see it less and less as the years go by. Red card or not, we were 2nd best and deservedly losing up until that point. Perhaps I ask too much of our squad, but I think we have a really good team, and I do think a midfield of bissouma, hojbjerg and bentancur seems extremely strong.

Great work from the young guys Gil and Sarr hope they can continue we need them at those positions. And great to see Kane and Son get back to their scoring ways.

The moment Royal was taken off and Lucas, Dier, Sess were on that side, they were crossing decent, making runs, and creating chances. And Sanchez. Can't defend. Cant play ball.

Deki Emerson Son Kane are all here now,Bloody hell. That's it. That's the comment.,The chaos is strong. 100% against winter world cup but fucking hell we need a break.,"The tepid first-half performance enabled Forest to win that game. They were always going to have chances and they delivered on a few they did have whilst we created... fuck all.


Harry Kane was a disgrace that first-half, rarely got involved with the centre-half to pull and drag him, was woeful in the press, and genuinely half-assed it. Sanchez has to go now and Skipp is wasted on the right-side of that midfield; all endeavour, no product. Sess was at fault for the second: not putting enough in to cause a trip for a yellow yellow, 5 seconds too late of tracking back, and no pressure on the cross: it‚Äôs just not good enough. He couldn‚Äôt run for the last 10, but that man really is not good enough.


Is there really no other formation we can play other than 3-5-2 or 3-4-3? It‚Äôs mind-boggling. I don‚Äôt even get the personnel on the pitch with six defensive-minded players. Thank god Spence came on to stick it to Conte with his useless comment about ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose‚Äù whilst seeing Emerson be at fault for losses against Arsenal and Sporting, whilst genuinely being rubbish most of the time. Spence drew a yellow and had our best chance. Forster and Lenglet did well, and Bissouma huffed, albeit no puff.


I don‚Äôt know what agenda Conte has to an attacking team, or are our players that bad?",,"Surely the team is reserving energy for second half, the logic is non-existent. We should go all out on both halves and put on fresh pair of legs when needed given our depth.","I‚Äôm calling it, that bentancur goal saved us this season and saved conte too.",Put Perisic as a left forward instead of Son for one game to see how it will go.

See his jeeing up of the crowd? Bosh,"Multiple players were very clearly far from their best today. Yet we only saw one 1 sub out of 5. Make it make sense. Kulusevski was so obviously needed so much sooner, I would have started him personally. A change in midfield was also crying out. Problem is our 4 CM‚Äôs are very similar players. The midfield today did not contribute anywhere near enough to our attacks, they sat very far back and as a result we lacked manpower in the box to convert some of the good chances we had. 

Really poor of us to concede twice in injury time too. Such a disappointing game","Another uninspiring performance but it's not a loss, I'm not crying yet.",[deleted],"Why are people so upset that we suggest an in form player starts over one that is off? I get that he is a golden boot winner but no one player (maybe except Kane, Hugo and Dier) should be guaranteed to start.

I am all for giving him a run of games for him to find form. Fine. But what's the limit?

Richarlison looks good whenever he played. Kulu also played much better than Son.

I would imagine play time is awarded based on merit. Also, Son will have his chances when our fixture piles up. If he is world class as all of us believe, he should be able to come off the bench and make an impact.

We are all on the same team here, but this cult-like behavior is seriously irrational.",We gotta figure out how to get richarlison on the pitch for most of the game. Somethings gonna have to give. He‚Äôs too good and brings to much energy to come on for just 20 minutes.,Hojbjerg is my KING wow i can‚Äôt believe there are fans that dislike his play
226,"Honestly, just numb. Just gonna see Arsenal leapfrog us furthrr and further while 90% of the ""fans"" here jerk off Levy and say we are doing fine. It's just dire.

Maybe we should try a good manager for a change","Such a lackluster game I turned it off after 2-0. We have so many problems I don't know where to start. We need a total rebuild with a project manager but risk losing all our marquee signings if/when Conte walks. We really effed up by not hiring G. Potter when he was likely available and I don't think Poch is a solution. We need a flexible, tactically astute coach who knows the PL & can play multiple formations. We should have a goal of constant squad turnover for next 5+ years so we can inject youth/pace back into our lethargic squad. It's time to let Harry/Sonny go if it gets us a fresh start. Whatever happens, we as fans are in for a world of pain. Scouting/recruitment/academy have got to be fixed.","Son has been a shadow of his former self all season. Can‚Äôt blame the system when he got the golden boot playing the same role last season, or his touches, decision making, shooting and dribling being subpar. He looks tired, low on confidence and less happy, and perhaps Brazils #9 (who cost us 60 mill) could actually provide something more given its not a 15 minute cameo.",,I hop conte finally realises this Bryan Gil kid is pretty good after all,Davison has always been so good for our defense I don‚Äôt know why we don‚Äôt start him,I get the band back together once a year in an FM save just to remind myself üò¢,Are they still alive??????????,These mfs really are going to kill me,Okay now here me out.

I thought that record couldn't be done.  What a comeback to form,"We‚Äôre honestly so boring to watch , we play awful football and look so disjointed.

This was a proper surprise finger in the butt type experience. I don't want to hear about it again and please let's be better prepared next time.,Conte is going to point to this game as one where we need more players and that may be true but I‚Äôll still stand behind my take that this team has looked lazy the past two games.

But keep lying to yourselves.","Big ups to big man Big Dav.

227,Whilst Arsenal are fighting back and showing heart. We crumble once again. This is miserable.,"I actually can‚Äôt believe it, for the first time ever I am actually speechless",Yo our boy Daniel Levy looking more and more like Dr Evil. I swear I just saw him with his pinky on the corner of his mouth,"I can't describe myself as a football fan, I'm just a Tottenham fan who occasionally watches other teams when it has consequences for spurs, so I know next to nothing about Conte and his coaching style other than what I've seen of him with us. 

He strikes me as the type to do everything based on the objective evidence, fan opinion be damned. He absolutely knows he could make tweaks to his system to keep the Kane/Son magic alive, he did it last season when we didn't have the personnel to rigidly stick to Conte ball. 

This season he seems to have decided that while our roster isn't quite there yet for his system, it's close enough that sticking to it more rigidly will give us better results than compromising. And it's not easy to argue. 

As unpleasant as it has been to watch, WBs cross to Kane and inshallah while effectively playing last season's golden boot winner out of position as a mediocre midfielder has us in 4th. This time last season when Kane and Son were seemingly scoring at will, we were in 8th place with a -1 GD. Conte had already been at the helm for 3 months at that point so it can't all be chalked up to Nunoball.

Watching the best attacking partnership in the league's history be nullified seemingly by the manager's design and playing defensive football with one of the league's most porous backlines is frustrating as hell, but by any metric other than 'I enjoy watching my team play' (a pretty bloody important metric tbf), we are objectively in a far better position than this time last season. 

Hell, the only reason our GD feels so bad this season is because last season Kane and Son somehow found an even higher gear to close out the season and Romero, Bentancur and Deki hit the ground running as the best option in their positions. We went from -1 GD to +29 in the last 12 match weeks. 

People seem to think we'd be winning the league if Conte had left Kane and Son to keep working their magic, but it seems just as likely that instead we'd be looking at the two of them competing for the Golden boot amongst themselves while the team itself is miles from a CL spot.

Hopefully the recent results without him at the helm serve as a wake up call to Conte that the roster isn't where it needs to be yet for us to so doggedly stick to his system, and we get a little bit of the best of both worlds to close out the season like last year.","Hojbjerg back to his usual, useless self.

Back 3 that wouldn't even start in the Championship.

Manager refuses to make any changes until it's clearly far too late.","I think this is the last we see of Conte. Idk how Conte lasts if we lose to Fulham. Levy will now have a Poch, Jose and Conte all leave without winning something.

Idk how half the fanbase still defends him. It's criminal. Fucking criminal","Nah I refuse to not just complain about the way we play, just because we wake up in the 2nd half. This is atrocious. A few signings won‚Äôt solve the problem. Contes system just doesn‚Äôt transfer well to the modern day Premier League. Just look at the screen and watch how our players are positioned in different situations, it‚Äôs really bad. 

I have no trust in Antonio and his system tbh, but more importantly, we need new investors,owners etc., ENIC has to fuck off. Qatar, China, US‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt care.","How do you even fix this??

Also Emerson again with 90 mins? Bro, I don‚Äôt know what to say anymore. We have two very good options for the midfield on the bench, no fucking change. Are they here to get money, train a bit and chill? We wanted Bryan Gil, yeah not a good idea yet. 

Frankfurt isn‚Äôt good, they are midtable Team in a far worse league compared to the PL. They were much better in the 2nd half than us, that isn‚Äôt acceptable.

It's a disgrace and I can't keep supporting this type of football if this is what keeps happening. We'll get slapped by Arsenal if this shit continues. 

Something needs to change. I'm not saying Conte needs to go, but either the Club spend way more than they ever have to get Conte who he wants to play the way that he wants (Levy will never do this), or Conte needs to adapt and change his style of play to fit the personnel he has (it looks like he's too stubborn to do so).

Conte should definitely not be sacked, I'm not saying that, he should be given much more time and money, but we really should do better. Bissouma and Lenglet have been disappointing. Son has been off this season and with Kulu out his on-ball flaws have been magnified. Dier has been awful this week. I dream that one day we will finally offload Sanchez. Hugo has been very inconsistent this season. Shoutout to Bentancur and Kane. Even the slightest of pressing and our entire team start panicking and falters. Very annoying how its the same issue despite many managerial changes. All teams have to do is pressure our backline and its over for us. On to the next one, sadly.","poor performance. 
shocking var decision.

That's the losing 2-0 to Wolves, 3-2 to Southampton, 2-1 to Mura Spurs that were out there in the second half. Handed the game to them, inexcusable.",Perisic and Son need the space to get away from each other.

Maintain 90% possession but still be breaking forwards at pace on the break all the time too.  Then slag Hojbjerg off for a misplaced pass under pressure.**

Thanks,"Spurs gon spurs. Gonna choose to think/hope there is a silver lining of jolting the squad into realizing that results are not guaranteed and that performance needs to improve. If we continue to create few chances, and squander the few chances we do manage to create we will drop points.

I'm baffled by the attacking group, Emerson & Perisic both provided decent service a few times and there weren't any Spurs attacker near the box or attacking either post, very odd. If I was a wingback today i'd be livid no one bothered to gamble on a cross coming.","Something to note... Neither PEH or Bissouma were trying to switch the ball at all. There were ZERO diagonal balls played from midfield to stretch their defense. We allowed them to stay compact all match, and suffered without Bentancur. Hopefully people will realize his value now. Far too many underrating him still....","Was there, can assure you it was the app, not the atmosphere. Place was so loud!","Maybe not popular but Sanchez was MoTM for me. 

He handled everything really well and even played a couple of forward passes that were excellent, loved his performance.

Stellini managing and Davies at LWB...Rest of the season please!",Damn good memories right there,"I just don‚Äôt get how you can watch that match and conclude Porro is the problem. We bought him knowing that he‚Äôs not a great defender with the intention to have Romero cover for him. The four behind him were so awful that he couldn‚Äôt do his job. And he also started opposite Perisic, who also can‚Äôt defend against a team trying to get on behind. He was, without a doubt, set up to fail.

Despite those I‚Äôm not sure that he primarily responsible for any of the goals and he frequently showed his quality on the ball.

I would be open to backing Conte if he would explicitly commit his future to us for a multi-season rebuild, but this is not the case. His contract is running out, and it leaves us in a limbo. Should we invest in him and spend money on the players he need this window but risk him running out on us later on, leaving us with players that the next manager may not need? Conte is touted as our win now manager, while I don't expect to immediately win something, but I do expect that the team perform like contenders not whatever today was.

Really not sure what the future holds. We are long due a rebuild, but we have a manager who never commits himself to any club for more than 3 seasons. I wish I could say we should back Conte like Arse did with Arteta for 3 seasons without CL football, but I can't without wondering if the investment spent on him would better serve an actual rebuild with a manager who would stick by us through thick and thin.","Don't forget that Spurs has broken all of us. You may claim it hasn't broken you, but you have to think about it in context of how we used to be.

Defence is not good enough to inspire confidence. That nervousness in the backline affects the entire team.

Despite all of that, pretty happy with the position we are in. There are glaring issued to be solved for sure but lots of positives to be taken.","Embarrassing from the team that took the field today but the reality is that beyond 12-14 players we are bang average. The likes of Sessegnon, Sanchez, Richarlison, Skipp, Royal, Bryan, Lenglet aren‚Äôt up to the standard for which we are trying to compete. Would any of them get any other top 6 team?

Tactics were solid, we looked the more likely to score for long stretches of the match, just ended up with zero on target because of some bad errors when we got in those prime scoring chances. Unlike usual we had no trouble breaking them down but it was the touches in the box and the strikes that let us down today. A better cross by Son and slightly more focus from Kane and we would've had this locked up by halftime.

5. Sons really worrying me with his performances, its not the fact that hes playing poorly so far its the fact that he looks so slow and that he's lot 2-3 yards of pace. Bizarre!

6. Bissouma is leaving a lot to be desired for me, hes far too lethargic in his play, you can tell if he had the right attitude he could go up 2-3 gears(Why is this only the case now hes at spurs)

7. How many injuries can one club get? Whats going on as this is not normal? Other teams get an injury or two we can't string a single consistent 11 without an injury after 2 games.

Theres been something rotten for a long time at spurs and its obvious its a combo of things coming together, poor player purchase, those players making poor decisions in games cascading into mistake ridden plays that lose control of a match and/or concede a stupid goal.

We need to cut a good chunk of the old guard at this stage in my eyes, especially ones that have consistently messed up.

You could see his class. He clearly stands out in his calmness and elegance on the ball, just how a player that came from Barcelona and is used to playing for titles and UCLs every season should play.

A mediocre team from the previous season just going on a flukey run which defies logic and sense, a rogue wave. Everyone else struggling to maintain a run of form and/or fitness. All the big calls go one way and it feels like its a foregone conclusion. Goalkeeper playing out of his skin and above his level every game. A complete aberration.

Richarlison should be given a few starts now. Son is not the player we know him to be, not right now.","I love the way our game changes when Richy comes on. Brings so much energy and dynamism to our attack, like Lucas with a final touch. The goals will come soon enough. 

On the other hand, the last two matches have shown that a Bentancur-PEH midfield can make a tackle but can‚Äôt connect to our front 3. Other sides are finding it too easy to close us down on the wings and we don‚Äôt have a midfield outlet that can continue momentum. We need to change something there.",[deleted]

Great performance against a team with the ref doing everything he could for them!! 

Another game without Conte - another win and clean sheet. Point proven.",Boner Patrol in!,"I feel like a lot of our problems are due to the fact that we have so many players who do barely enough to not stand out in a bad way until it's too late. Lucas, Dier Tanganga, Davies and Sanchez are the worst here. They are (or were) not bad enough to warrant an immediate improvement, so we carried them along until they didn't suit a team with CL ambitions anymore. I feel like Lloris, Sess and Perisic will be next. Sure, they have their moments and some of them are big names, so it's only natural that they are not first on the list to be replaced, but a German saying goes ""The opposite of good is good enough"" and I feel like our club is full of ""good enough"" players. Every once in a while, there are players like Emerson who appear to be so shit that their position becomes a transfer priority, but most of our players don't warrant an immediate replacement. Combine that with Daniel Levy's minimal willingness to spend on transfers and you have a recipe for constant squad deterioration.","To sum it up, poor decision making going forward, defensive errors, mediocre goalkeeping and Riyad Mahrez.

Hurts losing this one a little less because its City Away and there were signs of why we need Bentancur back so much. And the other thing too","I‚Äôll say it louder‚Ä¶ LEVY AND ENIC OUT. 

Who the fuck wants a billion pound stadium when you play like a league one team inside of it? Who wants a successful, trophy-winning coach if you‚Äôre not going to back them properly in the transfer market. The only reason Conte won‚Äôt work here is because of our owners and their ridiculous transfer strategies. Yes Conte is inflexible and stubborn but his trophy cabinet speaks for itself. We all knew who Conte was and how he works when we signed him. You sign Conte, you spend a shit load on his players and he wins you a trophy. Oh no no no, not at Spurs my friend‚Ä¶ you want Bastoni? How about Lenglet on loan? Need a new RWB? Here, have a promising young player that will sit on the bench and add nothing to our starting 11! A creative centre mid? How about 47 defensive midfielders??

I was pissed off at how we declined under Poch because of minimal backing, only to then sack him. The man that literally transformed our club. 5 years later and ZERO improvement on the pitch, in fact we‚Äôre regressing, and people still back these clowns. Someone tell that bald wanker and fat fuck on his yacht that you could actually make more my by being ambitious and winning things.","Don't let the loss affect you guys.

Any news on Sonny yet?",Damn it I missed a great game,"As I maintain, we need a refreshment of the squad asapppppppp. Everyone's piling on Conte and tactics, but the same shit has happened under all of our previous recent managers. Now we're seeing our better players giving up and looking disinterested, because they know there's no quality around them. Someone tell me what shape and changes we can realistically make to perform better, with the limitations of these players?

Could've been a different game. Glimmers of hope with Doherty and Skipp returning - onto the next.",They worked much better in the 3-5-2.,"Real quality and athleticism from Sess. Got a little sloppy for a phase towards the end, but probably only because he'd run himself into the ground by that point.

This club is well positioned for the future and faces no existential risks. Not something that can be said for many parts of its history. It‚Äôs financially stable and sound and not in the teat of an unpredictable middle eastern or Russian owner nor is it over leveraged and financially vulnerable.

The team always has areas to invest to improve areas as nothing is ever complete. But literally almost every transfer window I can remember over the past 25yrs of ST holding I can remember angst and annoyance about weaknesses the fans don‚Äôt see being addressed. Even under Poch.

It would probably work wonders in Serie A but it just doesnt work here. 

We dont have the WBs or defenders to make it work. Chelsea did and the prem was different then. We finished 2nd ffs (albiet WHL was a damn fortress then)

We need to adapt to the players we have either by getting in someone else or sign new ones and fast. And Levy and the board need to make that decision sooner rather than later. 

Because this. This is fucking miserable.","Every time we play a decent team this season we are getting absolutely exposed at every department. 

Sure Hugo made a howler this game but honestly if that didn't happen, we probably would have lost too. 

Our CB looks so sloppy and tentative. Mind you we are playing 3 at the back but all of the tackles have been late and sloppy. Gave a ton of free kicks right outside the box.

Wingback, I think the 2 positions Sess found himself in and hit the first Arse defender with the cross in the first 15 minutes of the game should be indicting the Conte's system in itself. We just don't have the quality in the wingbacks to make 3-4-3 works. Doherty is a hit and miss and doesn't show up for big games either. Perisic might have worked better but no idea why Conte benched him after decent performance at Palace.

Midfield - we got absolutely dominated through and through. PEH and Pape outnumbered and outplayed. 

Attack - it was probably too much of an ask for Deki to come up against Arse and make everything work right after his injury. He had decent spells but last balls failed him. Son needs and extended spell at the bench, nothing is working for him at this moment, can't get even basic touches and passes right.",just beat man city 2x please! ;),"Never had to clench, Fulham werent dangerous for the last hour",,Are we going to loan Bryan after this match?

KMJ, Milenkovic, Boatman anyone would have provided sth and no one can change my mind otherwise. We failed to get proper RB/RWB too even when we knew it was our priority. Why did this team even waste $ for Spence when he isn't even getting chances? Same thing goes for Sarr, Gil, and probably Udogie. Spence+Sarr+Gil worth almost 60m. Sometimes it's so hard to follow how this team operates, since other big teams buy players to actually play them but this team wastes 10~20m to u21 players and send them for a loan to eventually let go like Clarke. At this point I don't even ask Kane to sign his contract anymore. He deserves better squad than this.",,"To be fair, we're doing quite well, considering that for some reason our opponents seem to be allowed to play *two* halves of football every match.","Literally every player who spent at least half a minute out wide on the right put in a better cross than Emerson.

Including for both of their goals. 

Utd pressed high up the pitch, which should suit our style, but when you can find a teammate with even the most simple of passes, you‚Äôre going to get dominated. 

This should have been a game of multiple chances for us, the way Utd set up, but we totally shat the bed. Is it tiredness? Or just players not of a good enough standard? I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs a mixture of both. To play the way Conte wants us to play, you can‚Äôt have multiple players having bad games like that.

Arsenal will run out of gas, or even normal injuries will throw them off track. City depends on Haaland performing this way now. They are at as much risk as us to lose form.

Bellingham has skyrocketed since then and I haven't watched enough of Camavinga but I do know he's developed well. 

We have a proper gem in Pape Sarr if we develop him right.

Any team scoring goals or winning games this week are disrespectful, uncouth cads.","Very weak performance but holy shit this match thread is extremely toxic and reactionary. Won't say much else other than that it's normal to have weaker performances over the course of the season, what sets most good teams from bad teams apart is winning when the performances are poor as well. Of course, you can point out to Man City and the likes that casually dismiss teams by ridiculous margins but even they have moments over the course of a season when they play like shite, they just are capable of getting the points in spite of that. So far we have 11 points out of 15 with moderately difficult fixtures and not very good gameplay and I think that is encouraging.

Now on to the actual game... won't say much about the refereeing as that on par for the course to what standard EPL refereeing is like. I just want to comment on the casual way we switched off in the 2nd half and simply conceded all the initiative to West Ham. That goal was an absolute clown fiesta and was a reminder of peak Spursy gameplay from late 2019 till early 2022. Sanchez played like his old shaky self, unfortunate that the record is gone but it's been deserved based on his performance today. Bissouma was a non-factor for most of the game, I can see why Conte has been reluctant to give him many minutes, he doesn't look to be ready yet (or maybe Hojberg is not the right partner for him, who also had a pretty bad game to be fair). Son is not finding himself, he needs to be benched for the next 2 games and have him back for the City fixture. Richarlison is extremely good and I'm so delighted to have him in our team.

Conte not making subs was weird af. Can slightly understand him trying to stick to his guns but now we have great depth and he hasn't made any use of it. In any case, 1 point is good. On to the next match!",He's an absolute cracker,"I know it's annoying to bitch after another 3 points, but shit our tactics kinda suck sometimes. Willingly play with no midfield and continue to trot out the same duo game in and game out. Overly defensive with zero press and reliance to capitalize on mistakes instead of forcing the other team into mistakes. CBs and midfield do nothing but play hoofball. Deki is the only attacking option from the right and Perisic is the only from the left. We sacrifice the midfield to overwhelm on the outside, but only one of our wingbacks is actually capable of capitalizing on that style of play. I know Conte is a control freak with his ""patterns"", but there's very little creativity in our attack. It's not Nunoball or Mou-ball, but it's not that far off and it gets pretty annoying to watch.  I don't expect every game to be a dominant performance, but I do expect something more than this.

But fuck it I guess. 3 is 3.","Awful awful first half, able to get the goal without making changes though. I'd be starting Richardson with Son on the bench. Son been a mess have him come off the bench to run in behind",Bench Romero from now on. Can‚Äôt be getting turned that easily.

Conte is known for not caring about cups. This would be the game to get our secondary players some time on the pitch. I think this shows more than anything how much we depend on our top 7-8 players to get results at all. We are a top-table team mixed with a bottom-table team. We need so much more quality to deserve our performance and table/cl position, and not depend so heavily on kane/son/kulu/benta/peh/rich/romero to carry every single game all the time in order for us not to be at bet a mid-table team. All teams depend on their top players, but most top-level teams have a lesser discrepancy between top and bottom level on the squad.",,"Not a bad performance, but shows what we need to do to make that step up to the proper elite. First off, as much as I love then and thank the immense service and value theyve brought to the club, dier and lloris have to be replaced by world class players.

Also annoying that we're going to have to deal with a lot of bad takes about how Conte doesn't know how to coach this team or how Arsenal dominated when, until the Lloris mistake/red, the game was going how we would have wanted.

I'm certainly not going to watch it now,"I‚Äôve said it basically every week but we are so fucking dickless it is scary. Hugo deciding two changers a game is good.

Daniel Levy. Get out of our club.","Anybody who says today was Conte's fault just doesn't want to slate the players. The tactics didn't make Lloris drop the easiest shot of the season to collect. Nor did the tactics made Son miss every decent pass, one of which led to the second goal.

The fact is half of the team is playing like they were chosen from a raffle and the other half is trying their best to drag the other half.

Emerson, Lloris , Dier , hell even Son have produced awful performances, but were dragged to a decent position by the others.","Been saying since last season that he has the profile of a player that can massively pop with a bit of confidence.

He gets into fantastic positions, has the skill to carry the ball, is a physical beast, excellent defensively, reads the game like a book, and gives it his absolute all on the pitch and apparently in training too. Just can't cross and fucks up the last pass over and over again. 

Maybe he doesn't have the passing/crossing ability in him. There are many players though who get a bit of confidence and their composure improves dramatically and with it their final ball, just like forwards and finishing.

In isolation isn't something that doesn't happen all the time, but in the aggregate it seems like it always stalls us.",We were really shit but I'm not so disappointed that we lost rather than disappointed that we didn't look like scoring at all.

We haven't even had a cupcake schedule either like the Arsenal scum have.

We're still a work in progress and let's hope for good moves in January.

Bright side of life, where would we be without our Juve rejects? All respect in the world to Kane, but Kulu has shown to be our most important (and potentially best?) player. Dude constantly brings it. Fits Conte's system perfectly (unlike Son, which seems to be a work in progress).

Can‚Äôt keep watching this train wreck.,,Won the second half for all I care,Corner FC here we go!!!!,"I'm not going to read any comments here. We didn't play poorly on the whole.

Lloris on the first goal was fouled. If he was an attacker and Wilson was the keeper that's a penalty and sending off. Having said that, if he played on he could have put pressure on the shot. Same for Dier who could have gotten on the goal line and stopped it.

The second goal.. terrible ball out, Sessegnon did the best he could in a bad situation. Lenglet showed him outside, not much he could do with Almiron going full speed at him.

I wish Doherty and Perisic had started. I just don't feel optimistic when Sessegnon and Royal have the ball in the final third.

I thought Bentancur looked good. Bissouma not as much; I wish Skipp had stayed on instead of him but maybe he's not ready for 90?

Lucas looked fine off the bench but we didn't get as many chances as we needed to equalize.

Give up chances like that and you deserve to lose, simple as, but it's disappointing that a better performance will get buried until a bad result.","That VAR decision hurt. When Kane scored that last-minute goal, I got flashbacks to Stevie B‚Äôs goals against Leicester last season.

I think he should reconsider his tactics, this team deserves way more than what they‚Äôre showing on the field.","- Richarlison should have started. I love Son, but he is out of form (not that Kulu did much better today) 

- Spence should have come on for Royal 

- Sarr (or Skipp) should have come on for one of the midfielders. Either really. They were both mediocre today

- Today really showed that we need a creative midfielder who can get the ball from the wingbacks and do something with it other than pass it back to the defense.

Ultimately  can't complain because we didn't do enough to win it outright. Dier fluffed a hattrick of chances, Sat back scared and timid the first 45' and lucky not to ship another 1-2 goals. Gil probably moves ahead of Moura after tonight, kid can dribble like Moura but much better passing and game IQ. 

Something has to change, i can't continue to watch us sit back and cycle the ball between CB's for 7,8,9 passes before moving it to the wingbacks who then pass it directly back to the opposition. Our play style is dross, unambitious and will not get results if it continues this way. Teams at the top level can play when they're invited to play and move the ball around. 

We can't continue to play scared against every single team that we face, without Deki and/or Richarlson I don't see us getting any positive result against Marseille. We'll sit back and they'll attack in waves until we're down 2-3 goals and drop out into Europa.",How is our passing out the back so bad?,,AND HES OUT FOR BLOOD,"Things I noticed in the game - 

1. Lloris and Emerson lost us the game. Before each of their individual mistakes, the game was pretty even.
2. Emerson pretty much destroyed his case to be the starting RWB today, and Doherty didn't help his case either.
3. I get the reasoning behind the 3-4-3, have two runners who could wreck havoc behind the Arsenal Highline, and till the red card it did. But 3-4-3 is also a time bomb which was supposed to fail us eventually.
4. Conte has to try the 3-5-2, at least as a test run, specially now he can't have the defensive presence of Emerson.
5. At least it was nice to see Skipp back in a spurs shirt.",Not his debut. He played against Forest.,that sub has been worse than twitter for quite a few years now.

Why are we using 1 out of 5 subs? Why are we playing backwards all the time? Why aren‚Äôt we able to create something out of possession?

The sub thing pisses me off because we have subs. Sess, Doherty, Sarr, Spence and Skipp. Bissouma had a nightmare of a game and was on a yellow for 70min. He didn‚Äôt do anything for our offense, why don‚Äôt bring on Sarr or Skipp? Skipp is on the bench so he should be fit for 20mins. Also, what is Emerson doing on the pitch when we are desperately need to score? He had a good game defensively but we need a goal. Spence and Doherty are way better offensively. Take a damn risk ffs.

All our decent attacks came over the left side. Perisic and Davies or sometimes Kane. Right side was dead besides of the goal because Emerson is still not good offensively. We need a midfielder that has playmaker abilities. PEH has sometimes a good pass in him but the next 10 go back or way too far. But nah, we are in talks with Dan James, the welsh Lucas with worse dribbling but better stamina. 

I trust in Antonio, but we lack creativity so much and that‚Äôs concerning.",City fans got used to stars on the bench. Hopefully we can get to that point.,What a fucking game that was.

We played away from home against a good opponent, and the ref was absolutely horrid. I don‚Äôt think this will be an awful draw when we look back on it. 

We‚Äôre still 3rd in the league, after this match week, we are still picking up points where we wouldn‚Äôt have last year.

Anyway, our attack should be able to do better. Injuring all 3 forwards really hurt, forcing Conte to play the unsuitable 352. But he has no excuses. He chose to offload our creative midfielders    (e.g. Winks did very well in 352 last year. Lo Celso Ndombele is surely more creative than our def.mid too).

I do believe that the team is at least in a better position than they were at this time last year. Last January we looked like a league one side against Chelsea 3 times and had been knocked out of Europe. The team made it through and finished the year strong, though I had expected MUCH better this season thus far.

Anyway....","We can all accept that there are players in this squad who are not good enough for the level we aspire to be at.

I have faith in you, Beatles man","Overall, I'm not too gutted by this result. 
- It's Arsenal away, we always lose there.
- After Arsenal scored the first one, we fought back. For a bit we played very well.
- We looked dangerous on the counter. I'm sure we could have score some in the second half.
- With Royal having to go for a 3 match ban, this might be a blessing in disguise. Maybe we see Spence brought on as a sub, or even start?
- Royal's Red, while an idiotic challenge in their half, was never a red. We got done by the ref on that one for sure.
- Kane, Son and Richarlison looked decent tbh.
- Arsenal looked very vulnerable. They are playing well for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised to see teams take advantage of their high line and press. 

Let's see. As long as we start our momentum again, we should be fine.","1pt off Scum, tied with City, but they both have a game in hand.","It has to be people baiting or 12 year olds by now, right?",When we use our subs we can be pretty devastating.,"Frustrating game, woeful finishing but the chances were there and spurs looked the better side. Also didn‚Äôt concede late so there‚Äôs that!","Fuck tuchel, if this was anywhere but a football field Conte would‚Äôve kicked his scrawny ass lol",So frustrating to continue to have the same problems not breaking down teams that sit back. Why didn't we buy a creative mid? Wtf,Can we please play 3-5-2,"Said the exact same thing at half. The announcer literally said they should be up 2-0 and they only had one shot on goal, which was from deep!

We need another midfielder, minimum.",We had like 30% possession besides the first 15 minutes in a midfield three and he still gets praised its astonishing,Was the sound messed up on the nbc feed or was the stadium exceptionally quiet today?,Sigh,"Tuchel should have had a red when he did his little sideline jaunt, which happened during the actual game.",[deleted],"So many points being made that I strongly agree with and so many I strongly disagree with. 

Second half was painful, but we probably would have lost that game last season. Just happy we held on for the draw.",I was thinking that the whole time. They clearly haven‚Äôt watched us under Conte play deep an concede possession vs strong opposition. To be fair tho we didn‚Äôt play well. A few of them looked fatigued for sure. System works but it can be stressful sometimes,"First of all, very happy with the win! With that in mind, I don't know if that was all planned tactically, but at large portions of the game, it felt like I was watching the Nottingham Forest show.

I mean... surely thats got to be the reason behind the amount of mistakes players have done this season?,"Another game in which an individual error led to the poor performance.

On a side note, Leicester really are crap aren‚Äôt they?",Blue balls mates.,I actually really like this interview from tuchel,"if this is what it takes for Emerson to finally be dropped, so be it","Because problem I saw was that no one in midfield or backline could bring up the ball and there was not much forward passing or through passes. Especially with Kane now playing more up top. I counted several opportunities that Davies had to shoot a through ball to Son but did not. 

It doesn't even matter if we have world class forwards if we cannot pass the ball to them at all. So frustrating.

We need to get some midfield and backline that can deliver forward, even if risky, passes. Players like Sanchez, Davies, and even Hojbjerg should not start for their respective positions.",Commentary was awful! Might‚Äôve thought we were down 8-0,"What you guys think about Spence situation? Can't believe Conte believes more in Emerson, he improved a lot, but I see a lot of potential in Spence",Our defence is so not as solid as it should be. I like Dier as a person but his defending makes me anxious.,I love Richy so so much. Far better match from the lads. Far quicker and accurate build up makes a massive difference.

I wish we subbed him off for skipp and kept sarr in.,"Credit where credit is due, 4 of the last 5 premier league matches have been clean sheets. That‚Äôs an impressive feat‚Ä¶then there‚Äôs the Leicester match","Right? And Sarr on top of that? Bissouma eventually getting it sorted out? Our midfield 2 is set for a long time. I of course wouldn‚Äôt complain about a more creative player in front of/with them, but as far as that player type goes we are absolutely stacked.","What a basket case of a club. Tail end of last season we looked like absolute worldbeaters who could take on anybody under Conte.

Literally nothing has changed for years now.",Lloris again. Son again. Now Perisic as well.,Hopefully today was peak Arsenal and they just go downhill from here. Outplayed on all parts of the pitch.

What about the rythm of our 4 defenders (Hugo included) to begin possession ?   
What about reaction of litigation on the first goal ? (no rage, injustice feeling, passion).  
What about the offensive (and defensive after all) of Sess and Emerson ?   
  
Not only negatives things, i like the way of Skippy played, Bentancur is a real guy, encouraging about Bissouma, Sanchez showed caracter... But it's globally too soft when we see the entire team on the field, we need more courage/passion/rage and be crazy sometimes whatever happened after...

And the poor refereeing. I'll take the draw and forget about that abysmal show.,Right. Was it paramount + ? I was like does he have no idea that Conte is content to just sit back and let them dick around? Our attacks were much more dangerous but I suppose some people think possession=control.

Perisic is a baller and disappointed by Bissouma",The US commentator clearly had no idea of Conte‚Äôs style.

The style wasn‚Äôt sustainable.  I said before the season started that I thought this was the deepest Spurs squad I had seen and how excited I was, but there seemed to be a major issue in central midfield.  I was sort of right, but what I never expected was for the attitude and mental strength problems to come booming back.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Spurs will win plenty of games this season and may even string a few convincing passes together in some matches, but this lot ain‚Äôt competing at the top.  Which is fine!  I just got a little carried away because on paper there are a lot of very good players.",Bloody Emerson,"I am truly fuming with this performance let alone the result. 

I cannot believe a world class manager like Conte cannot have a plan B when we can't keep the ball due to a press.

Yes we will probably beat a lot of teams that don't press but we won't make top 4 consistently playing the same style against teams that press high.

Partey probably could have been marked tighter on his goal but they were always going to get space outside the box. Less said about the second goal the better.

We looked a little off it in attack. Richarlison did great to earn the penalty.

Surprised that red was given, surprised VAR didn't take a look, I'm sure we'll appeal. I think it's been given for the reaction. Fairplay to Martinelli, I don't have a problem with his writhing... if the refs are going to reward it, that's on the refs. It's a clumsy challenge but nothing more.

I was really unimpressed with Davies,but he showed up the second half, and, whisper it quietly, Dier looked more assured on the right with him pinging balls and playing quicker short passes.

Please dont extend contract with him.,"This is why you stay positive as a fan. The game thread I saw today was warranted for the first half, but putting trust in Conte pays off. He realized that Emerson wasn‚Äôt working (granted every pass he played was either backwards or to an opposing player), and made the proper switch.

Bentacur has been an absolute revelation to this club and has been an anchor in midfield all season. I thought Moura came on and looked positive throughout the match.

Overall, all credit to Conte for making the right subs (at the right time), and credit to the fans in the stadium for getting behind and staying behind our team.

Any other player in the world would have been hauled off at half time and any sort of post match analysis will boil down to well we couldn't really build anything because Kane was atrocious both on the ball and off the ball. 

Even then we created enough to win this and Emerson should have scored one of his chances but then again, we shouldn't rely on Emerson to score. 

But yea Tottenham away in Europe is just us not being that good even though we started out hot. We are in a weird position where I would love for Conte to start cutting heads off. If you are shit you go off, but then again that could literally mean Kane leaves. He kind of have us by the balls. 

I hate that it's a thing that we can't perform away in Europe, it's such a stupid ""thing"" to have.",Horrific second half,"That‚Äôs the reason why I stay away from the match threads, it‚Äôs full of over emotional fans, and just being in there turns you. I wait for the post match thread when everyone has calmed the fk down. In saying that, I do now feel Son should be benched for the next game. It sends the wrong message to the squad to put an out of form player into the starting line up, 2-3 games I understand but we‚Äôre now 7 games into the season.

Players in the position just don‚Äôt get enough clear chances in the system as it favors crosses, and it‚Äôs not surprising that they struggle, unless the player is someone like prime Hazard who was an elite dribbler.

Break up the monotony,"They certainly had a better plan in the first half and executed it sublimely. However they never seemed all too threatening with the ball. The tactical change was great and gave us energy but I thought it opened us up more and that second goal was far too easy for Chelsea.

Overall, Chelsea looked better than last week but I didn‚Äôt feel like they were world beaters. 

We stole a point, didn‚Äôt deserve it at all. Need to improve vastly and maybe consider something more in the midfield. I thought benta had a better half but then he fizzled in the second half.

We move on.","Shit performance that begets the result, unlike much of this season.   Conte is so fucking rigid and tactically inflexible. Wrong XI to start the match, zero willingness to adapt or change, complete misuse of substitutions.  This squad has played like trash since the season began and no change or improvement is insight as we just continue to get worse. We're a lot closer to things turning very sour instead of turning around. 

And all of that ignores that everyone on the pitch save for Hugo and Deki looked like various degrees of trash today. No touch, no cohesion, minimal effort. Embarrassing from beginning to end, but apparently nearly everyone on the squad was so good they weren't worthy of being taken off.  Bissouma has played 120 minutes this season out of a possible 720.

Richarlison is just not as useful playing the wide 10 role as he is playing striker. Kind of reminds me of Lucas. Both are better when playing away from the sideline.

Kane seemed to have taken a knock to his knee or carried a minor injury into the game. Didn‚Äôt seem to have his usual pace.

You could tell he was much more involved throughout as he was deployed almost as a third midfielder to help break the press.

He will be frustrated he didn't score but he can hold his head high and the naysayers can shut the fuck up.

Conte is too proud to change his approach and we are going to slip down the table unless something changes. Bring in Lucas in the 88th min for I think the third game this season is a joke. 

We were all over them in the last 30 mins but a match is 90 mins. We have to start better and that is on the manager and his ‚Äúsystem‚Äù.

Bissouma was so deep first half we essentially played 6 at the back!

I‚Äôm gonna call it early, Conte out!",Lets be honest. We were terrible but the boys have fought through it. The negativity was definitely deserved but now it‚Äôs all about good vibes man. Still shows there‚Äôs a lot of problems in the squad depth.,fuck pope,This hurts more than the Madrid final,"And I‚Äôm sure conte will change nothing going into the next game, we need an attack minded coach for once, I‚Äôm tired of watching this boring park the bus counter attack play.

Wingbacks doing fuck all. Conte unfortunately for him needs to adapt the system to his personnel. He keeps forcing the same system that we lack the personnel to play. This system places huge emphasis on the wingbacks, who are unable to produce the output needed. 

That said we also lack a distinct playmaker. Our most creative players are Kulusevski and Kane, maybe Perisic. Kulusevski has made the difference more than anyone this season, without him we look absolute shit up front. As much as I like Richarlison someone with the profile of Maddison would have been a much more intelligent signing. Richarlison need service, Maddison creates his own and creates service for others.",they better start perisic next week,Any kid playing FIFA could have done better squad selection and game management than what Conte did out there today. Looking like an absolute clown with his stubbornness.,I am so disappointed in how we played. No sense of urgency after the goal. Bissouma was poor and our play out the back was shocking. Conte has a lot to fix before Saturday,"That was a kid, kids are stupid no need to overreact on it.","Couldn‚Äôt believe you guys sold him but understand you had to shift players for FFP. Clearly gives his all for 3 points and knows how to get inside the oppositions head. Love to have him on your team, hate to play against him.

We move.,"Thoroughly deserved for Arsenal.

Perhaps one could argue that we did enough to deserve a draw in that second half but we took an absolute walloping in the first half. So many mistakes, so many poor touches and crappy giveaways. 

It took so much effort in the first half to get the ball into their box whereas every time they had the ball they just waltzed into our box. 

And you have zero chance whatsoever when your keeper just absolutely gift wraps a goal. Just literally gave them a goal. It wasn't even a shot on target. It was like a hard cross that he just completely, utterly bottled.",Time for a media blackout until the next match.  Cheers!,Reckless challenge? Ffs.

Doherty was horrible",I can see Skipp really excelling in a midfield 3 where he can get more involved in attack.,"Emerson was decent. 

-hides-",Imagine how deadly that right side would be if Royal was worth a shit.,The fact that he even got outta bed for this,,"Just sack Conte already, we lost to this terrible Liverpool side at home, we play the same way every game. This squad is better than the way he‚Äôs using it, he‚Äôs creating a atmosphere where we are scared of everyone instead of them being scared of him 

Conte Out","Great comeback and I‚Äôm on the moon for the win!! 

Bentancur, Hojbjerg, Kane, Perisic, and Sessgnon were all very good. Kane was literally everywhere playing CM, LW & RW 

Conte needs to stop putting 7-8 defensive players, that‚Äôs not our strength! Putting shitty defenders like Sanchez doesn‚Äôt make our defense better, it only kills the offense.","Started the game well. Again individual errors cost us and resulted in losing our collective minds. We just cannot cope with any pressure. The last 15 minutes of the game where we should be bombarding them we decided just to hit low balls/pass straight to them.

Sessegnon needs to be binned as well. He just doe not have the head for where we want to be. If Emerson Royal put in a performance like that he'd be run out of town. 

Bentancur is class. Skipp looked decent enough. But we have too many players who somehow cannot pass.

And Hugo. I love you, but why do you do this to me?",Tbh he looked offside to me,"‚ÄúToothless Tottenham‚Äù

The headlines write themselves",,so much fun,"was hoping for a positive result and remained hopeful until the red card pretty much but cant say its a disaster since we usually lose here like at chelsea. was absolutely fuming during the game though. definitely some bad luck on our side too. gotta say havent been watching arsenal but they seem so much better technically on the ball than us which is sad. also our wingback problem is still a problem. fucking ridiculous. even perisic isnt quite what i envisioned though he occasionally comes out with a great cross. still both him and sessegnon imo far better than emerson whole doherty clearly isnt the future and spence is not really in the picture it seems. just ridiculous. also not sure richy, son and kane works so far. kulu adds something different that helps creatively a lot more and without that our front 3 seem even more isolated without midfielders who are more technically proficient than our current ones / wingbacks that work, especially as kane seems reluctant to be used in a more creative role at the expense of being nearer the box. still need some more GOOD attackers coming in to finally replace lucas and gil. especially more creative ones. also wondered during the game if maybe we shoulda done 3-5-2 for more midfield stability.","Feel bad for the lad, he got a nice ovation but only got to do cardio for 2 minutes on the pitch.",Should probably stay in the lower leagues tbh. Made so many weird decisions and kept killing any flow of the game.,"IMO More importantly is which WB they are paired with. Like Perisic and son sometimes doesn‚Äôt work but putting Sess on the left can unlock different overlapping, and especially with perisic being so two footed. He can overlap with kulu or Richarlison. I like how conte realized this and was confident tweaking it",God this team is screaming out for a creative midfielder it‚Äôs so painful to watch.,"Now that I‚Äôve had a moment to settle down, feels like we need to look at new ways of getting our front three involved. Everyone knows Son/Kane/Kulu are a threat and spend so much effort shutting them down. Felt like they were shutdown so effectively today and until Richy came on our forward threat was pretty minimal.

I think that‚Äôs where our wingbacks need to get involved more. Hoping Conte has ideas going forward for these bigger matches.",I want to see Kane play the 10 in 3-5-2. Sonny is a player who needs good service and he just doesn't have it. Kane moving more forward means that it's Perisic and Emerson putting the passes in. Conte needed to use his subs. Spurs need to be more ruthless with their finishing or else the results won't back the poor performance,We don't have the personnel or tactics to break teams down,Smartest person in the post match thread right here.,"Dude is the best. I am 100% on board. Definifely understand what you all felt now. Hate him if he's an opponent, but if he's one of your players, you can't help but love the guy.",[deleted],He can ping a pass down the left side so well.
286,Bring back Poch,"Our only real chance of a trophy left and we‚Äôve started Davinson Sanchez next to Eric Dier once again. A partnership that has lost to a team sponsored by a scaffolding company. A partnership that wouldn‚Äôt strike fear into a Sunday league side. A partnership that is about as reliable as the straw house from the three little pigs. Son has been the worst player in every game he has started for the last several months. I am exhausted from watching that match, which is more than a few of those players can say because they didn‚Äôt seem to give a single fuck.",Rest in Peace pops,Glad tottenham fans can always find a negative to talk about after a good performance.,I blame Bergwjin for that,Mistakes FC,Lloris needs to fucking go. Massive fucking loser dragging the entire team down.,"Just where do we go from here? Clearly we need investment. The worst of it though, is that Conte and the players just do not look like they care. Is it time we just get a project manager? I genuinely can‚Äôt remember our football being this dreadful in the last decade. 
All parties are at fault, but I have no clue where we go from here.","For the last time. He did not play the same role. If you really think he did, I don‚Äôt know what to say. 
I want Richarlison to be successful and play if that‚Äôs the way for Conte system to do well. But honestly I doubt he can make any difference the way we are playing",,Levy is as pleased as we are tbf.,Yeah. It sucks that those are our two options after romero,Not sure I said those runs tbh,Great result considering we were playing with 10 men. Lucas Moura was fucking dreadful all game,"Seriously, imagine where City would be without Kdb or arse without odegaard, kulu is the same role for spurs",We are one game closer to conte's sacking and 90 mins closer to sweet release of death. Those are 2 really big positives we can take from the match,,Maybe we should try attacking for a whole game. Rather than trying it when 0-2 down. Radical thought I know,"This was the first time in a month or so we looked like we really wanted the win. Ups and downs come, but attitude remains. Really good to see our second half today","We were also up against the Unholy Trifecta: 1) other teams had lost so Spurs had a chance for a big win; 2) Everyone was talking about our home form and 8 games in a row; and 3) Our two fightingest players were both out as was Deki, who‚Äôs strong mentally too.","Let‚Äôs ignore the stupidity for a second behind the 4 minute check because that negates this idea of VAR being for ‚Äúclear and obvious errors‚Äù (and while I think the lines are dubious, it is by the modern rules of football offside since Kane is ahead of the ball when it is played regardless of the inadvertent deflection)

We were dire in the first half and Dier missed 2-3 clear cut chances in the second half‚Ä¶ we need to be way more clinical especially with the way Conte wants us to play. Gil was a fantastic burst of energy, Emerson was the opposite of that and took away our options on the right when he came on. 

Hopefully Deki and Richarlison are close but now we have to play full strength and win away at Marseille‚Ä¶ ffs but anyway coys",I feel like many aren‚Äôt committed rn and have their eyes on the wc especially Romero he was horrid,,Leeeeeerrrooyyyyyy Jenkins!!!!,Damn.

Again. (flair irrelevant),"Yes!! I'm hoping that in the January or next Summer transfer window we swap Moura for another scary option. Then with 5 subs, we'll have 2 threatening and fresh attacking options from the bench",Really would love to see an end to the back line clearing the ball to about 10-15 yards out of the penalty area to the center of the pitch for there to be no Spurs players around because the CMs are back defending deep and the front 3 are somewhere else. Conte loves this formation but I just don‚Äôt think we have the personnel for it.

Look, don‚Äôt touch - it‚Äôs bad enough when they come over here to shitpost.","Lloris, Perisic, Kulu had a good game, I think the rest were pretty poor.

Kulusevski offers a threat everytime he makes an appearance. But still be has to sit and watch with the rest of us.

I hate that the league, us included, are gifting them the title so far and that we have no more say in where they finish. It's mentality that's leading to the mistakes, and not a quick fix, but it's not as bad as it looks and as bad as it looks at the same time.

I don‚Äôt think Poch is as great as most of this sub, but he was 100% correct about when we needed a rebuild. Once Walker and Dembele were out it was never the same. And even if Ndombele would‚Äôve been his replacement, he wasn‚Äôt ready one day one.

but as for what‚Äôs going on specifically right now, my best guess is the World Cup threw everything into chaos, but I really have no idea. These guys were amazing in September and the end of last season.

Our counter-attack from last season is dead! Every time we break we either give it away or just back pass. Kane is hesitant to shoot & Son been poor. 

Defense is very shaky and we were lucky not to concede lots of goals. Romero is never available since he signed (injury or with Argentina) so we can‚Äôt build our defense based on Sanches.",Son did well on that one burst forward but he's really not looking like himself. Running into players and nothing coming off for him just yet. Hopefully he puts it behind him soon.,He will. He always does. It‚Äôs just that his bad form is early this season. Probably better this way to be honest.,"That was a fixture we‚Äôd draw from last season.  Gritted it out, stayed positive, JOBE DONE",He really does put in a good shift doesn't he. Delighted with him so far!
296,Let's start taking it out on the players there performances are just not good enough they are a disgrace.,"Some of these guys get huge money and cant manage a win against a lower team when there is potential for a trophy.

2. Kane is gassed, unfortunately having both Richarlison & Son injured really hurt our ability to even give him 10 minutes off at end of game
3. Romero, Davies, Lenglet, Perisic are all fine, Dier is in one of his bad spells (highlights why we can't depend on him as a constant 1st team starter), yes we need a CB & RWB as soon as possible
4. Agree, starting to look like what we thought we bought, Conte has to use the 3 in middle more often.
5. I think Gil goes on loan (better for him), Spence is either loan or more time.

He saw the runs from Kane/Son in the first half but the passes were just a bit off, Son and Richi also kind of ate each others space up in the first half, give them a bit more game time and the rotation options will be insanely impactful"

Also Kanes passing has fallen off a cliff this season","5 people to blame for that. 1st is Bissouma, got himself booked so early he could no longer make challenges and threw his ability. 2nd Lloris, his inability to play out the back and constantly play us into danger has been present since 2016 and has only gotten worse. 3rd is Sanchez though I might be a bit harsh on him, the guy just does not have the ability to play out the back. 4th is Hojbjerg, the guy should‚Äôve gone off. 5th is Conte, poor tactics and subs.

At least I provided some numbers my guy. Do you have anything to counter? How different is the system from last season when he tied for the golden boot?

He‚Äôs coming back from injury yet due to shortage of attackers, he‚Äôs asked to play 3-5-2 and almost all 90 minutes in a CL ‚Äúfinal game‚Äù. The significance of this is that of course his form isn‚Äôt great yet coming back from injury and his bread and butter isn‚Äôt hold up play because he‚Äôs not built for it, but he has to anyway this game. When he can‚Äôt do this as well as traditional CFs twice his size and weight, people knock him for it. I thought even so, Lucas got the ball to Kane quite a few times, more often than not. If you noticed, many times Spurs didn‚Äôt get forward fast enough so even when Lucas was successful doing this, many times the ball had to be recycled back by Kane or whoever Lucas passed to. This being his role, Lucas didn‚Äôt dribble as much and people are also using this to say he was dreadful.

&#x200B;

I think the lack of rotation and zero form for our squad players hinders us certainly, which is on Conte for not using his squad outside of his preferred starting XI. And also on the squad itself, wingbacks are crucial to the system and we don't have a single in form nailed on wingback in the squad, Perisic & Doherty maybe on his day could be this but neither have even sniffed at the top form that is needed to succeed in this system. CM's pairing is clearly tiring because Yves and Skipp are hardly used.",,"He didn't mean to send off Tuta.

I think Sanchez is valuable to bring off the bench if we're defending a lead but Tangaga is so much more comfortable on the ball and actually wants to get forward. There's was a beautiful move near the end where Doherty cut inside to the box and Tanganga made the overlapping run on the outside to give Kulusevski two passing options that's exactly the type of play Romero provides.,"Fitness plus you can bring Richarlison, Bissouma, one of Perisic/Sess plus two others in.

Or is that only if it‚Äôs outside the box?,fuck matty cash,"You just need to look at stats. Son has not garnered a single assist nor goal when playing with Perisic. His shots taken significantly decline by 70% when playing with Perisic. He got his 3 assists and 5 goals only when Sess played on the left. Even when you look at our formation map/pass map, perisic plays further ahead in position of Son and Son plays more like a wing-back. it is not ideal to use a last year golden-boot winner as a wing back to advance Perisic. if it proved differently, if the stats spoke otherwise, then I would be more than inclined to have perisic and son playing on the left. At the end of the day, stats speak for themselves, and if you are a true fan of football, watching the chemistry difference between Sess+Son vs Per+Son is very noticeable. Today their combination has been the best than it has been before, but still significantly worse than Sess+Son. Before swtiching to 3-5-2, Son had taken 0 shots, whereas in the very previous game against Frankfurt, playing alongside Sess, Son had taken 6 shots, and 100% of them shots-on-target. This is as easy to understand as basic football, unless you are preferring to ignore the stats.",He‚Äôs such a dumbfuck.

Today is a direct result of his refusal to rotate his squad throughout the season. Nobody today looked comfortable. Nobody looked like they knew what their team mates were doing. I'm not blaming the players. I'm blaming the system. The dogshit tactics that Conte refuses to change.  I could probably put a pub team together that could give this Tottenham team a run for their money because I know exactly how Conte would set his team out. I'd probably lose but fuck me.","People forgot he was absolute quality in the midfield last season, he just had to remind them",ok take a breather pal,pedro poor-o,"Wow. We are truly a mid table side. This performance, like so many this season, is passive and aimless.

So I agree we was a lot better. But that wouldn‚Äôt be hard.  Overall I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs done pretty good.,We still give the ball away too much and suffer from piss poor starts and that needs to (and I think will) improve however fuck it were in the next round baby!

I just wanted a good day but I'm tired as hell.
At home too, damn. 


Welp, gotta be stronger mentally than the team to get through this week. All of y'all take care of your mental health and don't let this team get you too high or too low.","Of course he can be criticized. But at the moment most people here are biased against him not for him. He was late to the ball but doesn‚Äôt mean it was reckless. Palinha‚Äôs tackle was ‚Äúreckless‚Äù not Sonny‚Äôs. 

Also where did you get lost ball 11 times? FBref doesn‚Äôt have any match data yet, and whoscored says dispossessed 3 time unsuccessful touches 1. You can tell me that‚Äôs shit data but I have no way to judge that.

Deki made 6 unsuccessful touches but no one talks about that and rightly so bc it‚Äôs part of his game and he has to try. 

Im not saying he‚Äôs doing great but he‚Äôs doing what he‚Äôs asked. When you look at the situations that he‚Äôs in, you can see why it‚Äôs not working.",,"Indeed, hopefully Conte will put more trust in them going forward.","It doesn't help that we're utterly abysmal at retaining the ball at the start of practically every single game and it puts our CBs under unnecessary constant pressure

It's a whole team problem not just the CBs as to why we're on this appaling run of first half performances - better centre backs may help us get away with them more often but the real issue runs much deeper","I think that's what he was doing though.

He was showing Conte that he could follow the system and do the job Conte wants, rather than doing his own thing and trying to impress.

Literally just get it on the wing and hoof it with a cross into the box.

Move on to saturday.",Def noticed that on the broadcast - thought maybe they gave away shirts on the seats for first game back in CL,Solid defensively. His clearances were pretty bad tho. Still got the job done,Gianni Vio GOAT,I fucking love him so much already. What an amazing piece of business
322,People just need to accept that Spurs are not the type of team that wins trophies. Just enjoy the mediocrity.,just came to my mind that Son was also shit last year against middlesbrough,Feeling much less troubled by the Bentancur injury with how Skipp has been showing up. Hopefully he continues!,"That's the only thing he's lacking, work on those long/through balls & he'll be much better!","If Dier and Davies had played like Japhet today, we could‚Äôve kept them to 2. 

Japhet got burned in defense (and saved by the flag), but he didn‚Äôt pass the ball directly to their attackers like Davies, Perisic, and Dier did.",Fade me,"Not surprised that a club thats finished below us for the pst 6 years is still willing to back their manager and cough up money for players that he wants, and now theyre reaping the rewards.  Thank you to levy for taking us out of mid table but his time here is done",We never win on my birthday.,"Well first, the result doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate a certain process. Yes Son did step on an ankle hence why he got carded. He was also surrounded by players while moving at a rapid pace, so many would agree that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to call that a ‚Äúreckless‚Äù challenge, in sports it‚Äôs natural to do ‚Äòhustle plays.‚Äô

Second, the system is completely different from last season, and many people that watched both seasons know this.

Last season, the team was playing a fast counterattacking style with Kane as the main playmaker and Son using his pace and finishing abilities to score goals on the counter. The thing is, this was never what people call ‚ÄòConteball.‚Äô 

If you remember, he was appointed in the middle of the season, so because he didn‚Äôt have time to instill his own values into the team, he utilized two of our greatest assets to success and secured a top four finish. 

This season, since he‚Äôs had time to instill his system to the team, Spurs have shifted to a defensive, wingback dependent tactic that relies on crosses. This is almost the exact same tactic Conte‚Äôs used in his Chelsea and Inter days. 

Data shows that Son has been forced to move more centrally and play less in his optimal positions as Perisic has been playing more in the left-forward region to make crosses. If you look at his shotmaps, compared to last season, this season he gets less chances and the shots he takes are of greater difficulty than last season. 

In conclusion, I‚Äôm not saying you should treat Son as some untouchable saint. What I am saying is that it‚Äôs unreasonable to solely blame the player for their troubles when they won the golden boot the season prior. It‚Äôs more likely that his struggles are related to a deeper issue, i.e. tactics, lack of service, etc.",,"I‚Äôll back him so long as he does what he did today, which is not cutting off the nose to spite the face

Early subs, young players, Kane dropping deep, forwards shifting into a different formation

All anyone was asking of him was to be more flexible and yes his hand was forced but it‚Äôs good to seee him make changes",He'll be out the door faster than my father left.,"That's what managers want.

Fans base 90% of their opinions on pure talent and ability. Managers obviously take that into account but there's so much more to it.

Foden being benched by Pep so often is a perfect example of that. Literally said last week that he benches/starts players based off of body language in training","We have 2 different recipes for winning this season:

Play bad first half, smash them the 2nd half by goals from Son and/or Kane

Play bad first half and get behind, 2nd half score a header or two and a goal in the overtime","Honestly in terms of pressing and chance creation, I feel we'd been making steady improvements despite the losses (let's not talk about the Forest game). Kulusevski back is massive, feel we've got enough firepower to be scoring more than we have been.

But the defensive frailties are worrying. I think even earlier in the season, opponents seemed to be cutting us up a bit too easily, it's just over the last few weeks they've started finishing those chances. Honestly it's the defence that worries more than our attacking...

Also, I'm not a big critic of Conte like a lot of people seem to be these days, but with each passing game, his insistence on sticking with Emerson becomes less and less defensible...",ANY,,"Tough day at the office but a much better performance than others recently. Starting Perisic up front showed we were really down to the bare bones but save a defensive howler we were largely solid.

Second half was really good, couple of chances hit the woodwork and carved out a few decent chances aside from those. Kulu back is huge. Not too downbeat about it, we should go into the World Cup in the top 4 and we can regroup after with a fitter squad.

We need to get him more gametime, he gives us something we haven't got up there in his pure dribbling ability.","Expectations going into the game were low considering historical results at the Emirates and their recent form, so even though I am not happy about the game, this is a pretty good silver lining.","Fairs, Kane looks in the form of his life and Spurs are capable of grinding wins against opponents that they would usually lose to","Its energy taxing to press every 3 days, this isn‚Äôt Fifa, players get tired","Lmfao!
I watched the first half but missed the second half to goto brunch with my gf. Brunch it is every game from now on","Richy hasn't really done anything playing on the right.  Tears it up when it comes on for Son on the left.

Hasn't looked good in ages. Bring on a different midfielder? Skipp is the same as Hoj and Bentancur and looked rusty coming back from injury. Sessegnon? Probably the best option, but when we did bring him on, we still looked putrid.

What this mainly tells me is our depth basically isn't as good as we thought.

Spurs.,"This is a hot take, but I could‚Äôve saw a draw coming against West Ham. We allow team chances in the box too easily. I do not like this 2-man, conceding midfield strategy is not going to work against Fulham at the weekend.

Everybody knows we are going to try to play out the the wings and even when we do get counter-attacks, the guy that‚Äôs there to finish or play the final ball doesn‚Äôt make it stick.

I think someone on View from the Lane saying that Mitrovic will take his chances against us this weekend and I totally see that happening. Too many chances we‚Äôre allowing teams and it‚Äôs going to punish us.

All of Leeds goals were the result of elite attacking play, not our weak back line.","Truly shambolic refereeing, Mangala body checked Bissouma without even going for the ball for what I believe led to Forest‚Äôs first goal and then Kulusevski does the same and then he remembers that it‚Äôs a foul.

But If there's ever a case where a loss was primarily down to an individual mistake(s) it was today.

The first goal was a result of shambolic defending and overall poor play that we've seen in first halves recently, but after that and for the next 75 minutes we were the better team. Conte cannot legislate for Dier giving away a sure chance out of absolutely nothing. Neither can he do much now with the fact we only have one real quality defender that wasn't even on the pitch today (Lenglet has been good tbf and Davies is serviceable at best). Obviously the continued selection of Emerson is a glaring problem that is on Conte. We saw the difference Doherty made. Was it an issue of Doherty not being completely fit to play the whole match?

Conte is being paid huge wages because he‚Äôs a world class manager. World class managers should know when to change things before it‚Äôs too late.

From Norwich to this?,I WILL BE BUZZING ALL WEEK LONG,Shocking performance by Hojberg,"so sloppy on the ball its unreal. real weakness have there in the team generally and the keeper. just dont have those finesse players for passing esp. in the midfield two. front three seem to have little support. even the interplay on the left with perisic seemed a little stale, mostly from what i remember he offered those crosses but they didnt really have an impact. often not even enough people in the box though feel by the end we were playing for the draw. emerson literal blackhole. really dont like seeing him on the pitch though our alternatives are so limited. unbelievable. and imo son should have come off again for richarlison. think kulusevskis ability to hold up the ball is so crucial and bringing him off loses such a big dimension of the attack. also sanchez. i get he has played well defensively but its not good to have him there for long stretches with such a limited stretches because of his ball playing weaknesses. why its sad we cant get in another good ball playing centreback and only have tanganga and sanchez as back up which is really bad tbh if we get a bad injury. dont know if im too upset with the draw away after having cooled off but that was such an annoying match. first one of the season tbh because from our play in the first half we seemed to control it but i think still sloppy passes to an isolated front three were problem and then sloppy passes at the back where its hard to get out",It was the opponents fault. No credit to Son.,"We are not uncomfortable without the ball, or sitting into a mid/lower block.

It was always extremely na√Øveof forest to rush us early in game and overcommit, tactic was shown to be shit in literally 5 minutes and with better finishing that game would have been forest rushing, us breaking and banging them 5+ - 0.

Conte after the interview talked about us not being as good with the ball, which is the area we need to improve on.

So effectively out of ball he's ok with where the team is, with ball, we have to hold ball more, pass better.","This is a nice summation. Those 7 points are invaluable come the end of the season.

We're not the only side that has been off the pace though. And sadly *they* have been playing well too. The worst possible combination for us. 

IMO the first XI selection was wrong too. Given his intensity, Gil should have started over Son, who has unfortunately been off the pace of late.

I vehemently disagree that it was anything close to ""studs up"" but i understand that Scum would be saying the same thing the other way. In context it was a completely laughable decision from Taylor. I'm actual just concerned for his mental well being at this point. Completely shocking decisions (or lack thereof) early and then even more bizarre in the other direction later in the match. Taylor was in rare form even for him today.","Idk, theyre dropping more points than usual, we still have 2 chances against them, the world cup adds a level of randomness, we have been better at creating more chances this year despite not playing to our ability, and I think we are in for a big winter window, especially if we are in the ucl still.

1. Well, I guess we had to lose someday. 
2. Son is not working. I love the man to death, but he is just not playing well at all.
3. Conte needs to start making more subs. He can't just put in one sub every game and hope for the best. Especially after the yellow cards to our entire midfield.
4. Opposition teams have figured out that by man marking our entire front line, you can take them out of the game. Conte needs to find a solution to this and fast.
5. I hope this will come as a slap to everyone in the team and we improve, because even though we had a good start this season, we can become even better.",May need to have Kane drop deeper into midfield like last season to save this buildup and to feed passes forward to Kulu and Son,Against city?? We'll be in the low block all day defending and when we get those few counterattack opportunities we need someone to blaze the pitch.,I'd like to think that was the game plan to sit deep and counter as it almost worked repeatedly throughout.

""Going backwards doesn't mean the end of the attack. It's the start of a new one.""

Unfortunately a lot of teams in the prem have improved on pressing due to better tactical managers in the league. 

Additionally, our defenders are awful playing against the press/playing at the back. Sanchez is always going to rely on his right foot hence limiting options and has poor composure on the ball. Emerson and Sess can barely beat their man on 1 on 1. Dier and Davies have recently struggled with their long balls. Hopefully Lenglet can be rotated in since passing is supposed to be one of his strengths, though Dier's leadership and Davies crucial tackles will be tough to replace.

I never saw issues with our playstyle until 2019, what on earth happened since then",His crossing looked really good. Lots of pace and he was putting it into dangerous areas.,"The intensity of our defending was particularly pathetic. 352 is supposed to unleash Bentancur and Hojbjerg to become pressing machines but they constantly just sat deep and defended zonally in front of the defence instead of putting pressure on the likes of Bruno when he had hours to pick out a through ball.

And then when they did decide to press, the rest of the team wasn't backing them up. Our problems with possession were more to do with not winning the ball back enough than it was to do with any of our passing. We looked shamefully meek, just content to stand 2 yards off United at all times.

A couple of horrific individual performances, most notably from Dier, but that game comes primarily down to mentality and cowering under the pressure.

Hopefully we can get some reinforcements in the next couple of weeks because it all seems a bit stale around the club at the moment.","Just not enough quality players.

Yes, I think you're right about that.","Not to be negative but am I the only one getting ''Poch in the CL final run'' vibes? Not in the sense that we play similar, just in the sense that barely scraping through 1st in the group covers up so many cracks, just like reaching the CL final in one of the most insane runs ever papered over how bad we looked domestically, which ultimately saw Poch sacked.

Yet again we looked pretty shite (that first half was atrocious) and it took *another* set-piece and *another* last second goal to win. I know, just enjoy it, relax, doesn't matter how they go in, fuck Marseille, we're through, etc - but nothing about today was really encouraging and any indication that things are improving. In fact it's kind of worse because of all games to get fired up for it's this one, yet we came out passive and devoid of well, anything.

I'm kind of concerned. We need a big window somehow and to bounce back after the WC full steam ahead without this weird looking like a legit League 1 team every first half strategy. It's almost reached the point I'd be oddly apathetic to Juve or something trying to poach Conte.

Needless to say we're the ones to blame since we can't land a pass even if our lives fucking depended on it LOL,"Given that Kulu is hurt and Lucas just came back from injury, he needs to play more and get that exposure.

Nah",If anything he's pretty clearly solidified them,"All of our midfielders play the whole pitch, especially in the 352.

Fuck Chelsea and then fuck them again.","I think a point to make here is that it seems like behind the scenes Conte is very concerned about rotating Kane or Son as they likely see their positions as untouchable and might mentally implode as a reaction to a benching. I also think this whole idea of ""lets help Sonny get one"" has only made our whole attack more dysfunctional, go back to what worked Conte... a playmaker and two scorers, not three right footed forwards who all look to score themselves","If you think about our performance in the past few games OBJECTIVELY (not as a Tottenham supporter,) (1) how do you rate our performances, (2) how much do you think our team has improved compared to the end of the last season, and (3) what are the most pressing issues that we are facing right now?","Or, and hear me out...

Sarr was outstanding.,Its not like he had enough time with them weekly training sessions but a bad defender will always be a bad defender,"What the actual fuck lol.

Lloris mistakes against Arsenal and Newcastle, Dier mistake today. Performance was better but Liverpool are poor this season.","Amazing comeback and character but still so concerning how we played in the first half and also how we struggle to really cut teams open bar set pieces, once we get Kulusevski back it‚Äôll change I‚Äôm sure but we definitely need some new players as well as haven‚Äôt looked right this season, an unconfident back line makes it so hard for a team to do well as the rest of the team doesn‚Äôt feel confident and everyone has to compensate, so we definitely need to improve our defence. Also I‚Äôm hoping to see more of a system and tactics from Conte as our team atm feels very all over the place and we mostly play like Stoke.","On of the things that I think is fucking us up in these type of games, is Conte's stubbornness, confidence, persistence, call it as you wish. I don't think our players are that bad that they can't play a simple forward pass in the 10 last minutes of the game, or think of something more creative than passing it in a U shape from wingback to wingback, through our CBs. I think Conte's patterns of play are so rigid, that you simply can't try anything on your own no matter the minute, scoreline or any given situation of the game. So there you are, losing at home, passing it with your other CB, hoping for an opening or something that can trigger one of the actions you prepared in training. You don't even think about something else.",Or clear and obvious,I would say we don‚Äôt have the right midfielders to play 3-5-2.

I really think Richarlison and Son makes the front 3 too vertical and Deki does a much better job of working the flank with Emerson behind him. Emerson just had too much space. 

Overall though I don‚Äôt think our woes are necessarily one or two players here and there. I mean we had to lose eventually and I‚Äôll take a CL loss as long as something good comes out of it and we get it sorted out for the league.

Getting anything at Stamford Bridge is great.","I am a Sporting fan and i my comment might seem biased now, but i have had read comments here prior to the match saying Sporitng would be beaten 0-3 or others claiming you would be victorious due to the odds...

I think people often do wrong acessments...

I always had the conviction that we could perfectly beat tottenham in a good day, and let me teell you:

We didnt even had a good day yesterday, Sporting teem played tired, the squad rotation was non existant in the last few weeks, Sporitng players in the midfield like Morita and Ugarte seemed less intense than usual and even Pote who is our main attacking man (not Edwards) was clearly not at this best.

I had also seen Tottenham a couple this seasons, vs Chelsea, Wolverhampton and Marselle, and in all those games i had a clear impression of a team filled with 3 or 4 top class players but a very poor dynamic...

And  just by knowing that, i knew Sporting gameplay is very cohesive and the players are fully identified with the idea of the manager in how to play, they are correct for the system and they are very good players...

You people are so easily deceived by your acessment that having a 600 million budget means that you automaticaly win vs a team with a 60k yearly budget...

Dudes look at the players Sporitng have... any player, ANY, woudl easily be a srarting 11 in  majority of English premier league teams, the budget means nothing, any players from Sporting woudl be an important player if signed by any English team... and that means their current wages are not fully translated

Because i can garantee you that if i have to build a single team from Tottenham and Sproting players, the full 11 wont be yours, there are positions where i can garantee you that Sporitng wins easily, specialy in the midfield, Ugarte is much better than anything you have, Porro is much better than your full back on the right certainly...

Defense we have had super solid Coates for years, our most experient players allready had top european clubs experience...

So to beat Sporting you would not only to count on being absolutely great...

We couldnt enforce our dynamic, if we could like we usualy do with a proper 7 day rest before the match (like you had) we would had betean you way more easily...

Sporting knew when to halt you and when to foirce, the team was intelligent, they couldnt play with the isual intensity for 80 or 90 minutes, so they lowered the pressure...

Sporting is usualy the team in Portugal with high pressure, what you did to us in the first minutes of the match and second half... that high pressure is usualy what we do to any team here, its an advantage of the 3-4-3 and despite Conte is certainly a very competant manager i see you Tottenham struggling to display a solid performance...

I would say for the players you have, the output you get from the matches is not good, there is something missing between your colective gameplay, i dont know if its the mistranslation between the ideas of the manager and what the players understand or if some players are not performing at their best, from the way i see it, your front trio is among the best n the EPL, you should much better than that.

Last year City gave us a master class, they were a good example of how breakdown not only the way we play but also for having better players than we do, but then we learned and we did draw the game in Manchester...

So you really did downplayed this team a lot...

Amorim Sporting's is not be fucked with...","That was genuinely one of the worst games I've ever watched, refereeing was awful, both sides lacked any serious quality, both goals were from rubbish mistakes.

Some of our best build up play and chance creation in a long time. 

Their first goal was a scramble, and the second was good play. Perisic fucked it for the third but I thing Lloris has been unfairly slated for that goal, it was hit so well that any nick would have been impossible to react to. It was just unfortunate, especially with how we hit the post earlier. 

The fourth goal was the worst though, wtf was Lenglet even trying there ffs.

Bissouma i think we understand why bigger clubs werent after him. Lad can not pass teh ball to save his life. constantly carried it to its destination and brought the press with him.

Please god let Romero be healthy. Watching the four brain cells in Sanchez head short circuit every time he has the ball at his feet is just sad. 

He can defend, but‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt he learn how to kick a ball?

Bissouma with a zero heart performance on debut pissed me off. Make some mistakes for sure. But don‚Äôt walk around the pitch and get caught napping. We could have kept Winks for that. 

PEH gets a pass because he was injured and still 2x Bissouma. 

Perisic amazing as always. Kane was pretty good if no goals. 

Son? What‚Äôs up lad? Someone siphoned his mojo like Daniel Day Lewis. 

Emerson, while pretty crap at playing out from the back, actually out in a shift and was dangerous. I have low expectations for him but he did a decent job.

Happy with the point but we actually deserved the W,"Anyone who is creative and a dribbler by nature

The LW in Conte‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt require a goalscorer like Son, it requires someone who can create for the striker and get out of tight spaces. Basically be very good with the ball

My first two choices to replace him were Felix and Gakpo in that order. Both are unattainable now

All three of CP‚Äôs wingers can do a better job than him. But yeah Eze would be a very good replacement.

Feel like there were a couple clear opportunities to play sonny through today...,"Yeah, we all get on players like Cuti for losing their heads but for the coach to get a red when we need wins desperately is just stupid.",What depresses me even more is that we only had 55 passes less than them.,,"Yeah really. 

We were in on goal with a 2v1 or 2v0 situation twice I believe and came away with nothing.","Only the final pass was missing in the first half. Richy, Kane, and Son all misplaced several passes they shouldn't have, and Arsenal's suicidely high line would've turned those into goals.",I find it attractive. Chances on the counter are way more exciting than slow buildup stuff.,"He's always been that way, fast but with a heavy touch that lets him down. Emerson just seems a more popular hate figure for some reason.

Spence is the future. I accept Conte knows what he's doing so he obviously isn't ready yet - but he looked an absolute beast in the England U21 match against Italy.",This is the kind of danger an in form son poses to any team,"Lol, an attacking player is struggling because he is getting too much support on his flank??

Imagine Salah complaining because TAA is too high up on the right side.

Or Messi complaining because Alves was intruding in his space 
..

Son is in poor form -- Perisic has nothing to do with it.

Once Son is back in form, he will excel based Perisic contributions.",Perisic set pieces,"If there was ever a game to lose this season it was that one, just hope it shines a light on our problems as opposed to a narrow win/ draw just papering over the cracks like they have been",Conte reminded us of Prime Nuno and worst Jose today,And if Conte benches him on the weekend I trust we won't see Son fans first Spurs fans second throwing their toys out of the pram?,"The thing is though, people will say Son was poor but I actually thought he was decent. Not great but he played some nice through balls and made intelligent runs. His finishing was poor but he sets such high standards. He continues to do what the team needs and what Conte asks of him.

I'm going off football more every year since var and am gutted how shit the sport is becoming.","Agree. we can point at a lot of things but our midfield was non-existent in another big game yet no one is talking about PEH and Bissouma. Sort of bizarre. Their press ate our midfield alive. We can talk all day about how our forwards don't get enough touches and how our defenders constantly have to make last ditch challenges, but the answer is obvious to me. Midfield constantly collapses on the CBs and offers no control of tempo or grab of the game.   


We get battered because our midfield is TRASH. look at other conte teams. the midfield is the key component to a) stop them attacking our defence and b) forcing sharp transitions so our forwards get the ball in space and not hunkered down by midgets like Shaw and Martinez",,Who could‚Äôve come on from the bench to replace him though lol?,Lol we were losing and had conceded two goals when he was sent off. Going to plan you day?,"Is about the goals, wining, be solid at the back,  and everything we're doing right.

Still, would like to see how this 352 team plays against good teams, not the worst team in the league.","Ignore the fact Son messed up most of our good chances  tonight and put all the blame on Perisic lol. It's not Perisic's fault Son's touch has been off, his passing has been poor, and his finishing has been wayward.",GET FUCKED CHELSEA,"Wahhhh start Spence wahhh why not give him a chance??

Five games now where he's offered the sum total of fuck all while Richy has come on and looked lively, energetic and forceful.

Getting to be beyond a joke at this point. You either have a meritocracy, or you don't. You either reward good performances, or you let wasteful, rusty players coast on name and reputation alone.

there is still something wrong with Son mentally even after that hat trick. His passing was way off and his decision making, especially in terms of runs, was just downright weird.

I'm confused by your Sessegnon comment.

The 343 was by intent today. By playing that we'll always concede the midfield and force teams into long range shots. Today it cost us for the first with the rapist's goal, which is rather fluke in it's own right. It's not like we gave Steven Gerrard acres of space, we gave space to someone who's never scored from outside the box and he struck lucky, just like he did with UK/Spanish jurisdictions.

The second goal was a GK blunder and the 3rd was with 10 men.

I turned the game off after that to watch F1, but I don't recall any glaringly obvious chances up until 3-1? Jesus' solo run was just special, but that's not a system issue that created the chance, that's world class dribbling.

I'd rather have got 352 personally and played for a smelly draw, but we also wouldn't have created the openings we did in that first half with it, our goal literally came from the wide men hustling. Our best chance of winning was 343 and if Richarlison could have made more of opportunities in that first half, we could have lead the game with that 343.","Bissiuma solidified the center, looked strong defensively, had some good offensive passes, but really freed up Hojberg and Bentancur to attack.

A few observations;

Son needs to be dropped for his own sake.

Conte's stubbornness is costing us. There are other coaches in this league who would change tactics at the drop off a hat. He's had some time to make it work and it's not working.

Made so many progressive passes. Unlucky to not score from Richarlison‚Äôs cross.,"Yeah it's gonna get lost in the (justified) complaining about shit officiating, but we just weren't good enough today outside of that. Very flat. Royal caught in the middle and doing nothing effective. And the gaps between our front line and midfield have been pretty shocking. Need to see some changes for a run, and not just ones induced by injury.",I missed the entire 2nd Half which sucks as I‚Äôm reading everyone having a orgasm over it - need to know what Biss and Doherty did  as well that made them stand out.,I feel like a lot of Contes words came from a place of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs still recovering from injury‚Äù rather than ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not up to snuff‚Äù,Walt Whitman-esque,"It's also his first game in 57 years, should probably get some play time",I would absolutely LOVE to see what our dressing room looks like right now,Emerson must have Contes wife‚Äôs nudes. How does he start almost every single game and Djed not get a single sniff?,"I'll say it until I'm blue in the face, knowing full well how unpopular of an opinion it is and that Conte is probably our best bet to win anything. I hate our formation. I hate our tactics. I do not like Conteball. Zero aggression on defense, preferring to collapse and force shots from distance. Fine, it's not my preference but I can live with that, but offensively we're a joke. No desire. No effort. No pressing. No creativity. No forcing the issue. No trying to bury your opponent. 

How does a manager who talks about killing the opposition have his team playing like this? Crosses into the box or the occasional counter. Otherwise we're standing around waiting for the game to come to us.  We got up 1-0 and played like our intent was to grind out a 1-0 victory and that's a complete fucking joke to approach the game that way. Wolves, Forest, and now West Ham. All the same approach. These teams aren't City or Pool. I can understand it for the Chelsea match, but they fucking suck and in retrospect our tactics look like dogshit there too. I look forward to us sitting back against Fulham and not trying to bury that opponent either.

And don't get me started on the substitution strategy...","Son runs way more than Kane. Also don't forget when Kane quit on spurs last season, son carried the torch all the way to the golden boot. Other than Kane we don't have a single player on our team who could win the golden boot. He has a unique skill set that neither richy or deki possess and that's blistering pace mixed with 2 footedness",">We can be excited for Richarlison to get more playing time without bashing Sonny.

I think most of us can agree with that. That being said, I take issue with this sub going apeshit to protect Son while at the same time being fine with basing a plethora of other players. 

Son has been completely off form for the last 3 games (Chelsea, Wolves, today). Simple as. Does he deserve to be crucified for that? No, of course not. But it should be perfectly acceptable to point out that he's not contributing at the expected level of not just Son, but a starting player, without getting down voted into oblivion. 

We have Richarlison, a player that has lifted our team noticeably every time he's come on, waiting in the wings. Why is it heresy to suggest we give him a shot over Son?",He‚Äôll bang in 15+ after all is said and done. He‚Äôll find his first touch I‚Äôm sure of it.,agreed. Also Lenglet was more involved with the buildup play than Dier today. Lenglet just looks comfortable dealing with opposition's press.
365,"My angry reactive take is if we lose Wednesday then we need a coaching change it‚Äôs that simple, just keep mason on. Too bad for Conte to come back for one game just to possibly lose his job but it‚Äôs what it is",We truly do get battered,It's a different style of play I swear. Spurs selectively press in a way they don't do under Conte.,"I think the takeaway should be 'Kane dropping deeper is the answer' not 'sub in Sonny is always goals'. This would've not worked in a draw or losing scoresheet. It works when the opposition has the incentive to attack and raises their line. Son might be in terrible form, but his finishing ability is at least there. It's better to exploit that imho like last season. Conte has been using him all wrong.","Tanganga was covering Porro, what game you watching?",Sigh...,"So many problems at this club. How can we rock up at home for the NLD and put that shift in.

Our rivals are improving season on season and looking to strengthen again this window and we are tussling on media rumours. 

Hard to be a Spurs fan right now.","You're a better Kat than I. I left early for the first time ever. Feel bad about that, but feel better for getting the 4.18 from Fins PK and not waiting another hour.",,,"He looked like the player we thought we were getting with Bissouma.

That's the point. ‚ô•Ô∏è,No nails left,It‚Äôs on r/soccer,In his time he showed he‚Äôs better than Emerson and Doherty without a doubt,,Yes! I enjoyed this match very much,Propper Tottenham game that,"Some mugs paid ¬£80 to go to the stadium, consider yourself lucky.",like i know this is a meme but does anyone feel like that was a good use of their time? I'm fucking done,We only have 2-3 world class players. The rest are mid table cannon fodder.,,He must be on God Mode during training.,If it wasn't for some semi-butchered final third passes in the first half we did quite well in creating chances on the counter imo. But we couldn't create an attack by playing out of defence at all,I agree.,Yeah Doherty much better than Emerson in every aspect except for physique. He‚Äôs much smarter,Ohhhh I like this phrase,"i think he can make it as long as he doubles down on his strengths (speed and wilyness) i mean dudes like bruno fernandes and b silva work, we should reward his effort after a frustrating first year",So which place did Hertz not get a yellow? Did he not get a yellow arguing or did he not get a yellow for literally CLOBBERING Romero? Because the announcers said he got a yellow both times yet he was not shown a red?,"None of us can pretend to know the squad like Conte does, and given what he‚Äôs done for the club it‚Äôs far too early to be calling for his head. But he definitely needs to change his approach:

1) ROTATE THE FUCKIN PLAYERS. Not just the back three. Everyone. Start Doc over Emerson. Not like he can do much worse. Use Sonny as a supersub till he gets his form back. Give Skipp and Lenglet significant game time. 

2) MAKE SOME DAMN SUBS. When you have five subs to work with, you should be making at least three per game, ideally all five with the depth we have. There are SO MANY reasons to make subs. Fatigue, knocks, YCs, poor performances, bad matchups, or even just to keep opponents on their toes. When I play FIFA I sub my most tired players out at 60‚Äô, 70‚Äô, and 80‚Äô like clockwork. Every game. Regardless of game situation. Not that I claim to know more about football than Conte (and not to imply that FIFA is anything like real life), but that wouldn‚Äôt be the worst idea.",Love the guy but how does son stay on for 90 he was absolutely worthless,"Yeah, because Son just walks around scratching his belly? He gives his all too, it's just not working",">Sonny is off form right now 

Son is off form now... And the week before... And the week before that... And the week before that as well.","I think that's more than fair! I 'm just surprised with his touches. They seem so heavy it's like he can't control the ball at the moment, but it's too early to complain but i am kinda worried.",Yes
366,ENIC out. Conte out. Blow the whole team up and bring in some youngsters interested in playing football. Send Kane to Man U and Son to Fuckoffistan FC.,Poverty franchise.,"It does mean something when you have a solid win against your kryptonite. But you‚Äôre right. 

This is probably how City felt beating us at the Ethihad and then they strolled into their second against us with too much confidence.","To cap off Richy's performance today as decent is also flawed. he missed chances, made critical errors, and did nothing great.","Top team? Friend, we may play the worst football in the entire league bar Bournemouth.",Think this performance showed it's more of a players issue than coach. Conte's system can work and create chances. Also limited city's chances in the first half. Poor defence was the death of us.,This is what happens when the results and play on the football field is not your priority,"I watched until 60 mins, turned off to do something else while listening to in on the radio. Gradually turned the volume down and eventually turned that off too.",,,"Gottaa give Bissouma time though, he is brilliant at his best. Hopefully he can find form here.","Performing to a level expected of us is not impressive, it‚Äôs the bare minimum.",,"Love the result but definitely bet on a draw, haha :(",Simply incredible check out the moment where he got the Leeds player sent off! Imposed himself physically,Better than Royal and doc this season,,Honestly I maintain that if we sort out our defence you'll see us play sooo much better,Sanchez needs a long break on the bench.

There has to be a change made at that position or we will miss our mark this year.",The two man midfield is the most frustrating part for me. Has literally not worked well in 10 matches this season.,"Kane's form is actually relatively worse imo, his standard is higher than current one

Statwise it's certainly good though",Definitely agree Doherty was class today. You can tell he‚Äôs still getting there fitness wise tho. He was way better in the first half. Happy to see him back,"Such fine poetry, with delicate skipping cadence.

Son HATERS can GARGLE a BALL sack.","1st game in forever, on a big stage too. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to judge him much on this game",Don't venture into r/soccer...,Everyone needs to calm down. Should we have won? Yes. Conte is embarrassed by this performance I think he realizes he needs to start rotating players regularly and start to put trust in other players in our squad because with the 5 sub rule the game completely changes in the way other teams will regularly bring on fresh legs while conte is used to same squads. Also not an excuse or anything but I‚Äôm glad to have lost away than at home,Feels like with Richarlison starting for Son we win this game. Honestly it's a bit arrogant to start players playing poorly over players playing well and expect 3 points from difficult fixtures.,Those saying that he is washed has short term memory with him being our best performer for the past two seasons.,"Yes. We don‚Äôt see this nearly often enough. I don‚Äôt care what the player or the coaching staff want, the decision needs to be made without interference by the medical team and in the best interests of the player‚Äôs health. So many times that hasn‚Äôt been the case. I‚Äôm thinking specifically of Jan but there have been many others.",Not even a doubt. Kanes second half was much improved,"Very impressed.

Looks really comfortable out there.  

Some excellent long forward passes that I‚Äôve never, ever seen Davies make once."

He really can‚Äôt handle being subbed, even after 70 minutes trying to get his mojo back",A rational take holy shit. Yah he‚Äôs not in form but he can easily start for any top 5 club.

Dier is a solid center back, but lacks speed and positioning on right or left. Needs a backup.

Emerson seems like a really nice guy. As a right wing back, he seems like a really nice guy. Doherty very obviously makes the right side more dangerous, but Spence needs to play to develop, too.

Hojberg is very negatively affected by accumulated fatigue. There are dozens of players that have been talked about to help back him up.

Arsenal dominated the first. Us the second. The only difference at the end was the goalkeepers.

Love the front 3 to death but I really do believe changing up the midfield to have 3 countering the press rather than 2 leaving open gaps, look at the reece james goal and soucek goal today, purely because the midfield didnt pick up the player or make a challenge.

I really want us to show some more aggressive play it doesn‚Äôt have to be attacking if Conte likes his defensive style of play, but at-least be aggressive in the challenges and don‚Äôt let the other teams control the game.

I saw comments describing him as having a horrible touch, kills the play, play him out right, LWB.. and obviously benched (and not for rest but actually bench him). He chose to stay with us even with Kane almost leaving and he had choices to leave with Real Madrid, Liverpool, etc eyeing him. 

Seeing toxic comments about Lloris when he has had a rough patch is so fucking irritating and sad at the same time. He‚Äôs been world class his career, our/France captain, WC winner and semi finalist, and clutch for us. Yeah he‚Äôs had his bad moments this season and yes we need to get a replacement soon but I just wish he gets the respect he deserves. I bet those fans really miss him now lol especially after Leceister.

Eric Dier as well - he‚Äôs been nothing but a great professional. Has been crucified recently and yeah I get it, stupid mistakes and we definitely need upgrades in defense but he was crucial last season especially so some respect would be great

Same contact,Lads deserve a fucking good break after this,Only minor positive from this game. Spurs are the RoP of the LOTR franchise at the moment.,"Eh, I think Tottenham played well.

First off Sporting are clearly a very well coached team with some real talent in the team. I think Pedro Porro, Nunos Santos, Ugarte & their keeper were all sublime. If Skipp wasn't a Tottenham lad I'd think it'd be worth trying to sign Ugarte- what a player he is.

Secondly I think Tottenham created more than enough chances to win, even excluding the disallowed goal. Clearly being the team in control isn't a position of comfort for Tottenham, but they showed some great attacking movement and one touch passing. Some real great intensity and energy in the second half.

Thirdly it's clear Tottenham are a team lacking confidence. Kane, Romero, Perisic, Dier, Son & Lloris are all in pretty horrible individual form compared to how good I know they can play. I'm hoping that Kulusevski & Richarlinson can re-inject some precision & confidence into the team. The Sporting goal is one that, even just a few weeks ago, Tottenham would've never conceded.

I guess the reality is we should be hammering link-up and final third patterns every single day in training until we get over this hump.

Midfield loses the ball all the time. Were slow on the ball and often lose it when we try and be fast. Our system prioritises very very good wing backs and we have a good wing back and one who is improving but not good enough.

Sons nowhere near good enough this season so far and should have been substituted around the 60m mark, he's offering nothing and is being carried by the team so far, which is grand but shows in games like these. 

Missed bentacur as well. One side note the ref was patheticly one sided and barely gave us a thing the whole match.","He's class, both as a player and a privileged role model. I long ago stopped caring what other fans thought of him - one of my favourite spurs players. Also, everyone forgets he was one of the Prem's POTS in 2017.","That was then, this is now. If Son can't return to his former skills, then it's logical to bring in someone who actually can at this moment.

Spurs needs a player who can bring impacts more than ever, since Conte announced that he is resting Kane.","Palace has a really solid squad this year.

I‚Äôve honestly never seen any team succeed with a 3-4-3 in this day and age and it clearly ain‚Äôt helping that our backline has zero clue on how to deal with presses from the opposition.

Is this a joke? People have been universally criticising Conte for been too slow at integrating the new players. Perisic is the only one of the summer signings to be a regular starter and even he's shared his minutes pretty evenly with Sessegnon.

It‚Äôs not a sustainable way to play and was shouted from the heavens from a lot of us on here the first half of the season. It‚Äôs been predictable since September that this type of horrific run of form was coming","I'd sell Son and buy Mitoma. The way Mitoma plays is quite similar to how Son played when he was younger.

Too often opportunities for counters are wasted and the defense put under unnecessary pressure because of his haphazard long passes. We need a keeper that can pass well, it's really time to find a replacement.

We miss Kulusevski alot, our ability to retain the ball in attack is greatly diminished without him, now we are back to pinging balls above Son and Kane's heads and hope it lands favorably. We need a capable/similar rotation option for him in January, which I think Conte was looking for in the summer.

We need Udogie now.",Or clear and obvious,"Davies was by far our best defender today, Lenglet wouldn't have helped.",,Sess gets better every game?

He could also mess up by being young and dumb (look at some of his preseason lowlights, id guess partying too much is the likely culprit), and the team could get worse from injury limiting his chances and reducing his confidence.

But i agree, most likely haaland remains scary for most of the remainder of the season, even if his form drops slightly (which i think is inevitable at some point this season, but wont be very significant) Also, defenders have got to be learning how to better deal with him over the course of the season. I also think our more defensive and midfield heavy lineups (3-5-2 mostly to win the midfield battle better and avoid royal messing up build up play). I think teams like us, and Chelsea unfortunately, and tragicly maybe even arsenal can match up well enough to take points off city, and they havent shown to be as consistent as last season despite higher ceiling.

So cool.",How about no,"We were definitely in control, was funny hearing the commentators regularly speak of brighton looking the better team from about 35-70 mins but to me it seemed like it was a very professional performance, low % chances and a bit of possession doesn't mean you are playing better especially when behind",almost lost to the worst team in the league.. definitely outplayed for sure.,Against a 38 year old japanese defender too üòÇ God they are so out of form.

I don't think anyone can really argue that Richi fits the system better than Son does atm.,All he had to do today was basically win headers vs Antonio. When we‚Äôre not constantly under pressure our defenders look much better,[deleted],Why did he bring Davies off? He was playing ok,"Tbh I don't even agree with this.

(I agree with the rule by OP above, I'm just saying in general mods are too overboard with implementing rules)",I think that Conte has told Kane to stay in the box and wait for the crosses from Perisic by Kane not dropping deep there is no space for Son to run into which causes Son to play in a way that he is simply not suited for.,,,Nah Conte brought on Harvey white and Emerson. Free Spence,"Nobody cares about your boycott mate, best World Cup ever.

Even more surprising then, that Conte decided to make the subs so late into the game.",,Frankfurt were fucking shocking.,"Bit of a stretch calling it that when you look at the proposed cast.

Spinoff at best.","I remember someone asked Deki what his best position was and he said while he always considered himself a 10, he's had his most success playing on the right.","Let‚Äôs not sugar coat it, if they weren‚Äôt flying (for now) we‚Äôd be a lot less negative given where we are in the table and the results we‚Äôve had , minus the NLD",Sessegnon was responsible for two goals himself,I liked his energy a lot. His passing was off though. Probably because he hasn't played for us at all.,"FUCK Chelsea. Weee going to have to start incorporating the new guys. Find the 11 that will put us at our best. Overall, FUCK CHELSEA",I was all about playing Son until he comes good but it seems like the more he plays the less confident he becomes :(,"What the fuck was going in at the back ? They keep asking for it. A draw was a fair result but definitely we were luckier. Why do we keep passing around to Sanchez and Lloris while neither are good with the ball ? Reminded me of us V Villa at Home with Mason as manager, where we sabotage ourselves more than anything else.",Lol I thought it was my iPad acting up or something.... glad to know we're playing for shit streams haha,"I kinda thought the same thing. Glad the miss wasn't a costly one, and it takes the pressure off the next one.",Yup. Thought that was one of the worst ref performances against us in awhile.

He‚Äôll be back in the side soon enough",He was but the idea he's our best defender is laughable,"No need to rationalize. He was shit. Doesn‚Äôt doom his time here or make any huge conclusions, but he was awful and spun like a top all game.","Out of nowhere too, I‚Äôve been mostly happy with him on the whole",[removed],Many moments where Son was breaking the line and Perisic just holds on the ball and spam a cross. Son seemed quite irritated by Perisic and returned the same treatment by the end of the 1st half. Perisic was not happy with it. Both were never meant for each other.,,,Hopefully he give them more of a chances against portsmouth,Why are you here then??,,What a goal,"Kulu is MOTM for me by a wide margin. He was massive from the start and crucial to everything positive. Benta with the two goals, but not nearly as impactful throughout.",Yes!!!!!!! Finally the tank is on!,,2 stone cold penalties,And yet next game: heeere's Sanchez and Emerson.,I hope we're in the market for a 1GK. As much as I love the man Lloris he just isn't what he used to be most of the time.,">Royal played it backwards

Yes he did, so it cannot be offside.",Agreed about hojberg. Conte really needs to rotate him and Bentancur,,"Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

Still feel unconvincing and football is terrible to watch for long spells. Is Conte gonna get found out or are we going to turn into some amazing system machine that churns out results consistently? Gonna be an interesting season...","They have no connection cuz conte is forcing son to play a mezzala role, which highlights sons weaknesses. Playing perisic like a wide winger takes away sons space as well. Kane barely drops deep anymore, rightfully so since he's a proper 9 after all, but son and richarlison are not suited for conte's 10s whatsoever. Bascially the top players are deployed wrongly","FUCK CHELSEA, CHELSEAS SHIT!","How many touch passes did we give away? Sporting didn't even have to do anything, we just beat ourselves in the attacking end.","Conte should have used more subs. But I think my take away from today's game is how valuable Bentancur is in the midfield. His composure, pressing, and tackling is class, without him we kept passing around the back and couldn't generate a proper attack.","Agreed, the man clearly has never seen Conte ball before","Man, I dreaded that miss. Henderson got a huge boost from and the entire Forest team and stadium responded. We were under the gun for about 10 minutes until the subs started. 

I wanted Conte to start subbing right away after that. Almost like timeout to stop momentum in the NBA.",The foul on Hojbjerg was a pretty obvious missed call,No. Goal didn‚Äôt happen so the yellow didn‚Äôt happen.

The tactical analysis after wasn't very good either. I've never seen them do a pitch side episode before.,"He's way too passive when the opponent is creating a dangerous situation but today he didn't have to do anything, Romero covered so much from the back and the front, he also gave the ball to Kane for our second goal, legit 10/10 performance","understatement.  and Europe isn't a certainty either.

I am so torn about Harry.

I am not torn about wishing ENIC would sell.",I dont understand where was Lenglet mind there? He could have gotten card there by fouling Mahrez and got us chance to draw or we were losing anyway. It's not like he's much important to us or anything. Send him back to Barca and those fans too who rate him.,Grass üòÇ,He just walks the ball up the pitch whenever Son is clear to go on a run and then passes it back with no options. Just so hard to watch over and over.,,,Skipp started strong and then struggled to keep up with Eze and Zaha as they grew into the game,I think it‚Äôs fair to give Forster a chance‚Ä¶ and give Lloris a break to recover.,,Oh my days the fucking breath of relief at the end there. Felt like I wasn't breathing the last 30 minutes or so,Confused me seeing as Leeds Rodrigo scored twice against us. Realised you meant our Rodrigo.,"Literally failed poch, jose, and now conte and ppl saying conte out. Mad",,"Exactly. You can't give up two stupid goals in the Premier League, especially to good teams. 

Just so, so dumb.",Preach!!!,Lloris arguably saved us losing 4 or 5-0 against Man U and equally arguably cost us this game. Probably would be better for him to just be a normal keeper without the incredible highs and diabolical lows.,If they actually turned up to play for 90 fucking minutes we wouldn't cry about VAR decisions. Conte ball fucking sucks.,"He's good with corners but otherwise slow and predictable. Like you said, he effectively kills the momentum during counterattacks with his lack of pace.",,It seems we actually can't trust most players beyond our starting XI,VAR agrees with him?,No because these fan channels talk some wacky stuff that resemble the match thread here,Maybe they can go for Maddison in January.,The Son of Man.,"To be fair, it wasn't a very long one.

Your 
Berbatov comparison to Richy makes no sense. I thought he was MOTM today, his effort that hit the post was perfection all bar being an inch to the right. That‚Äôs not the easiest ball to attack, and his technique was brilliant. Also worked his socks off.

Wolves next up. Time to rotate some new signings into the starting XI.,"1 substitution in 93 minutes is embarrassing.

What I saw today though I think is very concerning going forward.,"I don't understand why we're being linked to all of these attacking players when the team's defence is utterly shambolic. Romero is the only one that is good enough. The entire team needs an overhaul and sadly that means we are going to lose Kane, and maybe Son. It's our own fault for not investing in the team at the right time. The last transfer window has been terrible. Lenglet poor. Perisic poor. Bisouma poor. We're not making the right choices. Things need to change from the bottom to the top.","How many times has that ""player"" been Lloris this season?","Sorry, what did he do after Perisic came off?

Son and Richarlison are just not suited to defending in a 541. Son was the reason hojbjerg got pulled wide for the Partey goal and he was again at fault for saka's shot which led to the rebound goal.

Bentancur is a little more consistent than PEH, but he‚Äôll have games where his passing is off or even worse.

Perisic‚Äôs passing is good, but him and Son have negative chemistry. Emerson is shit, can only pass backwards.

Sessegnon and Perisic aren't bad, the problem is at RWB.

People keep saying that the reason Spence isn't playing is that he likes to cut inside and drive at the box, and Conte doesn't like that, but I feel like at this point as a manager you need to work around your youth, not punish them.

Sessegnon is another wingback that likes to drive at the box instead, so why not play a set-up based around inverted wingbacks instead and let the kids play?

On one hand we all knew back in the summer that this season would be impossible in terms of the schedule, but on the other hand we should be able to rotate/make proactive substitutions to compensate and our manager can't seem to figure our how to do this effectively.

I don't want to judge Conte based on this season after watching what he could do with one game a week last year, but if Spurs want to win anything at all they have to figure out how to play multiple times a week and this commitment to a 2-man midfield doesn't seem like the way.","Sanchez, Son, Perisic, Hojberg and Richy were all terrible today.

Missing great chances or making terrible touches/decisions in the box honestly seems worse bc the mistakes are so visible & memorable, but that means at least some parts of the gameplan are going right if you keep getting into dangerous places

kane dropping deeper & Perisic not being as aggressive taking up that left space let Son get into these positions & our attack looked a lot better

Simple as","Time to get terrified, Disgusting performance critical issue, Son, Perisic, Emerson had vulgar performances, Europa league after Christmas unless starts to change things or he can be shown the door","That was some of the dullest and most uninspiring play I‚Äôve ever witnessed. Levy, give me my 2 hours back.",‚ÄúReactionary‚Äù to say a player is not in form after half a dozen poor performances.,That wasn't the issue. Having 3 midfielders won't make Bentancur quicker on the ball.,Perisic will go down as one of our best signings of the last decade which anyone who has seen him play regularly will not be surprised by. Man is consistency personified and gives 100% on every play. Plus he is tailor made for the conte system,"You want saggy cheeks? No. Clench up, high and tight."

True things,They‚Äôll get another 3 points off us soon to help towards that.,I said Son shouldn‚Äôt have started in place of Gill. Downvoted.,at least mourinho got the best out of son and kane. Our two biggest players arent even doing anything at the moment,,,Remember when Doherty first joined? It‚Äôs not really weird since he‚Äôs in an entirely new system and Comte‚Äôs a completely different coach than Potter is.,I was even wondering if it was a different variety of sod.

I'm hoping it's just a case of not having any game time. He'll get some more minutes the next couple weeks as Lucas and Kulu are still injured. But man I really want him to do good.,Referee was shockingly bad all game. Should have also had at least 10 mins added on. Barely any football was played in the second half.,lol,"I love Conte, but this was Nuno ball",And it's not just for one game.

It never works.",Oh shit that was him in the third shirt wasn't it. I was thinking I recognized that guy but didn't know where from.,There‚Äôs one in every sub lol.,"This is exactly my view. We need to change to a system that suits the players we have, and provide the defence with more cover. Maybe Contes system can be made to work after another couple of windows, but I have my doubts.

I'm not suggesting that we should sack Conte but after the promising end to last season we've been pretty awful this season although, for a while the results have been going out way. I fully expected the performances to match the results but we've been getting worse if anything.

Harry did a lot of complete shit,We did not deserve the point. Romero should've been sent off. But somehow we stole one and Romero didn't even see a yellow. And I'm totally cool with that.,So add us to the list of teams Conte has failed with im Europe‚Ä¶,"Dier -> Sanchez -> Hojbjerg -> Dier -> Bissouma -> Sanchez -> Dier -> Long ball out of bounds.
Genuinely unwatchable.",You're right but we clearly struggle against teams who press us a lot and are tightly packed at the back. We usually control the middle but we often lack ideas when reaching the penalty area. We just need more confidence and aggression.,"If he never scores again he definitely shouldn't be starting as an attacker... That's insane. 

Maybe Son is better as a super sub coming on with lightning pace. Richarlison has earned a start at this point and we have way too many fixtures coming up anyway",I feel like some of you even want Sonny out of the club,Defo not a pushover squad but we played so well the scoreline was pretty unfair
461,Lucas was our first sub. in 2023,So many not fit to wear the shirt walking around the pitch today‚Ä¶ quite literally walking.,I'm pretty sure you did!,We shouldn't be fooled that today was a game you can judge Dier in anyway. WestHam didn't do anything threatening so Dier was rarely if ever challenged to do anything than be on auto pilot.,">always the manager and not the players?

It's always the defensive managers. Yes","Only positive from this is the Arsenal meltdown on r/soccer, you can tell they are absolutely shitting themselves.","The problem is no real depth for him, it looks like Conte wants to make Gil a backup RW option for Kulu which is fine, Richy should be Kane's backup but there's no real backup for Son, which is something we need to address. No way we ever do it because Levy wouldn't pay it but I would love Kaoru Mitoma from Brighton, he's the kind of player that could give Son competition and be a really good backup as well",Arteta may not be a better manager on paper but the club fully backed his vision for 3 seasons and will continue to do so. It‚Äôs been up and down for them since Wenger left but has there ever been a time where it felt like their club wasn‚Äôt committed to building a winning a project? Because the same really can‚Äôt be said with Spurs.,,,"I think you‚Äôve misunderstood me here, I was referring to Bissouma","It helps having CBs that are actually competent at defending and exhude confidence. Besides Romero, who hasn't hit the heights of last season, our defenders have made numerous errors and can't even play simple passes.

No one looked driven and our game plan looked predictable,Blocked,"Son can't start every game. We play 2 games a week from now to the world Cup

Richarlison is going to start and Son be benched very soon. He also derives a start. Giving a player a break for a game is not some sort of war crime",Soon? He didn‚Äôt even start today. Perisic clear #1 now imo,Yea they‚Äôre a solid mid-table team
462,We won both matches Richarilson and Davies started together and then went back to the same old crap that doesn‚Äôt work.

Just classic Emerson/Sanchez blunders costing us at the back. I think a lot of the problem was the players we had just didn't mesh well together in the first half.,"Why do all that when you can just stop playing ineffective style of football. We look like Burnley. Jose and Conte are meant to be the best at this style of football and it still looks like shit. Except Leicester, we haven‚Äôt looked like we deserved any points this season and I hate watching us play wether we win or lose because of it.","If we lose to Marseille then they're above us.

Betancur is absolutely pivotal to playing out of the back though. He‚Äôs always making himself available and the CBs trust they can play the ball to him in tight positions and know he‚Äôll be able to keep it. Romero is obviously a far better passer than Sanchez too of course. It‚Äôll definitely be interesting to see how Lenglet and Davies battle for the starting LCB spot

i definitely think the fact that son continues to receive the ball in tight spaces/with his back to goal, which is clearly a weakness of his, is more an issue with the system than with him as a player. just trying to think of what simple changes would get the best out of him with the squad we have.",,Jesus fucking christ.

\- First half, Wolves had 50% possession but were better at moving the ball, better at moving quickly, ran out of ideas as soon as they got anywhere near our box.

\- We were slow, lack of Romero mean a lack of ideas/options in bringing it out of the box and both midfielders didn't move the ball quick enough or decisive enough.

\- Despite Wolves ""dominance"" in the first half, they had a grand total of 2 shots on goal, no real saves for Lloris, for what's it's worth, at end of game, they had 3 shots (so 1 extra in 2nd half) and again no saves for Lloris.

\- We had Kane hit the bar, two shots from Son (mishit and side netting), one opportunity where Perisic could should have shot, the one where Richarlision got into box (and live it looked like he was badly fouled), what did they have?

\- In the 2nd half we changed the tempo, we brought on Richarlison & Bissouma, Bissouma allowed us to drop to 3-5-2v and manage out the game.

I don't blame him personally for any of the struggles. He can only go in and do what he's asked to do. 

However, what he's being asked to do seems too often beyond him for a while now. I'm also not saying he can *never* have a positive impact but in my opinion it's not happening nearly reliably enough or often enough to justify the negatives we've seen for most of the down stretch.

I also want to be clear, the whole Son thing is only like 30% of my thinking. The bigger issue is perisic has been woeful defensively and isn't doing enough in the attack to justify it.","Except for missing the best of the CBs and swapping two wingbacks who don‚Äôt defend. Last year should be evidence that Conte is capable of organizing a defense when all are available, if you look at the goals, despite Porro‚Äôs poor defending, three could have been stopped if Dier and Tanganga were replaced with actual top quality defenders (and in the case of Tanganga we have one he‚Äôs just suspended).","Can't really see why he's getting blame for the 3rd goal, it was a deflection that took it near post, alot of keepers wouldn't save that",Purely on the manager.

In games where he can use his intensity well and scrap a lot, he‚Äôs terrific, but in games that require composure and grace, he‚Äôs an absolute liability. The team wants to play quick transitions, and so he is constantly trying to make something happen, and ends up taking risks that aren‚Äôt warranted, when a calmer head might slow things down a moment to give the team respite.

I honestly would love to see Skipp integrated a little more sooner rather than later, because I feel he has a lot of PEH‚Äôs intensity but is possibly a better decision maker on the ball, and can play that #6-come-#8 role a little better in certain games.",,Tomori‚Äôs foul on Mount was in the box so there is precedent for a red for a soft foul in the box.,"Kulusevski will be perfect there if we have 3 in the midfield to provide defensive balance.  
Spence is a naturally attacking RWB who would also thrive in a 352.  
Doc will also be at his best when allowed to attack the box from a 352.   
It's Conte's stubbornness and his love for Emerson which has been holding us back and making you buy his shit excuses like Doc isn't fit, Spence isn't ready, etc. etc.",,"Key differences:

1) Emerson has consistently been playing with a wide forward on his side (Richy or Deki) to occupy defenders and make space for his runs; Doc didn't have that today

2) When playing with Emerson, on the rare occasion that the opposition decides to acknowledge his presence, he sends the ball out or loses possession. Though he didn't get forward much (see #1), Doc was able to retain possession well and have nice interchanges with the midfield under pressure

Put Deki (or even Richy) back in, and give him a run of games and Doc will show he's miles better for this team","I mean not that it's that bad because fuck other fans, but also that that season made us villians for almost every other team due to the narrative.","handy is 2-0 win , this is just the number","It was a hard fought point but we also got lucky today. We still need to reinforce, RWB is still a problem area and we could also use another wide attacker.",Definitely Emerson's fault there. He should've subbed himself off.,this better be our wake up call,Would much rather have a wingback who can effectively contribute in attack. Doherty did more in his cameo than Emerson‚Äôs shown all season.,"It's not cult like behavior, it's logic

\- Son has 6 season's of product, 4 bad games doesn't change that, you need to earn a place, you also need to know a small bad run doesn't automatically get you out. e.g. If Hugo has 3 bad games, would we be talking about Forster? you know the answer is no.

\- Additionally Richarlison (in Conte's mind) probably hasn't picked up our way of playing completely yet.

We have 6 games in the next 18 or so game, Richarlison will get his start regardless of Son's form so nothing to see here ..",I got about halfway through the ‚ÄúTLDR‚Äù,I can see Chelsea going for him if aubameyang doesn‚Äôt work out

A coach really is all about passing their energy onto the players at the end of the day. I think it's very likely Conte himself is dealing with depression and is struggling to muster the same energy he once had before the stream of serious tragedy he's had in the last 3 months of his life.

Hard to blame him really. It's hard enough going to work when you've lost someone close to you, the stress of having to turn form around for a club that's in a bit of a crisis while under the microscope of 2023 media must be incredible. But football is football. It moves on with you or without you.

Feels like when Stellini and Mason are in the players are just a bit more calm and relaxed and are playing with a bit more freedom and instinct. How it seems to me at least.","not gonna happen, Conte makes his tactic over preseason and then refuses to deviate from it, even when it fails","Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Lloris is directly responsible for a handful of dropped points this year, and he has no business starting.

But sit him against City, in my personal opinion, would not be likely. Against a team that pushes forward their defense, in Conte's tactics of counter attack (especially against these teams) probably the biggest weapon is pace. 90% likely Conte puts Son in starting 11. The thing about today's match too, our game only started to pick up after Son induced the red with his pace. That's what you call a game changer. Before then, none of our players stood out. Not Kane, not richarlison, not perisic, especially not the midfield. I'd reckon he gets a break after the City game",Have you seen our upcoming match schedule? There is no shortage of minutes in the coming months. Richarlison will get the start soon enough.

I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of girls while my thoughts drift back to Harry. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry.

Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing.

Bruno was the exception to the rule. Almost everyone else, including Son, Moussa Dembele, and Eriksen took time to settle in the EPL",I got downvoted for saying that we‚Äôre worst off starting Forster over Lloris when he was in bad form.

Son's weaknesses are that he sucks in tight spaces, so you can't have Perisic move up and try to cross to a Son that's hogged by 3 defenders in the center, or have Perisic moce up and Son play behind him.

It's just not clicking right now, and a team that at the start looked like they'd be happy to keep the score low ended up growing in confidence when we couldn't hurt them, and beat us 2-0.

Conte: ????

--

The people know the truth. #BringBackNES",Yeah he's renowned for his forward passing and carrying the ball and try to break lines at Barca. His problem at Barca was he always had to play in a very high line and he wasn't good enough while tracking back. Always figured he'd be great in a team who don't play such high lines. Seems like that was right.

I don‚Äôt get why Conte is so reluctant to sub",I think the real problem is the lethargic way the players played today.

Also, what about the ""It is better to fail aiming high, than to succeed aiming low""? Seems like you're aiming at the wrong thing bud. This is about us. Arsenals success is about them. So let them hold it over us. Then it shall give us more motivation for the future, without damaging the clubs resources and reputation further.","He wasn't great, I don't think he was the reason we lost tho, so we shouldn't be blaming him. That's my point.","How many tough years do we need? Were the last 3-4 years not tough enough?

Even without considering the imminent loss of Kane, it's all over. From an incredibly promising position, with a young team full of talent on the cusp of glory, Levy has overseen an almost inconceivable run of awful decisions.

Maybe if we tried to actually win football games more regularly wed win more football games? i dunno, crazy concept. I rather we have some deficiencies in how we play than just sit back and expect dier and sanchez to be perfect for 90 minutes. It makes no sense  


We have amazing forward talent that we dont play into because of Conte, not because of the players",,Agreed. I thought we settled down and we were moving the ball well after the initial Salah goal but the Dier mistake made it seem like we had a worse first half than we did.,Without substance? Are you blind bro,Diogo Costa,"Sure, the lines are right. He would be offside as he has to be behind the ball and not Emerson, however, the ball takes a significant touch off the defender. He cannot be offside. Insane that is just ignored.

Other than that he had alot bad touches.,"Jesus had made 5 fouls at that point with 0 cards. 

I know Emerson's tackle was silly, but it wasn't a red card. He's probably been sent off for 2 reasons. 1) it's easier to send him off at the Emirates. 2) because of the critiquing of the Chelsea performance.

You can't hide behind the unneccessary nature of Emerson's foul and say that alone justifies the red card. It's absolutely silly, but it's not a red card. Not when we've seen lesser tackles this season, with this raised tolerance, go unpunished.

Sessegnon vs Southampton was probably worse and even that was a deserved yellow.",,Totally agree that Conte will never use a traditional 10 but out of curiosity I would love to see one in his system to help break down low blocks. With our WBs running hot and cold it would be useful to have more options in the middle of the pitch.,Yea man first half especially couldnt make a single pass in midfield‚Ä¶ against the worst club in the league,I know Perisic was kinda bad on his 1 appearance on the right but I think we should try it 1 or 2 more times just to see if it was an off day and we can get it to work.

I remember when Conte came, one of the things he said was essentially that if you can't win, then just make sure you don't lose. We didn't lose.

We play so much better when we're attacking directly - and using any other tactic is a complete waste of time and energy.",Why are you so upset lmao,"How can you say that not making top 4 will only be for one year? The exposure and revenue from champions league is immense. Also might be critical to holding certain player like Kane and Son. 

If we drop this year next year only gets harder. What about when Newcastle spend big on reinforcements. What if Chelsea get into a good swing. United don't look like slowing down anytime soon. Nothing is guaranteed but this is potentially our best shot at champions league for a while if all of the above goes against us. 

It's horrible to see arsenal at the top but fuck it. I'm more interested in where Tottenham finish than where arsenal do.

He's got good deep crosses so I understand the logic particularly because Sanchez isn't exactly great either. But idk if he has the anticipation of Romero to push that far up.

Doesn't matter if they are in the 3rd division, we find a way to make it hard.","Yeah I agree we‚Äôre very reliant on counters and set pieces I‚Äôd add, and the issue is that recently teams are locking up Kane and son in our attack way more so we struggle to break through earlier in the game, it‚Äôs only when we‚Äôre ahead and they‚Äôre forced to attack and can‚Äôt lock down Kane and son / Deki that we do well",His first touch and shots have also declined (minus vs Leicester) so it‚Äôs not just positioning.,"Game changed when Conte went to 4 at the back, before that we weren't even in the game.

Games actually gone,"What about his CB partner for Argentina, Lisandro, who was excellent",,"Not at all, his runs into the box are very threatening and what helped Son shine today.","The two man midfield wasn't horrendous though as it allowed us lots of counter attacking opportunities, to which we created our goal from.

Richarlison made a big mistake at 1-1 just after the penalty where he tried to feed it to the 6 yard box instead of the edge of the box where we had an unmarked man.

Today's errors were the judicial system allowing a rapist to play, Lloris' worst GK mistake of his entire career and Emerson Royal.",,Why do people keep acting like I'm saying Doherty is a shit player in general? I'll openly say I don't rate him but all my comments are solely about his performance today,Comfortably?? That was about as close to being offside as it possibly could be without actually being offside,"Because he is asked to play differently to accommodate Perisic. Watch him without the ball and you're gonna see him playing in the hole between their defenders and midfielders with his back to goal looking to receive a pass and send it forward. 

Last season he played more on the shoulder of the last defender in the channel between two defenders. So when Kane drops deep he makes that run and Kane finds him with a through ball. They are not doing that this season",Somebody needs to give Tuchel an attitude adjustment.,"Kind of obvious, but this is a good point you made- we might have been frustrating, but we have not lost.... until today. 

After this loss- Conte is not going to sit idly by and announce the same XI.  I guess Son being subbed off so early means he will probably start, but among the other remaining questionables, not so sure.","Runners playing more entertaining style with the results to back it up, things I would have never said before.",All those Frenchmen around messed with his head.,You‚Äôre acting like all ppl say is ‚Äúx player is not playing well.‚Äù The nonsense is much dumber and more hateful than that lol,"Deki and Son needs to support Kane and Kane needs to actual attack some balls. 

Richarlison did it brilliantly yesterday he just waited for Kane to win / lose a duel and hung around to pick the ball up and when he did he calmed it down the press from wolves died and we carried on. 

In the first half Kane barely did any defending at all, he just walked around not attacking any loose balls and when it got to him he tried to start a counter and failing every time. 

I get that Conte might be worried about the Emerson/Sanchez side but Deki was so far back yesterday that he was never around to contest the balls when we played past the wolves press.","I‚Äôve got 4 mate, been rotating between them but still no luck"
519,"At this moment, so is Son unfortunately","Just shit conviction from the squad to compete in anything that's not the prem or cl which is wild considering how long it's been since a cup. 

Those bench players should be doing a Bryan Gil and throwing everything at it to show they deserve minutes but instead well... I can't tell if it was hubris or disinterest but it's just pathetic either way.

Also I reckon this weaker side was partly due to playing shit in the cl and creating a massive task for the return leg",The fact you have to come to the opposition team‚Äôs sub to justify anything is hilarious. Fuck off back to your sub.,Scarjo as son maybe?,Bournemouth going to do us a solid. I can feel it‚Ä¶,"I want Conte to drop Son, so we will all see it‚Äôs not Son‚Äôs problem. Let‚Äôs sell him","It's easy to say now ""oh they're just better"". But think back to the end of last season - overtook them to secure CL, cash injection announced, prospect of full preseason under Conte.... Not even the most pessimistic doom-monger alive could have predicted things going from that to this. Don't know how you can casually write it off like this, it's been an absolutely disastrous course of events",I feel Sonny needs to develop another aspect of his game (kind of like how a pitcher in baseball starts working on his accuracy and movement on his pitches when they start losing power and velocity),,,,"Okay now I agree with you. Constantly slowing down pace, passing backwards etc, but definitely better than first half",,THAT SHOULD BE THREE 90th MINUTE WINNERS IN A ROW,"That might be fatigue in fairness, think he's played every game this season. Hopefully once Romero is back we can try a Davies-Lenglet-Romero backline so Dier can rest","Thank you. Excited to check the highlights. (For him, not the outcome üôÑ)",,"Yeah people are going to take this as us being dominant but Liverpool are actually incredibly shit and we should've beaten them today.

Can't wait to go to Anfield and get dominated after having missed this chance to take points off them.","This match showed that so much to me. Sanchez defended terribly, Emerson completely at fault for their second goal as he didn't track his runner in the box. As soon as Conte put in Dier to solidify the right side of the defense and Bentancur, the match turned around. The drop off from the normal starters is really obvious when the squad can't handle Bournemouth without a full strength lineup.",You‚Äôd be so disappointed if he comes. He‚Äôs too raw,I did that cos I won ¬£200 with that as well then it was disallowed ‚Ä¶,"Exactly, they actually have a cohesive press and made it hard for us to get out. Conte still hasn‚Äôt implemented a decent press into our team, it‚Äôs so easy no matter who we play for the opposition to play out through us, and we basically never win the ball back high up. I‚Äôm personally so sick of it",,good bot,Conte said before the game Lucas' injury isn't looking good.,,He's played 90 with Ireland tbf. But he wasn't great in those games considering the rustiness! Defo improved today though! üáÆüá™,"At the speed Son was moving he probably did look offside - and the linos are supposed to call closer ones again this season, I believe.","He didn‚Äôt play well because he was being used as an attacking midfielder trying to link plays. 

The thing is, Son is at his best when he is used at the top of the pitch and uses his precise shooting during counterattacking situations to obliterate his xG.

That‚Äôs the role he played in the Leicester game and hence why he played well. Now he‚Äôs back to being a midfielder and hence why he looks out of form.",Tuchel is such a pound shop klopp,Not the first game Conte's done that.,Shit game,This season*,Or it's also nice to have some positivity around the threads and club. We all aren't required to be miserable all the time. This is the best spurs have played in 3 seasons at least. People pretending like we haven't won a single match bc we aren't up 4-0 by the 7th minute every game is idiotic and annoying to the people actually trying to enjoy this ride to the top that conte is just now beginning here,"The aim isn't to look great every match, it's to get the most points over the season.

It's early in the season and we're playing mediocre and getting most of the points, that's a very good sign.",I have his galactic 3rd kit from last season ;)

Shite competition. Would rather focus on winning a real trophy, qualifying for CL, etc",,"Pure reactionary take. They recently beat City and Napoli, they aren't automatically a low-table team just because they aren't in 100% form every game atm. They are still a top team, they're just inconsistent rn.","What still amazes me is that yes, Bentancur is our best player right now, and you can see it directly, but you could in the past when he was out. And think about how we've struggled with Kulu out.

Was last winter our best window in recent memory?",I‚Äôd rather just bring Juan bernat for a few years,Shut up Colton,It‚Äôs because we dwell in the box and then have zero ability to play out of the back so the ball never leaves our half. Can‚Äôt beat the press to save our lives but supposedly we‚Äôre built to counter attack.,,Yep agree.,Lucas rwb lets gooo,,Our best run of form was Doc and Kulu working together.,Yeah I'm not sure why some of the calls are so strict still. They specifically said halfway through last season that extremely close calls should wait until a VAR check.,Son had shit touches and dribbles in that Leicester game when he got subbed in. Nobody brings that up. Because he did the hat-trick. And I say use him for what he does best which is taking shots. I admit today his shots were bad tbf but still he is a way better finisher than a provider.,That's what i was waiting for. That's what it's all about,Wasn't son the only one subbed and regularly subbed off by conte since he took over? Kane on the other hand I agree with you,I thought we were blazing the first half. And then we sucked ass in the second. Whatever I‚Äôll take a point but that really sucks. It‚Äôs like we can‚Äôt score goals anymore,"I was watching with family and I said at the start of the game ""what's wrong with Lloris""? In the tunnel he looked out of it, like not interested, he was often looking downwards outside of greeting some of the OM players. Then when he started making the crazy decisions like the punch and throw and I was convinced something was going with him. Like the Frenchmen has a history of mistakes but these were terrible decisions rather than mistakes. Anyway complete speculation but I was jk he was having issues with his wife or something to be acting like he was. (hopefully not the case and just an off day)","Got battered? Haven‚Äôt lost yet pal. There are no easy games in the premiership, and while I agree we haven‚Äôt been playing particulary well in these games, we still have a lot of gears left. Good thing: 10 points from a possible 12 despite players such as Son and Kane are yet to fine tune their form. 
The team played a lot better after Conte came in last season, so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not too happy with a lot of what he‚Äôs seen so far.",Perfectly fine to criticize him. If we want to challenge for anything we need him to be more consistent,I also noticed some of this happening on the break when it seemed like neither were making movements that they thought the other would be making
521,Everyone who wants Conte to stay needs to know that this guy was his brilliant plan all summer. He was the first player we signed like contes entire plan relies on him.

Feel like the more frustrated he gets the less of a team player he is.

Kane should have given him a couple of penalties at the end of last season to become top scorer. I feel that deep inside Son would have rightfully resented Kane for that and so his desire to be connect with him has subsided.","Really sucks and felt like a loss, but let‚Äôs be positive people.

I forgot about the second one.,Fuck off yank.,"No. It's time to rotate him out for Richarlison/Spence. I'm sure Son will get his form back in mid season.

Another thing would be to bring in a seasoned campaigner like Perisic although I can't think of any who would be an improvement beyond Moura.

Saying that the first half I think we looked pretty good. The first goal was a decent one, and bar Doherty sliding in and not getting the ball, I can't really put it down to a massive error on our part. After that, we got skinned for pace on the break, and our defence got turned way too easily.

The midfield already gets overrun with two mids.Dropping one more will literally open the midfield to the other team.

What the average fan sees as ""defensive"" or ""attacking"" management is actually just different approaches to how a manager wants to attack certain zones on the pitch, to create and occupy space, and to transition from defense to offense and vice versa. No approach is inherently offensive or defensive; it's just that the result often is perceived that way.

For a counter example, Quique Setien is considered a disciple of Cruyff's total football, yet at Barcelona he was accused of playing ""possession for the sake of possession"" (which is the media's way of saying that it's cautious and boring for this ""style"" of football) and lost to Bayern Munich 8-2. This was the season when Barcelona brought in Greizmann, Braithwaite, and others who did not fit the system but was bought by Bartomeu. Setien is now managing at Villarreal, who are sitting at 7th right now, which is a respectable position for their budget.

A manager can definitely get their tactics wrong, but it's not due to being ""defensive"". To me that term makes no sense and no coach would be able to get their pro coaching license for thinking in such a way.",Don't let football dictate your life.

As much as I love these players it is time to blow this whole thing up, which we needed to do in 2019, but refused to do so and blamed it on Poch instead.  


The issue will be if we can get a manager (assuming Conte doesn't want to be here for this complete rebuild that we need) that can actually build the club back up and be given the time to do so.

None of this has been good news for the centre backs who have ended up facing waves of attacks and counters. As the pressure invariably builds the potential for defensive errors increases until they eventually become inevitable. 

I've lost count of the number of times this season alone where we've been praying for the half time whistle because we've abandoned any hope of getting control of the game.

You're misremembering IMO.

Dier has been told to push up when we have possession in the last few games, its what he did against City last week as well.

The reason the break happens for the 2nd goal is that Davies receives the ball, Perisic is already 20 yards ahead on the left hand side being marked and Davies gets pressured quickly.

Davies panics and just lazily plays the ball into the middle of the pitch, instantly giving them a turnover and the break because Dier is moving up as he has been told to do.

That was the goal where they just pass it through to the Leicester player who breaks.

&#x200B;

The 3rd goal, was Davies passing out wide to Perisic, who tries to do a little flick around the defender pressing him but messes up, who then passes to Ihnenacho, who gets 1vs1 with Dier.

There is no 3vs1, Perisic doesn't even start tracking back, Davies is marking Leicesters attacker on the other side who Perisic should have tracked back and Porro is too far on the right side to mark Maddison, who Tanganga picks up.","We scored twice, should've been 3.

(I don't know why Conte hates Tanganga)

I don't think that back 3 are the problem, to me the problem is with the tactics. When you sit back so deep and absorb pressure, because we're so close to our one goal, and mistake opens up a significant risk. Then, given Lloris's poor distribution, and Emerson's poor ability, and the fact that 3 forwards are out & one exhausted, we are not breaking the lines.

A fullback who passes Sonny the ball instead of consistently crossing it into the box. 

Everything changed this season: Kane moved further into the box and the midfield has no creativity. Perisic was brought in to spam crosses into the box. No one's position on the team changed as much as Sonny's did during the offseason. You don't go from EPL golden boot winner to getting the least touches on the team. 

A good manager assesses the strengths of the team and makes the team work around him. Sonny's season hasn't been good but Spurs fans are deluding themselves if they think Sonny is the reason the season is panning out the way that it is.

The argument that ""they're only winning because everyone else is shit"" only makes sense if that team is having an average season but staying on top because everyone else is having a below average season.

Arsenal are on track for 50 points at the midway point. This is an incredible tally that is not reliant on anyone else being crap because they are winning their games. They're NOT dropping points. Leicester spent the first half of that season below City and even Arsenal at some point, and a collapse of all usual title challengers in the second half kept Leicester on top (as they kept drawing and losing a fair amount of games)

Ramsdale also doesn't play well every game. Arsenals clean sheet record is not great, but their defence in generally very good. Once again missing the forest for the trees thinking a GK can be responsible for 47 points in 18 games.

Arsenal also lost one of the talisman in Jesus who everyone thought was the key to their game and expected them to drop off post word cup without him. Turns out he was not. With ESR and Jesus eventually coming back at some point this season they're just going to be stronger

Arsenal have also been unfairly fined by the FA for something all teams do. In the Newcastle game they were denied a big legitimate penalty and ended up dropping 2 points. So not sure where you are getting this ""big calls go their way"" narrative

You say he's a 'win now' manager, but he has repeatedly stated in interviews that the club is several seasons away from challenging for a title, so he obviously isn't thinking exclusively about winning right now... but is still refusing to develop our youth.

People have invented this mythical figure of a 'backed' Conte to explain why he can't get anything out of the squad he has available to him right now. But that's an illusion. Conte was given money and alongside Paratici invested poorly.

Imo a #10 makes no sense at all with Kane playing the way he does, plus it leaves what is already an undermanned midfield even more exposed.

What's changed?",Common WM W,"What team puts Ronaldo, Messi, salah etc on the bench becauae they have poor games early in the season. None lol.

Dont say we dont have anyone to replace him because we can just use the same members as if he was injured. 

Only time Kane got the shit was when he wanted to leave. Never when he was on a dry spell. 

Are you watching harry kane turned into one of our own quickly whilst Son extended his contract during that same time. 

This is why people are mad with the level of disrespect for Son. He just isnt viewed the same is he? Id understand if Son performs what 10 goals a season. But he won the golden boot, been player of the year for how many years. If him performing shit causes us to lose games then sure take him out but not while winning imo. 

Everyone gave so many chances to new players or benched players that they need time to adjust, made excuses for way more than 4 games and also while losing at that. 

Losing your position after 4 games will send a bad message to Son and if I was him, after giving my 100% to this club for 7 years, I would start having doubts.","Emerson has been solid and his development has been impressive.

Mourinho came and bought defenders for a back 4, Reguilon for example and midfielders for a midfield 3 in Hojbjerg.

&#x200B;

When he was fired, Nuno came in, even though he naturally prefers a back5, was told he had to play in a back4, brought in more players that play in a back4, Royal, Romero.

&#x200B;

Now we've switched to Conte who exclusively uses a back5, so Reguilon and Royal are pretty much useless for him now. Hojbjerg has been a star but he still works better in a midfield 3.

And with Contes system, it makes Sonny ineffective as he likes to run into space that Conte relies on the WBs like Perisic to cover.

Emerson is the safe option. He's defensive minded, fit and knows the tactics. Whereas Doherty has been injured and Spence doesn't know the tactics yet. Unlike Perisic who has been able to come in straight away. Lenglet has been forced into the team out of neccessity.

Now, is it the correct choice to sacrifice what your star attacker does best for an aging 33-year old wingback to play his game? I wouldn‚Äôt say anything if the tactic was working, but based on today, and even the way we barely won the games we did, it‚Äôs hard to see the validity of this tactic.

Spurs play with 3 CBs and two defensive minded CMs -- if Son believes he, as a forward, needs to drop deep, I think we have the root cause of the shitty attack we have: Son lacks form, confidence, and bravery.

We are so heavy in the back, there is no purpose of Son to be covering up back.

It's downright negative football, that mid-bottom table clubs use when trying to snatch a result when they know they are outmatched. 

They had the lions share of possession, because we let them, because we can't play balanced style? Forget trying to dominate possession, but at least play a balanced style that doesn't let them keep it?

Consequently we sit deep absorbing pressure of course they don't have good chances, that's the point, two lines of defences in pretty much all almost in the box cuts off any chance of passes going in for high quality chances. The counter to that is taking long shots because there's plenty space for it. Arsenal doesn't have the quality but today they got one. But the other more dangerous counter to it is taking it wide and low crosses in taking advantage of the number of bodies in the box to create a little bit of chaos, get a deflection, get a foot in things like that to nick a goal and that's what happened.

And really all the opponent needs to do is Nick that one goal, because after that a team that relies on this defensive negative football, will have to switch to a more open formation to go on the offensive to get the equaliser, which they obviously won't be comfortable with and thus more likely to concede another against the team that is just waiting for that to happen.

And players out of form aren't able to proprely execute them. Such as Son at the moment. He can't control the ball properly nor pass well at the moment. So, no, he can't properly follow expectations from Conte either.

Honestly probably 3-4 years of patience with a promising squad. Though the amount of years will truly depend on scouting and development speeds. Spurs had a legit shot to bring in Botman, Kim Min-Jae and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia for around the cost of Richarlison. Bringing in diamonds in the rough like Kulusevski and Bentancur is what took Spurs to the top. I'm entirely unsure as to why Spurs don't play to their strengths in scouting and recruitment. Even if Kane/Son left, having a core of Botman, Kim, Romero, Hojbjerg, Bentancur, Kvaratskhelia, and Kulusevski is competing for top 4 and still having an incredibly high ceiling. 

If Spurs wanted to be a ""big 6 club"" then they needed to spend the money on the player that fit their system, like Arsenal have. Spurs will consistently cheap out and either not pay the release clause or buy the lesser player. There are countless times that Arsenal stumped up the cash to pay for the player they wanted and Spurs just haven't and won't.

There's one instance where Perisic went for the volley instead of laying it off to Son who was open. But like I said this is a consequence of having a new team at the beginning of the season. Which is why we're relying on a lot of Kane headers for goals at the moment because it's the only thing that works quite consistently lol.

But when the same formation and players are playing diametrically opposed halves, and even they're staying in interviews that they don't understand why they're not starting matches better, i think we have to stop laying into Conte and pretending he can somehow magically make it all better with words. 

People talk about Conte as if he's asking the players to just sit there, play like shits and invite pressure for the whole match until it's too late. It's just not reality.

Contes system clearly isn't working with our team though and his inability to change that makes it more damning. His use of WBs and the way Sonny/Perisic work together negates everything that makes Sonny good.

His use of Strikers as target men that stay up front, negates Kanes ability to drop back and play blistering balls.

Having an argument in the comments with anyone suggesting we should rotate Richarlison into the starting spot is not ""defending Son"".  It is defending the ego of people who can't bear the thought that their fragile self-identity based on Son fandom could be bruised.  

Son is out of form and suffering.  We have a rotation player who appears to be in form, and absolutely loving football. Richarlison is smashing it.  Slot him into the starting position. Let Son come ripping off the bench as a super-sub, and get his spark and hunger back.

Exactly.  And his play on and off the ball is hurting the team, because he is out of form at the moment.

Source: him","This is something I have been saying for at least 10 years. I love 3-5-2 or 3-4-3, but ONLY if your wingbacks have very good midfield characteristics, very good at passing/crossing and doing triangles. If they are more in the defensive characteristics then it does not work because in this system the wingbacks become basically midfielders playing on the sides. It hurts when pressed because they get more responsibility of bringing the ball to the midfield and also on top of that you have one more backer in the team which, generally, are players with less capacity of having good passing.

I think Doherty can do it, but not Emerson for example.

At this moment I thing we need to go back having only 2 backers and one more guy in the midfield, and using the wingers more as defenders with occasional attacking functions.

Right now I think we need to go back to 4-4-2 until Kulu or Rick comes back, and bring back maybe Lucas do the midfield or someone else.

That's literally how Conte won with Chelsea, it's how his Inter team worked as well.

The issue is that we don't have the players for it, Kane is a great striker but he doesn't have the size that Lukaku or even Costa in his prime at Chelsea had to go 1-1 in the box and get the headers in.
Sonny can't receive a ball and dribble through players like Eden Hazard could.
Neither Hojbjerg, Skipp or Bentancur can play that role that Kante did in 2016, when he was almost like 2 Midfielders.

We're using a system built around players that do not have the skills for the system. I said it in the summer but if we were fully on board with Conte and his style, we should have sold Kane and Sonny, brought in someone like Lukaku and Zaha who both have the skills for the system.

We didn't and Conte should have stuck with the system he used last year, which used the skills of our players to their advantages but then it's not 'his system' anymore and he thinks his system is better than anything else.",His system relies on good ball playing CB's and besides Lenglet who's trash defensively and Dier once in a blue moon we have none,,,,Play a fucking 3 man midfield lmao.

Same thing Chelsea, United and Arsenal are doing. All these clubs have a philosophy that affects everything. We don't, not really. We switch between attacking technical football and defensive lol, some of the players we buy aren't even fit for the system. It's really disjointed.

If our recruitment strategy was as good as other clubs we wouldn't be in this mess. Not Conte's fault we cheap out on good players, but it is his fault that we struggle against any team that presses us.

728,"Honestly, it‚Äôs the wingbacks. While on paper we should have one of the most terrifying attacking teams in the world. I figured once Conte gets the wingbacks of his choice, we‚Äôd be flying. 

Today we played both of his proffered WBs yet all they can manage to do is cross the ball into an ultra marked Kane where the ball, quite easily, gets cleared away. 

I know we knew him coming in would mean lots of crosses but it just doesn‚Äôt work against lower sides that have no problem sitting back and knocking Kane around a bit. 

And with our next few weeks of playing lower sides coming up, Contes inability to adapt to these teams that will just sit in their own box no problem, might actually end up being quite detrimental. 

The Wingbacks need to adapt from touch line hounds to actually cutting inside to wreck havoc, which if feels they both can do. But if Conte fails to adapt these tactics and we continue to lose to bottom half opposition. It‚Äôs time to go.

Plus Son and Kulu have been incredibly blunt this season and the signs of that changing for the better look incredibly slim under these tactics.

Perisic was a mixed bag. The free kick assist will get all the headlines. He also had a nice low cross across the vos early that should have gotten more. But defensively he was terrible. Fully responsible for their goal by being out of position. People want to blame Sess, but they had switched sides by that point.

But Sessegnon also had a poor game defensively and could have cost us the game a few times. Didn't provide much going forward either, and deserved to be hooked at half time.

Happy with Lenglet's goal, but he is not a player who can handle that CCB role. He isn't a defensive leader, tries to look silky and makes too many dangerous passes.

Lol - as if he should be guaranteed a starting spot for life? We spent 60 million on Richarlison, he has competition for his place, he will be benched and on this form he deserves it. If he then does well off the bench, he wins his place back - it's how a meritocracy works.

No one has a god-given right to a starting spot - not Sonny, not even Kane. We started Kane because we had no backup for him - we do now in Richy so expect even Kane to sit games out. 

As for Ronaldo, Messi and Salah.....think De Bruyne, Mahrez,  Foden et al. Everyone in City's front line gets rotated, and the result is an incredible level of depth where everyone is happy to play their part in getting them to titles. 

Aim for that, not for some strange 'Sonny always plays rarglbh' system.","You think so? I always felt like he had dribbles, need to see more in Lilywhite. Maybe not to the degree the role would require, but he can pick a pass with the best. Deki also fancies himself as a 10 and gets stuck in on tackles so it may not even be a personnel change.",

We needed a starting CB and RWB so badly, this match proved it when Sanchez/Dier and Emerson were asked to progress the ball & failed",,"If Kane had quality competition back then I would definantly have liked to see him on the bench if he had a poor patch of form or looked knackered. The problem is we didn‚Äôt. Now we have a ¬£60 million player that is top quality. Kane hasn‚Äôt looked great so far either, but he‚Äôs scored four and has looked sharper than Sonny.

Sonny is no doubt a superior player to Richy, and I have no doubt Son will be back firing at all cylinders soon enough. However, in our first four games Richy has offered more than Sonny playing significantly fewer minutes. With all the games coming up Son will be rested regardless, might as well give Richy a start against West Ham IMO.


Besides that, not sure if you‚Äôve noticed, but Ronaldo is currently starting on the bench every weekend these days. Salah has also been benched several times in past.

Did NOT want to lose.,Couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. We look so sluggish and not only today. We‚Äôre not creative enough and it hardly looks like anyone is trying as hard as Perisic.

Last year we played with our CMs pressing further up the pitch, Kane was dropping back to collect turnovers from them and then releasing Deki and Sonny.

Like, watch our 3-2 vs City last year and see the differences.

First goal came from Kane dropping deep, Sonny hugging the touchline and then being set off.

Second goal came from Sessegnon running inside towards the box, receiving a ball from Kane dropping deeper, letting Son stay out wide who he passes to, who then cuts in and gets a cross to Kane running into the box.

We had a goal disallowed, which came from Kulusevski hugging the touchline, with Emerson sitting in.

Third goal, comes from Bentancur and Hojbjerg pressing high up the pitch, Bentancur puts it wide to Kulusevski who is once again, hugging the touchline, whilst Doherty is going inside, into the box.

&#x200B;

And this wasn't a one and done match, its how we were playing last year.

Sess/Doherty attacking the box, letting Sonny and Deki hug the touchlines and come inside, cutting past defenders, either scoring or assisting.

You're making an argument right now that isn't up for debate and then trying to apply that same argument to a different timeline with the benefit of hindsight.

Yes, Spence deserves a chance now. That is a different argument to the one you've been making where you're implying Spence should be in the team ahead of Emerson before now based off of nothing.

I'm not loyal to Conte and if the results and how we look on the pitch don't change then we can't continue with him, but he's unarguably a world-class manager in his prime. 

Either:

a) Something has happened with Conte to suddenly make him revert to *not* being a world class manager;
b) The players aren't good enough, or not capable of playing how they're trained and instructed to; 
c) Our tactics are easily nullified and have been figured out by opposing managers; or
d) There's something intangible that's inherent in the club, separate to either players or manager, that prevents us from competing.

Watching the mistakes, poor play and lack of consistency from the players is painful and they've had ample time to bed in. It's probably a combination of everything above in varying proportions, but several of the core players have consistently looked below-par under a succession of managers. 

We need a rebuild. Several aren't good enough, some aren't suited to the current tactics, and some of our best players are going to be declining with age soon or are already declining. 

For me it needs a project manager and a big squad overhaul in tandem. But the Poch-era fans are spoilt; many came on board when we looked like world-beaters and won't have the patience for dropping out of CL or letting the gap to our rivals widen.

Perisic jumps straight in knowing the formation. Lenglet has been forced in as the only fit LCB. Doherty has had fitness troubles and Spence is new, so Emerson, who played a lot pre and post Doherty injury is the safe bet.

I just don't see how sacking Conte is the answer here. Son and Kane are a shadow of themselves right now, the defense is conceding at relegation levels, the wingbacks (which are crucial to Conte's system) offer nothing in the attack.

Consider that worse players than Haaland or VVD have gone for much larger transfer fees than those two. Seems irrelevant to fixate on how much he cost when he's had 4 games to integrate.

Also consider Haaland and VVD started right away as they were clear improvements and/or filling in vacant roles (City had no CF and Liverpool no one close to VVD in quality). This is a depth signing that may take a starting spot. Man City and Liverpool make those kind of signings too. Give it time and he will at worst provide essential cover to rotate or cover injury and he may take a starting role.

For me, criticizing Conte‚Äòs ‚Äútactics‚Äù with no reference to the fact that it works when Kulu is in is also suspect, because our record is still good and has been under Conte.

What this reveals to me is not that Conte‚Äôs tactics are bad but that our squad is too fragile to do his system due to a lack of depth.

Maybe a 4-4-2 would help. Maybe it would undermine a lot of their training. I‚Äôm not sure. But whatever else, we need Kulu back.",,,,,"He has two jobs. Attacking and defending. He did part of that right.

How can you even argue at the definition of fine? We know hes shit going forward and yet he was still involved in 2 goals against Southampton despite that. He'd been sound defensively up until the recent games. That is fine. I guess you believe he was poor despite being good defensively and poor going forward.

Why are you mentioning Doherty? He's been lacking in fitness this season and suffered setbacks. Doherty being better than Emerson before his injury, doesn't suddenly mean that Emerson can't have been fine himself? Doherty was the best RB/RWB itl at that point and was so good going forward, he was better than Emerson, I've never denied that, but that's irrelevant if he's not been matchfit.

You're putting words in my mouth. Emerson being a 6-7/10 for weeks and weeks, being steady going forwards despite impotence and satisfactory defensively was passable. Especially given the external factors at play with Doherty's fitness and Spence learning the system.

I'm getting fucking tired of you simply not reading my words, so I will spell it out for you.

Doherty when in form last season was electric, but he got injured and has suffered since. Emerson since then has been, for the most part, okay. Nothing more, nothing less. Does that mean I'm happy with him to play there for good? No, but given the circumstances with the other two RWBs, we had little choice. Spence hasn't played, like Bissouma, as Conte doesn't see him as ready.

If Doherty can come in and be anywhere near last season's level, he will start and deservedly so. Same goes with Spence. Neither of these mean that Emerson has been dropping 3/10s for months and should have been dropped immediately because that's a fucking lie.

You need to learn, saying Emerson has been okay and done a passable job, does not mean I'm saying he's world class and shouldn't be dropped. It's me saying that given he's been okay and there are other factors in play, that there's been no valid or justifiable reason to drop him UNTIL NOW.",,,,,First the manure bandwagonners got spanked and today this.

The way they usually set up against us at home counters our playstyle and makes it difficult to settle the ball given the physicality.

You really can't read can you. I have never once said that Bissouma and Spence aren't in the team as a result of match fitness, I've only said that about Doherty. Learn to read. I've said they're not in the team because according to Conte himself (I know right, the manager knows more than british-psycho) Bissouma hasn't grasped the system yet. His cameos reflect that as he's been extremely wasteful, He was shocking against West Ham. Simple assumption would indicate that the same is for Spence. Perisic knows the system so doesn't need time, whilst Lenglet has been forced into the team because Davies fractured his shin. Richarlison has had to wait his chance and has proven he understands the system and can be productive. 

Just so you know, those are the outfielders we've signed and I've gone into detail on every one and to why their fates are different, just so you can't say 'bUt wHAt abOuT LeNGLet??!1' like an idiot.

When should Emerson have been dropped out of curiosity? Genuine question seeing as though you're so adamant. Because last year he was our only fit RWB after Doherty. Doherty's issues have continued, you're not going to throw Doherty in at the start of the new season when he had virtually no minutes in pre-season after the injury. Nor will you throw in an untested Spence who also had no minutes in pre-season.

I'm so happy you're not in charge of the club, because you're a moron incapable of reading English.

They traded midfield overload for the ability to score, so it got them possession and really fuck all else.

\- If someone had been smarter in the zonal setup, they don't score the first.

\- If our defense doesn't get sucked out of position chasing a press, they don't score the second.

If we had gone there and played a low block against them, we would have probably done a smash and grab win.

Instead we went toe to toe, yes, it meant we were hanging on at moments but we played them at home and if Son or Kane had a better day, we win (their players missing is normal, they have no elite level finisher)

Watch them play a shit team who sits and they will struggle ..",Agreed but the other players looked like statues for that 2nd goal. For the first one there was not much movement too.,Both Chelsea and West Ham could be beaten but not with this passive af game plan.,,"Much better than your ""fuck off yank""","I mean the point of depth is so that son doesn‚Äôt have to start every game especially when he‚Äôs not in form, so yes I‚Äôd start Richarlison some games",

Laughs in Emerson Royal.

Mate do you think it's easy to change everything that you've done to become successful and watch everything that enabled your success to not be there? Conte is an incredibly stubborn manager and this Spurs team was built half-assed. Spurs don't have the quality that Conte wanted in his key positions because they don't believe he's a long term manager. Here's to hoping something at all changes in a positive direction.

I hope him and Son can start firing soon.,So quiet I forgot he played,"Apparently, sometimes a man just needs to calm his tits.

Deki was literally the best purchase in the entire league last season and why is that bc of the price. If we paid 70 mil I would expect more from him as well. Richarlson has never proven anywhere that he is good enough to replace son permanently and he is the most expensive signing is spurs history. We aren't competing against ourselves, we are competing against city, Liverpool, arsenal, and Chelsea. Every signing has to count when all those teams spend more money than we do every single window. Ive watched basically every minute of spurs games for almost a decade. We never spend and when we do it hasn't exactly worked out for us.

You can‚Äôt go full strength for 15 minutes and hope to win lol,,,,Best beer in the world. I‚Äôll die on that hill.,"Allowing yourself to be outnumbered is a sacrifice that can be made to have more numbers elsewhere on the pitch. But tactically it hasn't worked for us all year. 

What's happening is the lack of numbers in midfield and fullback tucking back make it so our midfielders get doubled, passing lanes blocked, and be dispossessed. This then takes them out of the game and now the opposition has the ball upfront and numbers to attack with. So often times our defense isn't actually overwhelming the oppositions numbers. 

Conte had this issue at Inter and went to a 3-5-2. But he prefers the 3-4-3 and has primarily stuck with that here","If he's a RB, try Royal as a RCB......can't be worse than as a WB. He's shown that he's better as a defender than an attacker.

Sess is WAY BETTER defensively, unreal we even have to discuss this. Perisic won ZERO duels vs saka in the NLD. Sess won a few but no one expected lloris to ltiearlly palm it in his own goal for teh one mistake sess made   


Sess also is way more direct and forces early balls in, he doesnt cut in and out and in and out before floating one to a set defence

It's too early to say this, but it almost feels like nobody is a contender with them.
2. Compared to the beginning of last season, we seem much better in pretty much every way. Compared to the end of last season, not so much. I'm not sure exactly what it is but it doesn't help that Son was at his best then and isn't at the moment. Having Richarlison off the bench looks like it'll be huge. He's got a great motor and seems to make the right decision most of the time. Big improvement over Lucas. 
3. Right now we are sorely missing Cuti and Bentancur. West Ham seems to have figured out at halftime that the players we had out today were never going to beat their press. This is really bad if other teams use a similar strategy against us. We need Bissouma to get some game time so he can get more polished. Today was rough but he has the best chance to be the press beater we need with the current injuries. Conte is not going to shy away from trying to invite pressure and it might be a recipe for disaster but it's also what gives us space in attack.
Perisic is the best crosser we've had in a while, but he does tend to eat up the space that Son likes to cut in from. If they can gel better that will likely be huge. I think what we're missing there is a lack of cutback passes. Son needs to adapt to not trying to get in behind but instead finding space in the box and waiting for the ball to come to his feet. As for Perisic, his crosses are great but they're always into the middle of the box, if he can start hitting cutbacks to Son at the edge of the box or just inside it I think we'll see some magic.
Overall, I think our signings look solid but need more time. Today was rough but a lot of people are overreacting, myself included at times. We have 11 points from 15 and are currently in 3rd place. I think we'd all be happy with that start going into the season

If you notice the amount of players this was taking up, Chelsea produced very little with the ball from open play but it but any Spurs chances were definitely smothered in return. 

Their game plan was working perfectly because they got their one goal and were choking the rest of the game.

The result is that if opposition isn't being overaggressive in possession, we're basically ceding them all the momentum.",,,,Richarlison at least,"If people are defending Son today it‚Äôs pretty much just a clear sign they don‚Äôt know what they are talking about. His confidence is at absolute rock bottom and he can‚Äôt create anything for himself or others even in 1v1 situations. He‚Äôs also the laziest of the front 3. 

He needs a reset and then to build his confidence back up. This has nothing to do with how good he was before and I don‚Äôt even doubt he can come good again, but this is a player in a genuine crisis of confidence that is only gonna get it back with some time out and maybe a new coach.","Ha that‚Äôs ok then.

I agree Conte's tactics do work although to be honest sometimes I think its not very difficult to counter it. But yeah, with a strong defence and Kulu back we can be much better. I cannot stress enough how important is to have Kulu back. He is the guy that changed the team last year and one of the responsible for our second half of the season to be so good.

Nothing about this indicated an improvement, and it took another set piece goal and last minute goal to win it. I know people will chastise me and tell me I'm being a twat, but I'm getting 'Poch in the CL final run' vibes, where everyone ignored what is in front of them (esp how bad we were domestically) because we scraped through to the final.

Teams are much more disciplined in moving across when the ball switches flanks and we don't really have the most creative wing-backs anyway.

Being honest, we have a bit of an injury crisis right now with both Deki and Richarlison out. It's hard to complain about having to rely on two world class players in Son and Kane but I feel Son hasn't been at it and we've really missed some creativity from the forward line.

Bissouma has looked a total shell of the player he was at Brighton. He's still the one I'm most hopeful for but he's looked incredibly disappointing.

Richarlison has been pure horseshit, just runs around falling over and can't even control a football. Getting him for that pricetag is the most idiotic transfer of all time.

Danjuma and Porro have just arrived, l literally said players can turn it around and this isn't final. But again, still bad for the time being. And in the case of Danjuma he's a loan, it's instant impact or no impact, he doesn't get time.

I don't know what Lenglet has to do with Sanchez/Tanganga/the pope or why you're comparing them. He has been mediocre at best. And another loan who needs to be judged on the short term.

We didnt have the players for Contes actual system last year, its why Sonny was so lethal, he was playing wide on the left because we had no proper LWB taking up that space.

Kane was dropping back deeper and providing the balls to Son, something that Conte doesn't want him doing in his system.

&#x200B;

Its only since the summer when we've been able to bring in WBs for Contes system like Perisic that we have reverted to it.

Perisic now attacks down the wing, not son, who now cuts inside. Kane is told to stay up in the box, dont drop back, wait for crosses.

Midfielders are now not pressing and letting players run onto them (Another part of Contes system), whereas last year, when we didnt have the personal, we were pressing with our players.

&#x200B;

Look at the comebacks we've made this year and its the same thing, we go behind using the system and then when we have to attack, our midfield starts pressing, Kane starts dropping deeper and Sonny starts getting wider and we look decent.

The comparison for me is not much the style, but finishing 1st in the group masks the obvious defects, similarly to how reaching the CL final masked how bad we looked from the middle of the season that year, despite ultimately reaching the CL final.

Some people still don't get why Poch had to go, and much of that is based on that CL run (""Poch got Spurs to the CL final and was sacked...."" being something I heard quite a bit from other fans ). Obviously there's relief and a buzz to be through now, but the fact we looked so terrible in the first half - especially in such a big game - doesn't entirely make up for rescuing a win via a set piece and last gasp goal in the second. That's not a one off, it's been like that all season.

But I guess it depends on if you're a results purist who'd be happy to risk playing like this all year, and genuinely think we can maintain getting results this way, or if you actually enjoy watching the individual games and would like to see some indication of an on the pitch improvement over 90 minutes, if that makes sense.",,,,,,"There‚Äôs a reason he‚Äôs on loan.

What other 2 obvious opportunities did we not score?,"I'm not in the dressing room, so I can only speak to what I observe in games.  That said, I don't think it is the same system.  We may line up in a similar way, but there was much less focus on widebacks providing the entry to the attacking zone in the prior season.  Watch the official video on youtube of all of his goals from last year.  There is a clear difference in how Son receives the ball between last season and this season.

Excluding the handful of outside the box curlers to the far post that Son is known for, the majority of his goals came from two areas.  1) Fast break attacks that put him into the box at speed, and 2) attackers entering the box to draw defenders and then either playing across to Son at the back post or allowing him to drop into space 10-12 yards out for a shot.

With the signing of Perisic over the summer and the games we have seen play out since, it has been more apparent that Conte is drilling our team to enter the final third through the wings and to then cross, take on their man to enter the box, or lay off to players more central to recycle.  There are a few problems with this change that affects Son's output.  Our wingbacks don't have the speed or confidence to beat their man and attack the net or put in a dangerous cross.  This slows our attack and leads more often to a backpass than a ball into a dangerous area.  We haven't seen Son and our wingbacks complement eachother, and rather have occupied the same space, drawing two defenders close and getting him the ball when both he and his outlet are already 80% closed down.  

You may see something different, but that has been my takeaway from this season.  If I were at the helm, I'd much rather do my best to get the best out of my superstars playing to their strengths than try to change their game.  At the half, I would have pulled Dier for Bissouma and transitioned to a 4-3-3.  Allowing our midfield to play off each other and progress the ball forward and provide service to our forwards.  Having Dier bolster the defense does nothing to stop opponents from entering our box and getting chances.  If they were a stone wall, it may be a closer call.  As it stands, it only leads to fewer touches for our front three and constantly having them track back deep to fill a void in our midfield defensively or receive a pass short from a midfield 2 that is outnumbered.","Yes, because you are only missing key points in your explanation -

1. Passing sideways. What are your proposed option to deal with a low block. Even when we have Kulusevski in the team, we still like to take the ball wide, so that either he can cut in or let dribble in the create a crossing oppurtunity.
2. deep block, we played majority of the game in their half, until the second goal went in.

Plan A for Conte's wingbacks is to stay wide and overlap while the wingers tuck in. This isn't an argument, it's just how his system operates.  Wingers play toward the middle of the pitch, looking to cut inside, while wingbacks stay wide and go past them into space. The winger then plays the ball wide to him or looks to cross inside to Kane or the other winger. It's tactically the wide CBs (Davies/Romero) who underlap in this system.

It wasn't coming off so Conte went to plan B and switched the shape by having Kulusevski stay as close to the touchline as possible whilst Emerson ran past him inside -- creating space for Deki to cut in than in the first half where his starting position was further toward the midfield. Key example of this change was his cross that Sonny put over the bar about 15 minutes into the second half.

He's scored goals and generally been very off on his passes/first touches in most games this season. The only thing he's been solid on are his poacher duties.

It‚Äôs supreme arrogance and stupidity to look at our history and point the finger at everyone else but us.

One of the key differentials for me as to the criticism we regularly receive is that it always fails to recognise that yes we seem to be having a game of two halves where in one half we play badly, but the evidence of the second half clearly shows what we're capable of. That's demonstrable that we're our own worst enemy but also our own saviours. We put ourselves in those positions.

I do maintain, though, that our general performance didn't warrant losing by two goals, mainly because on another day we'd have had at least one of our own by that point.

953,,"Maybe my opinion is unpopular but I really don‚Äôt think we rotated anything too much outside of Lucas? And then even then it probably should have been Danjuma instead which is still rotating.

The only players in the squad that haven‚Äôt been seeing regular first team minutes of late were Lucas and Davinson. Sarr is third choice of late and has been playing quite well, and we have to play Porro at some point, I fail to see why doing so against a rotated Championship side would be a bad time for him. Perisic has not been good but it‚Äôs not like he hasn‚Äôt been a regular starter all season.

So I don‚Äôt think this was some super rotated squad, more so let‚Äôs rest a few guys who have been playing a lot lately like Kane, Romero, Deki, Skipp. We should have more than enough squad depth to figure it out against rotated Sheffield.

1034,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,huh?,,"I'm one of those people 

our biggest problem today was the lack of ability to put someone on - in fact I think we made exactly one substitution?? 

the difference between us and a Liverpool or City is they have that depth - they can go to the bench or even start some alternate and they're not weakened by making that change - clearly we cannot do the same",,,,
1035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lol what?

Edit: sorry I didn‚Äôt know how bad it was. Forgive me",,"There were options to change something when we were being dominated.   Skipp, for one,  couldn't have played worse than Bissouma did today.

Now we have an issue where we *could* sign players now, but if we didn't manage to move every single bit of deadwood on *next* window we could be in some financial trouble and some players wouldn't be able to be registered for Europe.

When you are done, go look at the official highlights from Spurs (it's up on youtube. (freeze \~23 seconds in)

The issue is when the ball gets put deep

\- We have 5 players on the near side of Llloris, Chelsea has 1 in box, 1 on edge of box

\- They have 4 on far post side of Lloris, we have 4

The system failed, someone from the front post should have seen the Chelsea team setup and moved across to help both Son & Emerson.

So yes, Emerson could have made a choice to move out of his designated space to cover, Son could have once the ball cleared him pressed Koulibally or any of the 5 on near post side could have come over to help.

Zonal doesn't absolve players but it does make it harder to place blame, and my issue is that people see that, and go -> it's 100% Emerson's fault .. no, it just isn't.",,Did you want him to go out there and physically push the players forward or something? West Ham just stifled our ability to be able to play it out of the back. Simple as that.

1324,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Spence played right wing when he came on against Forest. Not all that wild of a suggestion when Conte's already used him in that very position.,,,,
1325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He had the first shot on target for us and it was a pretty decent strike. Why is he even being brought up is my point. There was no need for OP or anyone else to talk about issues at RWB when that wasn't the issue today.,,,,

Yes they let us have the ball in the first half but we carved them open several times where Sonny, Deki, Perisic, and Kane were running at their back line. 

We should have capitalized on that. 

But oh well.",,,,

Yes, he created chances. He wasn't great either but Son definitely contributed the least.",,,,
1353,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Doesn't mean they're always wrong? And my further proof the team was lax is PERISIC, AN EXPERIENCED PLAYER, still had his back turned to the guy taking the throw in whilst the ball was thrown. Look at the rest of the squad too, they clocked in too late.",,,,

1365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"He's got 1 goal this season, and that was a header that Kulu put on a plate for him. Could've had an assist vs Forest last game but he messed up the cross - luckily Richarlison bailed him out by actually putting a good cross in",,,,

Easily could've given him the opportunities to pass the ball to him but ghosted him. How can he score when they don't give them chances?

It doesn't matter what race or nationality you are, as a footballer you will get criticised for that. Son needs to improve. There is no demying that. But no one actually blaned him for the defeat. That was the fault of other individuals before Son. And the comments here reflect that.",,,,
1386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We had the same number of shots on goal and had much more possession than what they had. Yes I agree that if anything, they were slightly better but a draw isn‚Äôt exactly unfair lol.

Wether it hit his head first or not can be up for debate, but the if the refs say it did then the decision must be no handball",,,,
