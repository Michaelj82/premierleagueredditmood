Happy for him…seems like such a likable guy,"What ever pep saw in that second preseason since the world Cup, he needs to scrap that and go back to the drawing board! Cause we've been shit since","Absolutely fucking ridiculous. We were nowhere near our best but the second half was completely comfortable until that farce of a decision.

Saw this photo circulating, absolutely fantastic",Dias has to start the rest of the way. Incredible player,"I know Alvarez and foden don't provide that much stability compared to other players but with them, there is always an attacking threat lingering around the pitch. Add kdb to the mix, we can be very threatening. We have to find the right Balance between the players. I trust pep to do that.","KDB finally scoring, Foden back in form, Rodri resting, Haaland resting, Ake doing well, got a clean sheet. Good day overall.

On to Newcastle! Cmon City!","Bad performances all around. Grealish and Ake were decent but otherwise that was very poor. May as well be playing with 10 men when Haaland is on the pitch, but it's not his fault - the number of incisive runs that he makes that get completely ignored is ridiculous. I think only Kevin tried to play him in once and it didn't come off",Grealish deserved better. So happy for him. Would’ve been immense if we did our jobs.,"If today was a league match we’d be saying we ground out a result like champions 

We need to play better but I’ll take it. 

Ake is unrecognizable from what he was in his first season with us. Absolutely immense",The result is what it is.

Feels like it's been an age since we've beaten Liverpool.",That Gundo miss will haunt me in my sleep,"Our worst day versus their best. We don’t have a great record at Anfield, onto the next",I've never seen a player with the same work rate of Bernardo Silva he is truly outstanding,Can we talk about how great Ortega is,"What a ridiculous thing for the interviewer to say to Kev as he's giving him the MOTM award 'Do you feel you have answered your critics with that performance? Pep says he wants more from you'

He gives 100 percent every game, he's fatigued and still putting MOTM game-winning performances in. Piss off","It should have been 10, it should have been 10, you lucky bastards, it should have been 10!","Alvarez is everything you love in a teammate. Hardworking, never let a free space to the opponent, makes the runs when you have the ball, shoots or pass when he has to.  Fantastic player",Two ucl snooze fests in a row and it results in us topping the group. Huh,0-0 away after an early doors red without bringing on Haaland or having the players completely gas themselves? Happy with that.,"Last season this game would've ended in dropped points. Even with a really good player at false 9 we'd still be lacking a killer and we'd probably grow frustrated (as Brighton were genuinely good in defense) and end up fucking up our chances.

I know it wasn't the best game of football from us but just putting  that out there for some perspective. Hopefully we put the CL group to bed against Dortmund now.",Pep hugging him then getting right back to arguing is hilarious,What a signing Akanji is proving to be. Cancelo MOTM.,Respect to their Keeper who singlehandedly kept the game from being at least 10-0.,"Bernardo was the catalyst in the comeback. Then a masterclass by Pep in bringing on Alvarez and Gundogan. Especially Alvarez, gave so much energy in the forward line, great positioning. Should play him more. Erling Haaland, what can you say? That third goal. That’s why opponents put 3,4 players on him. What a comeback.","At least Newcastle played well and got their deserved point 

This game was a gift from us to Villa","haaland was absolutely furious in the end, because there was no intention for another goal..",Haaland rightfully will get the plaudits but Alvarez is just amazing and would be MOTM any other match we didn’t have the Nordic meat shield,Akanji and Gomez played well today.,"So so glad we've got a new contract for Rodri, honestly the best player itw in his position. There was about a 15 minute period where i just watched him specifically - his movement, how he commanded the midfield, where he looks/his awareness and how he always covered our defence wherever needed was perfect. It must be great to play alongside him",Manchester United L\*
3,So sick and tired of Haaland being ignored. We’re literally playing with 10 men every game and it’s we’re so boring to watch now on top of it!,It’s nice to win a game and not have the opposition fans calling me an oily plastic cunt about 30 seconds after the whistle.,Haaland celebrating like a madman. This really feels like 18/19 vs Liverpool all over again.,"**7** \- Phil Foden created seven chances against Bournemouth, the most by a Man City player in a Premier League away game since James Milner's eight against Aston Villa in October 2014. [per Opta](https://twitter.com/OptaJoe/status/1629563625705811975?s=20); very impressive!

And THRILLED for Haaland - all the media mania, chatter, & endless clickbaity headlines about him, his drought, how he makes MC worse, etc. was irrationally upsetting me.

**27** \- Erling Haaland's 27 Premier League goals this season is the most by a Manchester City player in a single top-flight campaign since Francis Lee's ~~33~~ 35 in 1971-72/ also Opta

EDIT - Opta was wrong per VenomousCracker - Lee had 35; thanks for correction.","A clean sheet!

Though this ""City Syndrome"" of giving up goals in quick succession has hit again, felt like may have gotten over after Real Madrid match last season but it's here to stay for more ig.

The substitution situation though i mean clearly bernardo wasn't playing up to the level, could've introduced gundo specially since we were trying to end the game in posession till the last whistle and man these are the matches where we can use some of that julian magic, come on if not for haaland atleast for mahrez after 70 odd mins.","A few notes - Grealish has been one of the best on the pitch the last 2 months. He's looking fantastic.


Kev looks tired. Might need to rest him a little bit


Ake is our best back by far. He's calm in defense and is always offering in attack.","A few of these ""worst performance under Pep"" games this season","Shoutout to the two OGs, Stones and Gundogan, they were brilliant today (despite Ilkays dodgy miss) 

Gundo won the ball around our box so many times and set us off on counter attacks",Foden Haaland Alvarez,Grealish to Mahrez the difference maker like we all predicted,Mahrez Man of the Match! Gloved Szn is BACK,Rico Lewis is ready,"This was a frustrating watch. Brentford much better in the first half 20 minutes and got a deserved goal. Thought we were going to get the winner after Foden's goal but we just didn't do enough.Brentford done enough to keep us out and that winner from Toney right at the end was heartbreaking. This world cup break has come at a good time cause we've been sub par these last few weeks. Hope none of our players get injured in Qatar and hopefully when they return in 6 weeks, they put together a great run of form. God knows we'll need it.",Guys lets move on. 4 pts behind arsenal. We can do this.,Alvarez being able to come in without pressure to be the lead scorer is going to be crucial for his development. He is so talented and having him play behind Haaland who will take all the headlines is a great combination. Excellent work from our board on getting these two.,Alvarez is an engine.. running continuously for 90mins,A 1-0 road win against a bogey Leicester team without any injuries is something I’ll take any day of the week and twice on Sundays.,"All the talk of his hatrick but Haaland also his 2 assists. Fantastic game.

United are so shit. And every time I think things cant get any better we get the shot of a sulking CR7 on the sidelines too. 

Get fucked get fucked man United, get fucked get fucked I sayyy, get fucked get fucked man United, getting fucked the guardiola wayy",Álvarez is so so good man,"Positive; Ortega looked solid 

Negatives; Boring, Mahrez","First half was exciting. Next half uninspiring. Eh. Onto the next one. At least no one got injured. 


Biggest takeaway for me is that Akanji is brilliant.",We saw both good Ederson and bad Ederson today,"![gif](giphy|lqqTQURjPNKewAE8Tp|downsized)

Off to the r/soccer thread like..","Cancelo MOTM, he is absolutely amazing. Not sure Haaland is a good fit in the prem though, can't even get 4 consecutive home hat tricks",Loved seeing Haaland head back out on the pitch to applaud the fans.,Pretty obvious but we definitely lose that game last season. Haaland is literally a gift from the gods to us.,How was Alvarez not subbed on man?,"Shame Julian didn't bag one. He is a great Bernardo sub in terms of constantly pressing. Looking forward to his rewards for it.

Stones rb? Stones dm? Stones cb? He's everywhere.

Mahrez actually played alright, got a good tackle in the box, couple nice touches and passes. Feel more like the mahrez I expect to see 

Grealish taking men on again. Hope he's 100% and not got anything from that shit challenge","When you ask for the ""perfect league game"" in terms of who gets playing time, who gets rested, how good the performance is, etc. I'm not sure it gets much better than this.

Hattrick for your star striker ✔️

Brace for your other striker ✔️

Rest for many important players ✔️

Playing time for several youngsters ✔️

Screamer ✔️

Clean sheet ✔️

Plenty of goal difference added ✔️

New signings got tested and looked excellent ✔️

Goals came early so key players get more rest ✔️

This match has made my entire fucking week 💙","Gomez looks really good. We look waayyy better when only one fullback tucks inside and we have the other going wide, as opposed to the double tuck that we've been playing.

Also Kalvin's passing is beautiful. If we can get him into that Pausa mindset that Pep likes, we could have a super deep lying playmaker to give us a different dimension.",“A bit shit but it is what it is. Shit sorry.” Lmao,"Respond to this comment with relevant post-match-related:

4,"This team is so poor in possession. They just pass it around like 2018 & 2022 Spain.

They're so afraid of giving the ball away that they completely avoid passing the ball to the middle. It's all wide passes to wingers, backpasses & crosses. 

That's why Haaland never gets the ball, cause they're all scared of the pass to the middle being intercepted and the opposition going on a counter.

All the Champions League heartbreaks have made Pep extremely conservative",Haaland is one of the funniest players in world football. Such an entertaining man,PANNICK ON THE STREETS OF LONDON,"Can I just say how excited I am that we got Perrone time??? 0 chance he’s sleeping tonight after that. So happy for him! 

Foden Haaland Alvarez all scoring, that makes me so happy. This is the WAY!","Felt for Alvarez, didn't get much service today but ran his bollocks off.",the team is so scared of trying to attack and losing possession that they eventually end up losing the possession and get countered,"A few thoughts on the game:

1. First half was fucking shocking, zero movement off the ball and Foden was invisible. Second half was much better after we reverted back to the norm more or less and showed we can do it, but the intensity isnt there most of the time lately and its quite worrying. 

2. Thats fucking offside! Rashford literally shadows the ball all the way to Bruno and feigns a shot before he takes it. You can't tell me he wasn't involved in the play.

3. ~~You see those pens given all the time for blocking the shooting leg from behind, and at no point does Casemiro touch the ball, so I don't get why it wasn't given, but we shouldn't be relying on calls like that anyway so i'm not overly bothered.~~ Saw another zoomed in angle and Casemiro does get a slight touch which causes Haaland to whiff it and fall over. Not a pen 

4. I don't want to hear anymore Grealish slander. He makes an immediate offensive impact as soon as he comes off the bench and actually takes guys on, and at times it feels like he's the only guy actively trying to get the ball the Haaland specifically. Was grinning ear to ear for him when he scored that goal. You could see how much it meant to him. 

5. GIVE HAALAND THE FUCKING BALL!! He's dropping almost all the way back to Rodri sometimes just to get some touches. Send him on 50/50's and let him fight for it. He creates chaos with his speed and strength, and we aren't getting even close to the best out of him. 

6. I don't think you get the best out of Bernardo when he's a rotation player. With the engine he has on him, I think he's the type of player that needs to be starting almost every game. He just doesn't seem like his regular tenacious workhorse self thats everywhere all the time and the ball is glued to his foot as he weaves through midfields. 

7. Why does it seem like half the time we concede a goal in a high pressure game, we let another one in just minutes later. These are the times I think we miss Dias leadership and calming presence. 

We really need to shake this rough vein of form quick or the seaons going to get away from us before we know it.","Shit on Ortega what you want, but his goalkeeping has been outstanding today.","I truly don't understand why we can't, for old time's sake, go back to Cancelo on the left and Walker on the right.",Saw Chelsea fans making polls if Haaland will outscore their whole team at the end of the season.,That fucking sucked so hard,"John Stones 🤝 title defining defensive masterclasses.

Seriously, this guy doesn’t get the goals like Kompany but he’s basically the defensive version of Aguero vs QPR for us.","Proper fullbacks and players in correct positions, we play best for ages. Hardly rocket science.","Rico Lewis putting on these types of performances at 18.

18 what an insane talent we have on our hands


Palmer also did well despite playing in a much more limited area for him. Everyone knows how good he can be on the right already so it's good that Pep is trying to expand his game even further.",All the ederson haters better thank him for keeping us in the game for so long w the shit defense today,"Pep changes another winning system for another big game.

Spurs and Arsenal knocked out",Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and saviour Kevin de Bruyne?,"We've completely embarrassed them for 80 minutes but Pep is going to be fucking fuming that we've let in those last two goals. The worldie from Antony is whatever but the other two came about from sloppiness and were very avoidable. Other than that, every single player was well and truly up for it. Haaland and Foden hat tricks, Kev conjuring magic as usual, Grealish silky, Bernardo everywhere, Ake and Akanji assured...

sigh",Rico Lewis is so fucking good,Walker how I’ve missed you my dear boy,I’m off to celebrate with a pint of Carabao,"What particularly has annoyed me this season is that whenever Grealish seems to have picked up his game he gets benched after and then it's back to his slow, self doubting play. I thought he was brilliant against Chelsea and in the run up to the Liverpool game and he didn't play at all against Liverpool or today.","Cancelo wasted stuck to the wing.

Tbh I'm a bit sad because my favourite part of the Champions League season is over.

Also I guarantee you Liverpool (runners up) will draw Porto while we will draw Psg. 100% guarantee it.","Ortega looked good today! I think he earned the start against Seville. 

I said this in the game thread and think it is worth repeating here. It's clear Pep is really really trying to get Mahrez on track with more PT.... but its been difficult to find opportunities for him due to the lack of cup games thus far. Mahrez won't improve from the bench. That being said... do not let him take PK's anymore. I think thats 3 of the last 4 he's missed. I'd rather see Palmer get Mahrez's minutes... but I still see Pep giving Mahrez the chances to right the ship.","The halftime ref they go to on CBS’s broadcast said that Mahrez deliberately handled the ball. What planet are they living on? Not the first time they’ve given a dodgy explanation defending a ref’s handball decision. When a handball was given against Laporte when we played Madrid, IFAB’s website had an example of things that were NOT a handball, under which was a scenario identical to Laporte’s. They still doubled down and explained why the red on field was right, despite the IFAB example. /rant over","As a neutral, i just came here to enjoy the happiness of this sub today",We can’t keep getting away with this lmao,"PL top scorers: #1 Haaland, #2 Kane, #3... Philip Walter Foden!

OK, he's tied with Mitro and Toney but still - Phil's on 3rd place, tied with Mitro and Toney! Cracking.

Meanwhile, KdB is, as we know, #1 on the assists table. #2 is... Bernardo Silva! Tied with Saka.

I realize the weekend isn't over yet but a nice little moment.

Oh, and Eddie is tops in clean sheets, at 5... Alisson is tied for 6th place, on 2

EDIT: weekend's over, Phil's still on 3rd for PL goals, just tied with Firmino as well now. Bernardo still on 2nd for assists tied with Saka. Alisson did not move up in clean sheets.",Palmer looked great and looks like his position could be the right wing. His fake shots and cuts are amazing. Has pace to run in behind aswell. Him on the wing and foden in midfield could be a great combination for the future.,Erling Haaland has scored more goals than Manchester United this season,We needed Alvarez the final moments.

6. this might be the most important point…we didn’t play great and we can absolutely be better. Scary how much potential is here.",Rico is such a lovely player to watch,"I liked Alvarez’s persistence the whole game, never stops chasing. Foden was so direct and creative, looked like he wanted to give it all today with how restless he was until he was subbed off",Haaland’s goolies bluer than our home kit. Must be so frustrating making the runs he does with absolutely no service. Surely even clipping the odd one over the defense will give them something else to think about if nothing else.,"I think today was fine. Not great, not even good, but totally fine. We should have won that game if it wasn’t for the utterly ridiculous refereeing.

Malasia had 5-6 fouls against Mahrez just in the first half - nothing. Casemiro got his yellow all the way in the 90th. And I don’t even want to hear Rashford didn’t play the ball so he didn’t affect the game. Two defenders were ahead of Bruno, that would have been cleared away if he wasn’t there. How is it offside when someone doesn’t play the ball but is in front of the goalie?! Hell, I’d even argue the penalty claim against Haaland is given if it wasn’t for City…

But… even if we had won, that would mean nothing… Except watching Sir red nose’s frowny face. I do enjoy that! Haaland introduced a new system and we are not getting it yet. The boy does all the right things, runs in behind, drops back, but ultimately he’s a striker and doesn’t participate in the build up. He needs deliveries, but those deliveries require space. And with one player less in midfield there is no space. On top of that KdB needs space to make those deliveries. He’s not Bernardo who would just buzz around making quick one-twos. So that makes it two people not really contributing. Add to that we play a different center back pair every game and we can’t score as well as we used to AND we introduce the chance to concede… and we see the result. 

Unlike many here, I don’t really think we need a “pacy” winger. What good is someone’s pace when he’ll just hit a wall of 8 defenders on the edge of the box 95% of the time?! What we miss in Sterling is not his pace but his ability to drop in from the wing in space, have someone overlap him or do a one-two distracting  the defense or draw a foul. At the moment, even if everyone plays well, we give opposition one dimensional tasks. And at this point most teams are good enough to be able to stop a dribbler or close down a simple pass.

On the bright side though, we are so much “below” our standards and teams around us are playing their asses off, and we are still up there, not having played Arsenal. CL is still on the table. Games are still a month away and form rarely plays a role in the knock out.

I remain optimistic. Even if we don’t win anything this season, things will click!",I haven't seen the game but everyone saying ake pocketed star boy saka is that true,"That Everton draw was at least typical City. This was an abomination.

Lavia and Bazunu looked good at least. Shout out Phil Foden for naming his dog Carabao and cursing us","Media: Questions continue to circulate about Haaland’s goal drought. Despite a strong start, the City striker has now gone for over 36 minutes without scoring.","Like Palace a few seasons ago with Townsend scoring a worldy. 

Kevin dropped another 1/10 and it cost us.

Weak defensively and wasn’t playing the ball quick enough. Haaland’s body language wasn’t great, Bernardo is much more effective centrally. I can’t remember the last time we played well in an early kick off",Dont think I ever in 3 years of watching City seen so many Back Line players slip and fall.,"This is one if those crucial hard fought wins that could decide the title, just like against Arsenal last season

Great display by Alvarez and KDB again, Phil and Haaland changed the game when they came on, absolutely love how hungry Erling was  to score

And yeah, fully deserved to win this one, parking the bus against 10 men is disgraceful",That was a fantastic watch. Alvarez just keeps getting the goals and his pass before his goal was amazing. Mahrez freekick was on point and Grealish had one of his best games. But the star tonight was Ortega. Can't believe he actually managed to keep the clean sheet. So many times I thought it was a go for sure until he made a great save. 10/10 performance.,"James Maddison: ""Pep [Guardiola] was asking me at the end why we didn't play like that for the whole game, but he knows it's not that simple!"" 💀💀💀",Gundo takes the match ball from Haaland and gives it to Phil lmao,"Seeing everyone so happy for Rico had me grinning from ear to ear. So so happy for him

Also thought all the kids that started today didn't look out of place at all which was great to see.",We should start playing Palmer or Foden at rw.  Mahrez has been dreadful,I don't understand why so many fans are complaining about this match. We lost a man before half time.  0-0 with no injuries is possibly the best result we can get.,"KDB is already in the all time midfielder debate with guys like Muller, Iniesta and Xavi. He just needs the Champions League.","First half was really poor. One of our worst performances this season. But once Alvarez, Foden and Bernardo came on, everything changed. Stones goal out of no where was really important cause it gave the team belief. And what more can you say about Haaland. He scores goals from nothing. He's incredible.",Cancelo has to be one of the best if not the best fullback in the world. He's incredible. Comfortable win once again,"More Gomez volleys, please. Loved Grealish’s play and aggression today. When he attacks the space, great things happen. Deserved a goal today",Alvarez is trustworthy.,"Foden, Rodri, Walker and Cancelo all very poor today. Foden's form is concerning. Feels like Pep has made him into a cog in the machine rather than the the more direct, exciting player he was a couple of seasons ago. Last season was difficult for him too constantly being swapped between false 9 and left wing.","Bit of a strange game. I don't think we played particularly great, and Wolves did impress me. But we got such an early goal and then Haaland with what I'd say was by far the most important goal almost by himself that gave us a buffer and the confidence when Wolves were committing forward.   
Didn't really feel like it changed much after the red either. Wolves were still impressive, ran more. And I think we took our foot off a little, some sloppy passing. 

BUT 3-0 is great and there are some really good positives. Grealish had a good game, Akanji was pretty phenomenal in his passing and defending. Cancelo had a really good *defensive* game, for those that say he can't defend. Bernardo is unsung here I think he was everywhere in the first half.

De Bruyne got two assists! I'm keeping an eye on that tally (He's on 8 in 9 now, 6 in the prem) and Stonesy was really impressive, did great work as the inverted RB and then even played 6 for 20 minutes or so really well. And Grealish and Foden scored. 

I'll take that every day of the week.",Pep using all 5 subs this year makes me so so happy. Believe me.,"People still doubt this board? This scouting system? Pep????

Not always rosy and peachy but they sure know what they're doing in the market",I don’t want to overreact based on one match but I can confidently say we’re notching 110 points and Haaland is scoring 65 goals this season.,
7,"What is Pep actually fucking thinking making zero subs, doing nothing to add to this game we should have won",Sloppy at times but you can’t hate a 2-0 result against a top 4 team.,KDB dodging all those incoming missiles with a smile on his face is another level of sweetness.,Perrone is the truth,"i was in the home end, christ i had to bite my tongue","I remember an interview when Sir Alex told his team to keep finding RVP and he'll win you the league. I look at Haaland and think the exact same thing. Why isn't Pep doing the same thing with his players? 

To add on to the inquisition, why is Rodri taking 1000 touches before finally passing it to the safest option? And the one time he should've played the safest option, he plays the pass into the an ocean of white shirts 🤦🏻‍♂️

Why is Grealish needing to play LB and putting in more tackles than our CDMs? 

Why aren't our midfielders finding the good runs that Haaland keep making? In addition, how is this team so overly dependent on KdB (and to an extent Foden) to create chances? This may be my FIFA brain talking, but I spotted about 7 good runs that Haaland made today where City - with all their quality - should be able to play that pass. 

Just so many simple things that this team could've done today and we may have been more menacing, instead we are overcomplicating.","People who say the offside rule doesn’t apply here, don’t know the rules of the game. Plain and simple. 

Goals are disallowed when an offside player blocks the view of the goalkeeper because the interfere with play without touching the ball. It’s the exact same thing here.",Incoming Arsenal fans saying they didn’t care about the FA cup anyway,"Southampton played well today, they wanted it more and worked harder. They deserved the win. Also a good wake up call to some players that shit aint so sweet lol.","It seems like we’re finally getting back to our ways. Mahrez looks in form, Grealish seems to be gaining his confidence back, kept a clean sheet today with 2 wins in a row. We need to keep this level of performance against Arsenal this Friday. CMON CITY!","Well that's a disappointing end to 2022 :/

It'll be hilarious when Haaland breaks the goalscoring record but we finish 10+ points behind Arsenal lol. 

Our fixtures at the start of 2023 are as difficult as it gets, all we're missing is Liverpool away. The only consolation is Arsenal have tough fixtures too, but they're still playing better than anyone else including us, so it's not looking great for our title hopes.",Paul Tierney refereed that game excellently. Was a breath of fresh air,Impressed by KPs passing range when he came on,"Phew. Great win, we looked phenomenal but were maybe a little too eager and Liverpool had the quality to make a couple quick comebacks.

Palmer was great, but needs to work on his decision making, maybe being on the left affected that.

Rico Lewis though...That's about the hardest fixture to play, even though Liverpool aren't at their imperious best, and not only did he belong, he was one of our better players. We have another gem in Lewis there, what a game for him. 

Ake was great, Laporte really switched on. KDB imperious. Rodri great too.

Also Stones comes on and we don't concede anymore haha. Get in Boulder.

P.S Juandy Carroll couldn't finish his dinner never mind a chance.","Serious Leeds 2020 1-2 vibes off that one 

Didn’t deserve anything today","Cancelo had an off day, they played good football, we played okay. Obviously we could have done better but that's okay there are days when you can't make it go their way.

He’s been consistently amazing for us and is almost undroppable now.","We looked really good until Kane's goal. 












Some of our players were excellent, really frustrating that Haalands runs seem to always go unnoticed by our midfield, and the slow motion trying to pass 1000 times in their final third whilst they plop 10 men in their own box just watching us pass it around is so frustrating to watch. 










Whatever contract Aké is on, double it please.",I think we’re definitely missing dias maybe if he was there we could’ve maybe pervented the first goal cause dias would tell someone to do something that being said that first goal was absolute bullshit anyone with a fucking brain can tell rashford is clearly interfering with play like it’s common sense at this point,![gif](giphy|26FxCOdhlvEQXbeH6|downsized)," That red card against Liverpool has done an absolute number on Cancelo, looks like a completely different player the last few months. Think that must be the worst game I’ve seen City play over the last few years, not one moment in the game did they look in control. Hope they pull the finger out and make a statement on Saturday","One of the most bizarre refereeing performances of the season. Not unique in how shit it was - it was more that he truly felt like he was guessing on almost every call. He got a few right but even those were not convincing whatsoever. In fairness it was really nice to see someone carded for protesting for once, but otherwise it felt like every incident was a toss-up.

Glad Haaland got his goal, quiet night for him overall.

Gundo had some beautiful turns and control, but wayward passing.

Thought Akanji looked off it though, big improvement when Stones came on.",I miss walker,"Proud of Bernado, what a baller. When the going gets tough, he stands out. Will miss him if he decides to leave at the end of this season.","Alvarez is really good. Obviously the finish was superb, but his runs, his passing, and his work rate are all top tier.

That absolutely changed the team and turned us into mentality monsters.

Seemed similar to some of those uninspired games last season that ended in a draw or loss. DeBruyne and Haaland played well and seemed motivated, but everyone else except maybe Stones and Dias didn’t seem all that bothered or were mediocre. Lots of inaccurate balls over the top and crosses from City. Scratching my head why Pep didn’t sub in Alvarez or Grealish for the final 25 minutes and chose Mahrez instead.

At least Liverpool dropped points too. PL refs gifted Chelsea three points today thanks to their incompetence and Mendy’s Oscar-worthy acting. On the plus side, Chilwell made it obvious that Boehly paid way too much for Cucurella.","For a guy who just won 3-0, pep does not look pleased. Can't say I blame him...",[Trying to determine whether I love Haaland or Alvarez more](https://i.imgur.com/YuKmGPx.jpg),"Gomez and Akanji. Solid, calm and reassured at the back. I love Akanji man, I know it's only been a game but he looks like a great purchase and Gomez didn't look like it was his first full game for City especially in the Champions league 

Our scouting department don't miss at all.

Grealish looked good for the hour he was on but I gotta mention Haaland and Foden and the way they played, they looked really good on the ball.

But my god, Haaland is unstoppable because you just never know when he's going to get that goal but it seems inevitable at some point that he'll get a good chance and 9/10 he'll put in the back of the net.

Phillips cameo was good and his ball playing ability is so crisp and clean.

Haaland also has every right to demand the ball how he sees fit because he will get that goal more likely than not.

And 4 subs before 60th minute, that changed the game COMPLETELY. 

Hopefully this isn't a one off and we'll see more of the early changes when the gameplay isn't working in the future.",Apologise to mahrez,"Great game and a good win.

Even though defence wasn't great, special mention to Rico Lewis who I thought had a really good game. Playing against top opposition and didn't look out of place.

Glad to win against Liverpool again and into the Quarters of the league cup, where we're definitely the best side left in it.

Hoping this is the start of a good run, Welcome back club football!","We looked as bad against Brentford as we were brilliant against Fulham. Last game had grit, determination, and passion. Today we looked like no one wanted to be there.",How we didn't score one past a calamitous defense plagued by injuries is beyond me. Exceedingly awful performance.,everyone calling it a dive in /r/soccer hold that wankers hahaha,"More of THAT grealish please 

Ortega #1? 

Mahrez a quietly superb game

Lovely stuff city",All it took was one game of Ortega to bring out ederson,Pretty wild that homegrown Foden from Manchester scores a derby hattrick in a romp and its the B story from the game.,On the way back from the stadium. Rico Lewis is something else. Fuck the Manchester Met,"Mahrez when drawing: I sleep

Mahrez when up 4-0: real shit",One of those ^TM,Not our best not our worst,"Alvarez being part of the A-team who Pep trusted to win the night means Pep sees what we all do in him and trusts him. 

Which…. Fuck yes. 

The football gods are pointing us to the obvious. 

Foden, Haaland, Alvarez could end up being more legendary than Sane-Aguero-Sterling",Haaland is inevitable that’s all there is to it,"Prem soon come was amazing, can't wait for him to start regular with Foden Alvarez Halaand","xG 2.36 City vs 0.11 Palace.

Cancelo did not have a good game, as I think he made two mistakes that led to Palace’s set pieces, resulting in both early goals. I guess we’ve been overestimating the need for senior fullbacks, since City played better after Pep subbed him off. KDB didn’t have a great game. Palace sat deep and KDB didn’t have much success with attempted line-breaking passes. Mahrez dazzled with his first touch, but struggled a bit after that.

Of course, Haaland and Bernardo were phenomenal. Bernardo took the game by the scruff of the neck once he moved to the right wing.","Alvarez is electric and needs to be a fixture in the lineup already. His dynamism was sorely missed today.

Cancelo has played well in moments, but hasn’t seemed to have the same consistency creating chances. I thought he could’ve come off again for Alvarez. 

Surprised we didn’t see Jack either. While Foden didn’t have a poor day, he just wasn’t making things happen. I would’ve like to see Jack come in just to give the AV defenders a different look. Phil hasn’t been running at players at the same rate as usual and Jack looked great in preseason doing just that. I guess Pep wasn’t ready to risk him, but he did bring Ake on.

All in all, AV played a heck of a game. Created a few great chances and took one. We weren’t direct or clinical enough today. On to the next one.",Never thought i would see the day of haaland scoring with his right foot after cutting inside from the inside left channel.,"19 goals in 5 games, wow.",[deleted],"This Haaland interview on NBC omg. Paraphrasing ""Yeah I should have had a hatrick. Right before I came off that Gundogan chance... I shoulda been there... little shit...."" ""pardon the language"" ""Oh shit...I mean sorry""",
11,"There is absolutely no reason we should be recycling the ball in the 85th minute. Why are we not attacking? If the answer is to avoid a last minute counter and goal isn’t that more of highlight of a problem than a solution. 

I am truly at a loss as to what this team is doing sometimes. We have the Norwegian meat shield and only once this game did we attempt to find him with a long ball and it was intercepted as soon as it left gundos boot. 

Something is wrong with this group and I’m genuinely worried at this point. Not even for CL, play like we did tonight and we won’t make it further than three more games at best. 

Where is the ruthlessness? 
Where are the subs, just one? 

That’s all. Rinse and repeat. See you this weekend for the same questions.","Was important that we got that second goal, even if it was arguably against play. We’ve missed that a lot this season.",Grealish just said he was gonna take his shirt off after his goal until he remembered he was already on a yellow 😂,"Job done. All I ask is to beat the sides we should be beating.

It was ridiculous.,I honestly think I’d take a 5-1 loss at their place at this point just to score a fucking goal there,"I hope Pep loses his shit at the refereeing that took place today. Fuck getting fined, it's absolutely ridiculous that this happened. 

Also fuck the rags 🖕",I’ve been saying it for a while now: Nathan Ake is fucking solid. So glad he got the goal and MOTM. He’s the epitome of calmness and does nothing risky or fancy. Just a solid player with great defending and decision making. Also some insane agility and jump height. Love the guy,Always did rate the fa cup.,"Haaaaaaaland hattrick. You love to see it. 

Great game from Stones, I'm so glad he's back!","Pathetic performance, very unnecessarily dropped points.",Maybe it’s not about mahrez or grealish being predictable and slow but it is about the fact that subs fucking work lol. Both looked fresh and full of ideas just as Foden did when he was subbing for them.,Chelsea fan coming to say well played and by far the better team. Please go on and win it and the League!,KDB looked just exhausted at the end what a game though.  Haaland loved seeing the passion how happy he was to win.,"Optimistic scenario: Arsenal realize they aren't in a must-win situation, relax, and drop points 

But even if they win, being 5 points behind at Christmas is far from insurmountable.","Cancelo is LB

I repeat Cancelo is best at LB making over lap runs",Come on Chelsea! Keep us on top of the table,"Stefan ortega

That’s it. That’s the comment",In games with Álvarez as our 9 I wish we had more of a setup like when Agüero was our 9. Fast wingers with low crosses or something.,"This team is unplayable. KDB, Haaland and Bernardo are just on another level. Pep is also a mastermind. Losing Jesus, Zinny, Sterling and ending up a better team without breaking the bank is a massive feat.",Alvarez's pressing and acceleration. You love to see it,I really do get the frustration around Mahrez and I cringed when I heard (I was listening at work) he was going to be taking the pen but we cannot forget he was absolutely immense for us last season.  We should call out his form but…let’s put some respect on his name.,Worst part about the match is De Bruyne playing 77 min. Honestly don’t care all too much about the draw.,"Hope Chelsea and the rags leave it at 0-0, I wish they could both lose somehow",An injury to Foden probably ends our season. Mahrez and Jack are just too slow on the ball to play together.,Is that an assist for Foden on the cancelo goal?,That was as comfortable a game as you could get in the CL. Haaland scoring again of course. Happy for Alvarez to get his first CL goal. All in all a very good night. Onto Southampton now.,"Highlights:

3 ATB looked really good. Good for City’s possession game. It allowed the compact tiki-taka mid-field, along with the gamechanging overlap on the wings.

Alvarez is incredible. Always pressing, great vision and passing. He also revived Foden who looked fantastic after he came on.

Alvarez to start!","Not worried in the slightest. I don't see arsenal going on with their streak for long, especially without partey and Liverpool already have a lot more catch-up. I've seen enough to believe that we get this done most other days","Akanji was a robbery, We robbed them twice","Our wonderful forwards aside, for me I’m so glad to see Gundo in the team every match. We are so much stronger for it.",I would start the same team vs spurs. Only difficult decision is keeping gomez or starting ake there.,2 shots on goal...Last season this match ends 0-0 or 0-1. Haaland makes us unstoppable.,
12,"Am I wrong that when your team is getting hammered by the other one in the second half, you should probably make ONE substitution at least to reinvigorate the side?","Think Pep was saying to Howe ""oh you don't like it when it's us time wasting eh?""

Can anyone permanently plaster pictures of Haaland around Manchester? So our players know who the *fuck* to actually try and find with some forward passes.",It’s a joke. That was never a goal. It changed the whole game. I can’t believe that rat managed to browbeat the assistant ref to change the decision.,I feel like Kyle Walker is getting his form back. We need his attitude and speed.,"We played like we didn't want to win the match. One of the worst performances i've seen in a loooong time. We barely created anything and we're so careless with the ball.

Really worrying me how we can't seem to get the ball to our forwards well at all. Its becoming too much of a trend.

What's up with Cancelo btw? He has been woeful since the for a while now.",Reports of the Norwegian cyborg's demise  were greatly exaggerated,I’m officially done going to the pub to watch the game with the support group this season. I’ve been 5x this year and we have drawn or lost all 5. I’m watching the rest of the season at home,Jeez that game was hard to watch. Glad we got the 3 points. And good on Grealish and Mahrez for being part of the goal.,"Thoughts on KP's performance? Id kinda checked out by then.

Mahrez arriving in form at the right time, Foden looked pretty nice and was SO close to a bicycle. Walks back at it, defense in general was good. Gomez proving me wrong. 

Cancelo however came on and got a yellow, I didn't notice him too much so add him to my list of people I want opinions on.

Ortegas passing was amazing.",I have missed watching Godri over the last month i must say. Absolutely bossed the midfield as always.,Maybe Wolves can stop Arse—checks Prem table  and sees Wolves at the bottom with only 2 wins so far—holy shit never mind.,[deleted],"Loved it when Illkay burned Willian.
Fulham we’re so bad! We even had Bernado as the last outfield player back,  multiple times","Proper argie bulldog this Alvarez lad, it’s great to always have at least one of these.","I want Pep to stay for another 6 years just to see what his fashion devolves into. Started off with 2 piece suits, now he's on hoodies and skinny ripped jeans, by the time it's 2028 I'm convinced he'll just turn up to matches in a tank top, cargo shorts and flip flops with 3 cigs in his mouth.","Massive performance. I think we all knew Haaland was going to be great for us, but I couldn't have scripted his start better myself. 

Grealish deserves a lot of love, got a lot of hockey assists today and spaced the pitch very well.

And what more can we say about Foden? Young legend!

Sucks we let 2 in towards the end, but I think we were maybe a bit mentally checked out after such a great performance.

We need to work on that and maintain composure. That's what fucked us against Madrid in the CL.",Alvarez MOTM... why the hell did Dias get it?? so dumb. give the man the dinky little trophy haha,At least ortega looked good😂,Sensible draw with Liverpool at the weekend pep's thinking ahead even tho he won't admit it were still in good shape to qualify for champions league knock out stage anyway,Well lads we were wank today but we’ve got Haaland and Kev and they’re cheat codes so we’re all good,"We looked a completely different team after the subs. Bernardo and Foden turned the intensity up. However we can't come from behind in every match. Madrid, Bayern, psg may still be better than us.",No hat trick from haaland and not even 5-0 absolute joke of a game.,Gomez looking like a real baller.,"Haalands first hat trick about 4 games into the premier league, I fucking love him",So we calling him Big Eerl yet or what?,"Felt Grealish was great today, and Akanji, what a signing.

Yes, we did look sloppy at times, but still plenty of things to be pleased about.",Alvarez scoring a brace in his first game. Where have I seen this before?,"Akanji looked like he played on this team for years. Since the first minute of the match, he knew exactly what was expected of him in our system. 

Kalvin Phillips must have one of the most beautiful diagonal passes in English football.

Gomez is everything I expected, still raw defensively. 

Alvarez helps our press so much, what a perfect signing to replace Jesus!","Rodri MOTM for me, other than a couple of misjudged passes he didn’t put a foot wrong. Was interesting to see Pep revert to double inverted FB’s, I think it’s a system that suits KDB and Gundogan more than Bernardo. Also KDB in the half space on the right is something I’ve missed seeing, I remember in 17/18 he was prolific from that area , underlapping runs/low in swinging crosses/playing in the winger.",
13,what's the use of having 5 subs if you never make 1. Is the bench for decoration?,Are we the baddies now XD,I’ve been really impressed lately with Haaland’s improved close control and decision making around the box. Would be really easy for a player like him to get a bit frustrated with lack of chances in a game and just smash the ball towards goal anytime he saw a half chance. Just thought he deserves more credit for this part of his game!,"At one point in that game, I swear we weren’t playing any formation. Pep is muy loco","Shame about Ortega 

FUCK THAT BANNER",You can say that the players are not working hard as much as they should but Pep has to take the blame as well. He’s stubbornly trying to implement a style of play that clearly DOESNT WORK.,Pep praising Julián every week and saying what a player he is and not playing him even ten minutes when he's losing,Our biggest problem is the buildup. Theres a real lack of energy and movement in our midfield. Once we get the ball to them their so slow and dont progress the ball fast enough. Leaves the wingers in unfavorable situations cause fullbacks have time to get out to them. Three at the back isnt ideal to me either feel like it slows us down,"Worst away game I’ve been to, it’s like we didn’t want it at all.",Well that was a good win. Needed to follow up with that after the win in the last game. Hopefully this puts a lot of pressure on Arsenal now. Also 25 league goals for Haaland already. Crazy that.,Should have made subs sooner,Two most maligned guys in the squad create the goal that keeps us in the title race,"Such a good, confidence filled, refreshing performance. Breath of fresh air for us",Nunez couldn't score in a brothel lol,Brentford attacked the spaces with genuine quality and earned the right to defend deep. We didn’t match their commitment and deserved to lose.,"At least the Anfield fixture isn’t in April down the stretch, for once.","Everyone's going to be hyping up Haaland (understandably) but big kudos to Alvarez, who looked absolutely ready to smash Fulham before the unfortunate red card.",I am just here to sing Ortegas praises ! would have easily lost without him. Our defense got sliced through way too many times.,"I just wanna say this. 

The last 10 seconds shithousing by KDB was hilarious.","Amazing linkup between Phil and Haaland, I thought Akanji was stellar in the back. 
Grealish had a good game running at the United back line.
Loved the scenes of United “supporters” leaving the grounds before halftime.
Have to give it to Antony, that was a good strike.
Ending was quite strange, conceding the three goal after dominating all game, but also kind of expected when we make four changes at once which clearly disrupted the flow the squad had going.
Overall, a thrill to watch. Great game",My god KDB just keeps on giving 😍 Rico and Wilson look so class.,Looks like Grealish comments has really turned Mahrez into Almiron and vice versa this season,"This thread has some insane takes. One draw, that too with 10 men, and everyone’s got their pitchforks out for Mahrez","Thoughts:

Akanji hasn’t looked particularly comfortable the past few games.

Mahrez was not good.

Why aren’t there a million bullshit articles with questionable sources linking Trossard with every top club in the world?

What the fuck was Pep wearing?",I didn't even watch the rest of the game. Just replayed that Haaland goal over and over. How on earth has he even reached that? Not to mention the absolute beauty of a cross from Cancelo. Unreal.,Mahrez slowing getting form back now. Glad pep giving him his chances to get back to normal,"* Cole Palmer looked soo good in the 2nd half!
* Grealish living up to the pre-season hype. Absolutely brilliant today!
* Sergio Gomez looks like he's with the team for two seasons instead of 2 months.","Álvarez is class, would love to have him as a starter",All to casual today. Little bit complacent as well. Walker squares that one to Haaland in the first 3 minutes and we’re 1-0 and we’ve killed them in the first 10 minutes,One note on Haaland's solo goal - he absolutely abused the defender - completely manipulating him to both make sure the shot is out of reach and to use him as a screen. Very very intelligent striker in terms of playing off the CBs.,The Haalvarez show,"That left side of Gomez-Grealish-Silva was devastating, sadly they didn’t produce an end product tonight. Grealish especially had so many key passes.",Shit I can’t say shit! Lol. Legendary post match interview on his debut.,
14,"Honestly must be easy prepping to play against City at the moment:

“They will have most of the possession passing around amongst each other, but will do it with absolutely zero intent or threat on our goal. Let them. Try to capitalize on the few chances we get, possibly on the counter, and pounce on defensive errors - there is bound to be at least one.” 

Easy.","I am really sad for Mahrez as he is my favourite player but also super happy for Foden. That corner shithousing is a highlight of the season for sure, just wish Haaland scored a goal but oh well.","By the way, Haaland has now matched Agueros best goal scoring season.

![gif](giphy|sHRU2mefl56BG|downsized)","Perrone lookiiiin sharp. Hes gonna be veeeery very interesting to follow.

And also, yes Phillips looks out of place, but cmon cut the guy some slack. Hes played a couple of minutes this season. He neeeds more gametime to prove himself. All of us that watch england and seen him in leeds over the years know he can do better. Hope he gets more time in the cup.

CMOOON CITEEEEHHHH!! 💙💙💙",Kalvin looked pretty promising today. Not with rodri qualities but great defensively.,"So I don't get it. Did we spend so long figuring out how to optimise a false 9 that we completely forgot what to do with an out and out striker on the pitch?

So, so dire.",Peps warning wasn't brutal enough it turns out.,I want Julian every fucking match. He's a game changer,"I think it's really hard for the team to change play styles between Alvarez and haaland up front. But then pep throws out a different style lineup and/or formation on top of that, just to make it more confusing. 

But.... Gomez and phillips need to get better at passing the fucking ball.","How long do we think the big refereeing errors run will last, thats 3 in the last 3 games so far with VAR missing in action.","     I can’t remember KDB ever having a game as bad astoday. Bernardo looked a bit tired as did Rodri. 

     Pep making a triple sub in the 84th minute when the team had looked like it could use fresh legs and ideas since the 60th, AGAIN. 

    Honestly my biggest complaint from the Pep era will always be his lack of subs in really close and intense games. I know he says he thinks the players on the pitch should be able to get the job done but when have the subs he makes super late on had ANY SORTT OF IMPACT?? I honestly can’t remember any off the top of my head.",Pep really said fuck r/mcfc,2.5 - 0.08 xG feels generous to Chelsea. That's the kind of game it was.,You can see how much Haaland is eyeing the Carabao Cup by the way he celebrated at the end,"City win 5-1, Haaland with 4 confident penalties. gg","We need a Walker replacement. Not a knock on Cancelo by any means but whenever you need to just shut shit down, Kyle does it. We have Kyle today and Salah isn't barrelling down the line alone...and if he does, Walker stops him.","This game gave me 17/18 vibes, where we won several games 2-1 in extra time. Incredible scenes. We bossed the field with one man down. This is how champions play!",[deleted],Phenomenal performance from KDB. Ederson’s presence is clear and obvious.,"Why do they have Neville commentating the derby. Listening to him literally talk through his nose about united non stop for 90 mins.

Haaland’s high boot, cry harder 😂 Nunez hasn’t even scored a CL goal",Cancelo absolutely unbelievable yet again,"Super excited for our January signing of kalvin Phillips.

Also walks ""out for a while"" genuinely sad news. Gomez should allow some rest for cancelo but we will need to use a CB for defensive cover.",I thought Julian played really well today aside from a few heavy touches. Showed great awareness to get a touch on the header and get it back to Foden to set up the equalizer.,We’re playing the ball as though we have a Haaland XI. Everyone else is so shit in the air,"Just wanted to give credit to our two centre backs today. Dias hasn’t been at his best for a long time, and was a bit shaky during the first half an hour or so but he really started to step up with his great interceptions and Akanji, what a signing so far. When we first signed him, I thought it was all so sudden and unnecessary but he’s amazing. 99 strength.","Shoutout to Alvarez who is also an unreal baller! Haaland though, man best player on our fucked up planet",I still cant stop laughing at how Pep kept fondling Foden bum,People told me that Haaland's link-up was shite. 🤡,
15,No creativity. No forward passing. No driving runs. No runs off the ball(besides Haaland). Too much pausa but that makes pep happy for some reason. Foden cant play in midfield according to pep cause he likes to attack and makes things happen (which is somehow a bad thing). He should be starting every week in midfield i dont care what anyone says. Pep has this team too robotic its unbelievable.,That Haaland and Grealish corner was hilarious,Not seeing enough love for Grealish. He was outstanding.,"In case you didn't hear them mention the stat, in the 5 matches Haaland and Alvarez have played up front together, they've BOTH scored in 4 of them. The one exception was Spurs away. Start them both, Pep!!",Please start Foden more Pep. Cheers,Our chance to cut the deficit to 2? Gone. Again.,"With Haaland in our team, I think we would play better football if we would simply stand back and defend like a mid-table team, and counter-attack with De Bruyne serving Haaland and Alvarez. It would be a goal fest.","Lads, someone ask Ake to empty his pockets before washing his shorts... he had Saka in there...",Ake saved us today from going 3 or 4 nil down,Thank fuck we responded to Pep's rant,Gutless performance,Lewis and Akanji coming on for Walker and Cancelo was immense.

I'm tired of so many tough matches for the freaking Carabao.","As much as I love Gundo and think he deserves minutes, we need to be seeing the Rodri + KdB + Bernardo midfield more.

Ortega is massive and I said when he first signed that he looks like a guy that will come in and fight to play more than just the cup matches. Grealish is a menace he does literally everything but score. Alvarez has shown that he doesn't need too many opportunities which will be nice when Haaland will inevitably miss a game of two. Nice to see Mahrez playing himself back to form he's been slowly improving as the season has gone on. And nice to see Phillips back hopefully he'll be in the squad when it will be announced tommorow.",Leicester love to play 10 at the back against us don’t they,I think we might stay up,"Just brilliant second half.. Rico is here to stay sha la la la

Mahrez had a great game and King Kev like always simply magnificent","Mahrez - no more penalties, please.

Ortega looked good.","No new injuries going into dippers game, decent.","Even though the score is good enough, the game statistics paint a different story. We were actually beaten on possession and passing by Brighton. We didn't play a good game and we were mostly sloppy. Happy with the win but this kind of performance will hinder us in the CL.","Ok, so I know Erling, Silva and Stones are rightfully going to get plaudits for tonight, and Grealish and Mahrez are going to get slated.

But I want to give a huge shout out to Ake. I was there, and he is just composure personified. Just reads the game, snuffs danger, really tidy defensive display. And we needed that tonight, as Akanji had a couple of erratic moments and Stones is obviously not the fastest, so having the centre halves mopping up was really important.","Pep building more depth in critical positions, smart. These are the games to try such moves (Akanji, Lewis)  and hopefully eases the pressure of a long season",I know there was a lot of concern about Gomez as a signing but he’s really taken to our style. In Pep we trust.,I think we just go 2 goals down for a laugh now honestly,"Far too pedestrian. Can’t win games against any PL side playing like that.

I would like to see Julian as a winger/ A second striker along with Haaland. Man needs to see some ball at his feet to gain confidence to perform!,"Nice to have the 3 points, but the scoreline definitely flatters how well City played. Excluding the penalty, which honestly looked very soft, xG was only 0.99 with 48% possession and passing accuracy of 82% vs 85% for Brighton. Haaland and Bernardo were standouts, Rodri was reliable as City’s outlet under pressure, but Mahrez was poor, DeBruyne’s passing and crossing was more errant than usual, Grealish was mostly invisible, and Ederson didn’t improve his reputation as a shot stopper. Pep seems to want slow, controlled buildup play, so he starts Grealish and Mahrez together, but I wish Pep let Mahrez try to improve his form by using him as a late game sub when we are comfortably ahead. I guess Pep wanted to rest Foden for Dortmund, but we are so much better when he plays. Brighton deserve credit for not just sitting deep *a la* Spurs. 

On the bright side, Liverpool lost to NFO.",Pep hugging the ref who's holding up his yellow card is all of us rubbing salt in the wound of r/soccer and European football in general,"Haaland ""only"" scores 1 and it feels disappointing. that is such a stupid thing to say/type out... but it kinda feels that way LOL.

Cancelo was soooo god damn good today.",We’re now up to 40 goals in 11 games with the CL and Prem combined. Forget the centurions we’re going for 200 goals.,Gundo should definitely start next game,Alvarez needs to play regularly. He’s hungry and we need hungry players. Haaland is hungry. KDB is hungry. But some of the others… I have questions,Akanji MOTM for me.,"We know Haaland is a sensation, but so glad we have Alvarez. He's gonna be very special for us.",Can we take a moment to appreciate the talent that is on this squad? Never in my dreams as a boy in 2006 would I think my club would have players that could really be the best in the world like Kevin and Joao.,Erling post match saying he needs to keep going because “it’s been 30 minutes since my last goal.” Wow what an monster,
17,"Has Pep mentally checked out, lol.

Must be saving the players for the eventual draw with Bristol.",Someone please clip and share the Haaland fuckery.,I said it in the previous game but having Dias back gives me so much hope. He’s a brick wall at the back and love how much he elevated others around him. Absolute leader of men.,"More than halfway into the season and idk what our best 11 even looks like. We have got 5 attackers all in form, 4 world class midfielders. Only our defense seems constant and even that changes when Stones and Laporte come back","KDB long range strike, foden goal, rodri rest

i take those",It feels like a trend that nobody can find Haaland when he makes a good run. Fuck that stadium and fuck that performance in particular from rodri,"Can't be bothered to do a full write up now. Thought we were really good after half time until that ""goal"".

All the pundents trying to play this off as ""controversial"" just are losing all credibility. It was the wrong call and turned the game upside down.  Its not even close. Its not defensible. It was just the wrong call.","Honestly I'm just glad we avoided the replay.

Arsenal will take positive on knowing they can fixate on the prem now. It's like there was always an afterthought for both sides tonight.","Thank you pep for saving me the money of another home game and a trip to Wembley when we're in a cost of living boom.....


... completely fucked my night!",Rival fans saying City are actually worse with Haaland is really some insane level of cope,I can't remember the last time we dropped points and everyone in this sub wasn't calling for a complete rehaul of the club,Johnny fucking Stones everyone,"Two perfect halves for two different reasons: absolutely scintillating in the first, cut them to ribbons, then completely calm and in control in the second. Love to see it","Rico had an amazing performance, didn't feel at all like we were missing Walker!","We pass the ball around for 30 seconds just for cancelo or stones to ping a cross to no one. De Bruyne and gundogan were just so off today. Foden hit a beauty but was pretty average for the rest. When haaland got the ball at his feet I felt like he made some pretty good plays. But literally every brentford attack was much higher quality than anything we were able to muster all day. The defending was so bad and we were an absurd Laporte and de Bruyne clearance away from losing 4-1

Also: the brentford headers were insane today. Their first goal came off 2 of them, but it also it felt like every counter they started began with a beautiful header playing them into space. This was just a terrible game :/","Did anyone else think skys coverage of the game was shocking, far too many replays and they missed a lot of action thanks to that",Appreciate Gomez for the test run for this game against Copenhagen,Want to see more of today's grealish going ahead,Another 1-0 win against Leicester from a Belgian wonder goal. Always difficult against a parked bus but I think we were really good today overall,God we've been yearning for a proper finisher and we finally have him. Akanji quietly had a great game. He is proving to be a very reliable CB. KDB was wonderful as always. Foden and Grealish played great.,How was Lewis overall? Didn't watch the match but know he got a goal.,This was a game that happened,“famous night in copenhagen” 😂 we kept a 0-0 away from home with a shit ref and a goal unfairly disallowed AND with 10 men AND without 3 out of our 4 best players. let’s go smash it at anfield,"Everyone played like they went on the piss last night and were nursing a hangover all game.

And we still won. Shows how far ahead we are from anyone in this league.",Insane that Stones banger was upstaged by an even better assist and goal. Incredible turnaround.,TOP OF THE LEAGUE!!!,Cancelos attacking from the right is really being slept on. Everything was amazing today. Great to see palmer playing great too,HAALAND,Fair play. We played like shit for 80% of that match and got a point. Martinez earned a point for Villa imo. I'll take a point considering our performance and the fact that I cannot see where the offside was for that Coutinho shot.,Akanji has settled in so well! Hoping he keeps performing this way. I reckon he starts against United as well,[deleted],"Akanji great. Gomez solid. Foden great. Cancelo great. Kev solid but some of his shots and passes were not up to his normal quality, it’s ok. Haaland was Haaland. He’s spoiling us at this point. Trying to prepare for the inevitable dip. Jack looked good, wonder if the sub was to manage his minutes a bit coming back from the knock.  Also…. Isco is still class on the ball.","Well obviously Haaland was absolutely amazing. But I was really impressed by Jack grealish. He helped out so much in defense. And ederson too. The west ham fwd was offside, still he made a really good stop.

KdB amazing assist, but he is far from his best right now. But I'm sure he's just getting started now. Long may this continue.",
18,Anyone got a replay for the handball?,Rodri motm as always for me,"Gundogan was key for both of those last two goals - the perfectly timed assist to Grealish, and the pass to KdB in space that led to the Haaland goal.","Those player ratings are way off for me. Rico Lewis was absolutely fantastic.
Gundo did have a few Misplaced and sloppy passes early on but was responsible for creating most of the action.
6.7s?! 
Crazy",Foden needs to start every damn match from now on,The World Cup really fucked everybody.,"Awful officiating today Rashford clearly interfering with play by shielding the ball. 

That Goal changed the game. But city ourselves just not good enough just don’t seem to have any passion or drive currently.  

Didn’t play quick enough or get haaland involved. He constantly on the move making runs but no one bothered to even try a ball over the top when he was running. 

These players need shaking up. CTID","Great defending today saved us, but we were struggling with possession in the final third. Not enough touches and not very fluid.
Last 10 min were probably the best display and ARS were getting frustrated and desperate. Need more of that.","How is cancelo rated 7 lol, absolutely horrendous today",Gündo’s not gone,I miss Dias and stones partnership 🤧,"Johnny Boulders, everyone.",Walk in the park for Walker today eh?,KDB is too good man. Btw I’m glad city is back and we still own this competition,We missed ake. He makes so many clutch tackles out wide,"Kev was off his game today, Bernardo has the heart of a lion, had out chances today, but they had a lot more. Could have put 3-4 past us today.",What a win. Btw who else was shitting it before that haaland pen?,Grealish has got to be the unluckiest footballer in the premiere right now. If his luck improves he'll explode.,Loved hearing the away fans for most of the game.,"No keeper is saving Antony’s shot or Martial’s pen. Ederson did well with initial strong hand save on the rebounded header. Pep will clean up the mistakes made. All in all, great City Derby win. Love seeing Haaland get his goals because he is so hungry, once he gets his first. Let’s go you Sky Blues.",First half was meh but that second half was really good to watch. Seeing Rico Lewis score on his first start was a joy to see and everyone was buzzing for him. Alvarez causally getting 2 assists and a goal and Mahrez putting in his best performance of the season. And king kev with another incredible assist once again. Good night that. Onto Fulham and hopefully Haaland will be ready,"The only takeaway from this match is taking Mahrez off penalties. Also, we won the group!",Anyway.... on to Liverpool,"We weren’t at our best, but don’t take anything away from Brighton. They are a fantastic side",foden/haaland/alvarez forever PLEASE,"We can only play the schedule we're given, so it'd be uncharitable to point out that Southampton were absolutely useless and made this a very, very easy day.

Great to see the lads enjoying their football. What a team.",Jack was incredible today.... so unlucky not to score. Palmer also sooooooo damn good.,"Alvarez changed the game, and gomez looks promising","Honestly I’m not worried one bit after the game yesterday! We’ll come good. Trust in Pep, trust in the lads. Excited to see Champions League Haaland activated on Tuesday👀",City U-18's beat Liverpool 4-3.  Today was a good day,"Casual alvarez brace, love him.","Gomez looks like a great Zinchenko replacement so far. Seems to have a good attitude, high potential and may already be a better left back. Fantastic signing considering £60m for Cucurella was the alternative.",That new lad up top is decent,
19,Just load up the 1-1 Post Match thread for the upcoming weekend while we’re at it,Pep made the change and we won the game,Absolutely dominated the second half. Away from home. Against supposedly the best team in the country. Fucking class.,"Let's pretend the last 10 minutes didn't happen. 

Great to see some direct play for once.",![gif](giphy|0rlQEKX6ISxeHhjci1|downsized),Mahrez looked most likely to score a goal and has looked like that for a while now. What are you doing pep benching him? Taking the piss,I normally hate blaming the ref for the result but what in the actual fuck?!,Tearing cockneys apart again!,"I spent all week asking Pep to prioritise the Manchester Derby game, and tbf he did.

Unfortunately for us I thought our B side would be able to defeat bottom of the Premier League, but we didn't even put up a fight. Truly terrible and lots of players will have gone down in how much Pep rates them.

It's still too early to judge Kalvin Phillips but this was a terrible first start, and I don't like hating on players but Sergio Gomez isn't good enough for a team going for silverware and champions league football. Also Cole Palmer has been worse this season than he was last season, I don't know what's up with him. Cancelo has been dreadful ever since the failure at Anfield too.

Not particularly happy with how much De Bruyne, Rodri and Haaland ended up playing either.

We usually respond well to defeats so here's hoping we get a response on Saturday in a huge game, but I'm not confident. 

Also just typical City init, knock out Chelsea and Liverpool (last season finalists) just to lose against the team bottom of the league.",Words cannot adequately describe how much i love Erling Haaland,Better now than in Europe,"Nice to win, but not that convincing. FWIW, that’s the fifth PL fixture in a row that City underperformed its xG.",Lots of positives. Glad to see Walker fit right back in his best position. Mahrez regaining his confidence. Alvarez on the scoresheet. No injuries. Clean sheet. Looking a more fluid city team with each game.,"Absolutely despise Liverpool; ecstatic about this win. Their forum went from desperately wanting to win to “who cares, it’s a tinfoil cup” haha","Drives me mental. Pep moans for 5 subs. Gets 5 subs. And makes….. 1 sub. Honestly, if foden hadn’t have scored he’d have been off at half time for Grealish. Alvarez should have started, he’s in form.","The player selection was fine, just needed to play Akanji on the right, Dias and Ake centre, Cancelo on the left and actually have a go at them. Showed Milner too much respect. Should've been tearing up that left side all night.

Nunez is so shit lmao",Kdb is the goat god damn I love that man,Grealish was immense,"An absolute stunner to beat a parked bus side? Nothing feels better.  Hopefully this result, albeit a poor match, will give the players some much needed energy or confidence.","Hope Rodri, Walker and Stones will be fit by mid October, schedule looks tough.",Alvarez and Rico were great. KDB doing KDB shit. Just want to see Wilson Esbrand smile once,"Remember how good we thought we were in the lead up to Copenhagen away?

Pepperidge farms remembers",What a poopy game,Most of the time Brighton played like man city and we played like a team trying to stop man city.,"Everytime Mahrez & Grealish have started so far we've looked clueless on the pitch with little to none chance in penetrating deep lying defences.
As opposed to when Bernardo/Foden/Alvarez went on the field the tempo got so much faster and it was electric.
I'd like to see only one of them on the pitch for now until we figure out how to play both with Haaland","1 goal only, Haaland might be washed",Mahrez with a 9 rating !! Didnt expect that,"My faith was shaken at halftime but Haaland restored it and then some. 

thank u viking robot boi",Foden getting mugged off by 80 year old young is worrying. As is walkers form.,"interesting that both the first and last goals are basically the same - KdB crossing from an overlapping run - but with different players playing different roles. In the first one Foden plays him in, Haaland is first to the ball, and Grealish taps in at the back post. In the second Haaland plays him in, Foden is first to the ball (and flicks in), Grealish is again at the back post I believe.  

System goals. Love it.","A simple (and a very smart and accurate lol) calculation shows that Haaland will finish the league with 94 goals lol. Jokes aside, Prem is wrekked.","Loving what I’ve seen today from the team but god above Sevilla are so bad

Solid debut from Akanji and liking the bits I saw from Phillips when he came on. Gomez was pretty decent too.",“A bit shit” 😂,
20,Pep is literally always trying to prove a point and right now this season it’s exhausting. Not even results wise but this Allegri football is sour af,Haalands shithousery is so jokes 😂,"Ruben Dias is such a stud, I'm estatic that he's back in the starting eleven.",Gotta lay 4 3 3 with phoden haaland and alavarez sometime soon,How was Ruben Dias?,"We dont want to win anymore,

What happened to scoring a goal in the first fucking half?","Imagine the outburst if city had scored such a goal! Still, utd scoring such a goal should have had lesser impact. We didn’t play well, we weren’t incisive and sharp in the final third. We all joke about Haaland needing only one touch to score a goal, but he still needs that “touch”. He needs to get the ball. He can’t get a reliable service if we act like a one-trick pony crossing the ball that doesn’t reach him.","Good win...Oregano,Grealish and Ake excellent.
Main worry now is how many games Rodri is having to play.
He could have done with a game off..don't think Pep fancies Phillips at all.",We haven’t been getting many high xG chances for a while now (besides 4-0 Chelsea). I hope pep can work his magic and change that,"What a match by Grealish. Worked his arse off, probably got 10+ interceptions.","I'm not gonna cry about the league being over like some people but we seriously need to sort out our form

We need a 10 win streak and to beat arsenal both times we play them",Pep's gonna diss us now for suggesting that lineup because his version worked better 😭😭,"In a game with a lot of shining stars Palmer was sadly not one of them.

That being said the narrative would be different if he placed that ball properly or assisted Juli. Not a complaint more of a venting of frustration. Still hoping for big things, even if it's as a squad player","City looked excellent going forward, but defensively we were way too vulnerable. Klopp’s strategy of having his forwards sprint past our high line to chase long balls would have cost us again if Nunez didn’t have such a stinker.","Looked like a bunch of guys who didn't wanna get injured and had their heads somewhere else vs a bunch of guys who know they're gonna be on the beach for a month and could run around as much as they like to me.

Very poor showing but not entirely unexpected tbh.","Terrible game by Cancelo and Pep (Another 5d chess attempt that completely backfired). Off day for KdB. Oh well, we go again.","Grateful for the 3 points.  I’d also like to offer referee Darren England a large bag of dicks, softened from sitting outside in the gentle, cool Mancunian rain sent courtesy of Mr. Bernardo Silva.","Perfect night for City in the biggest competition in English football.

Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham all out. 

(Liverpool going into pens as I write this)","Reminds me of 19/20 games, Kevin carry job to bailed us out every weeks","This was a beautiful match, United have been utterly dominated, 6-3 is a flattering result. Two lifelong City fans pulling hattricks on the Rags made me cry.",Oh ye of little faith moaning and whining at half time - tut tut tut 😁,We sold Sterling now Mahrez is the one missing all the chances,On to the next one ‘twas a weird match,Haven't seen any replays but I thought Akanji was fouled (a little push) in the buildup to Trossard's goal?,"Not sure if the cameras picked it up but I was sat in 116 behind the goal and Haaland started drinking the goalies water at a corner in the first half lol was funny as fuck

Atmosphere was unreal after they scored, I was stood on my seat roaring at the bastards","Felt like there should have been more there, De Bruyne easily should have had 3 assists if not more. Still, can’t complain, keep going on through teams like it’s nothing and it’ll be a very straightforward season. Cancelo obviously the star, but what a difference Rodri makes in midfield, felt like we always had the ball. Disappointing from Grealish when he came on, think he needs starts to really cement his impact.",Looks like Pep wants to finish the match in the first half then practice in the second half.,so that is what we were missing against Palace last season.... the big Nordic Meat Shield,Did Phil Foden really get locked up by a 40 year Ashley Young? What was that shit.,Haaland is the first Prem player to score in each of his first 4 away matches.,"Alvarez is amazing, I'm so happy that he scored 2.

Most likely 8 point gap again,"ref was dogshit, but our performance wasn't great either.. i think its time to ditch this predictable 433 formation and play for 2 strikers, every club knows how to counter haaland by now",Ortega should get more starts.,"Hey, it’s one less competition for us to worry about injuries and fatigue. If I had to say we lose one, it’s absolutely the carabao cup",Title race heating up,"Worst performance of the season IMO, that was as bad as any loss",Wouldn't be surprised if we don't see the four players that got subbed early on start for a while now. Pep has seemingly been unhappy with their performance all season and he never makes early subs.,Basically a perfect game.,Hahahaha fuck Liverpool and their toxic fanbase,Only thing I've noticed is that we're not great in the final third,Did not care or the tactical setup today. KDB needed to be central. Ever attack we had came off his foot. Disappointed but they needed to play a perfect game to beat us when we couldn’t even get out of first gear today. Lads looked tired too from the red card earlier in the week.,"Alvarez is a kun regen. 

Bernardo was our best defender.

Kevin never stopped giving 110%.

Erling is inevitable. 

Var can suck a fat one. 

Pretty much sums up the game.",Wow we gave up so many opportunities. What a game from Ortega Moreno,Somebody need to check Dias. Man's head is made from steel to withstand Stones's kick,Today was better than Christmas morning,Alvarez really came alive and showcased just how complete his skillset is. MOTM easily.,Great that we topped the group but my god that was such a boring game. We had no chances apart from the penalty. We move on to Leicester.,On to the next one…,"Not the best performance. Imo Mahrez should never start. Ederson 100% should've made that save.

Haaland a beast, Bernardo a goat, blackeye De Bruyne with a banger.

Onto the next one I guess.",Thank Pep for quick sub and Haaland is GOD.,Hate having to beat out B team like that but they gotta learn.,Is this the return of mahrez? Excited to see more of gomez.

Man is a game changer no idea what pep is saving him for .. if he doesn’t start against Tottenham then …,I missed the game. Can someone fill me in on how a l 3-0 win is something I’m seeing people complain about?,"City looked extremely dangerous, for me the quiet standout tonight was Gundogan. He glided on the pitch like David Silva, completely untouchable while dictatating the flow of the game. He is undroppable at the moment, his midfield game rn looks the best it ever was.",Pretty well happy with every performance tonight; Foden was a baller; Haaland did his thing but I think Akanji looked really solid as well - great debut from him,"Lads can we show Ake some love.

Clean sheet
HUGE 3 points💙",Remember the time Pep overthought it and we won 3-1 away to Arsenal?,Rico Lewis Remember the Name.,"Phil Foden STAR BOY. what a game today. If we get this Phil the rest of the season... watch the fuck out. 

Ake was outstanding! Even saw him overlapping a few times... he's making improvements going forward and its wonderful to see. 

I don't understand all the Phillips hate. He was fine... yes its a drop off from Rodri... but its RODRI. The best DM in the world, there will always be a drop off. Phillips came in and played 90, giving Rodri a rare day off. THAT is what we needed. Clean sheet for the team with him in there, more than enough for me. Glad to see him get the run, and I think he will get better with more PT. 

We kept shit talking KDB in the game thread, then he goes and scores to shut everyone up. I'm fine with the early misses.... he was just getting those out of his system so he will be ready to go against Newcastle on Saturday. 

Great to get the win and keep hope alive for this Trophy! after 5 games away, back to the Etihad on Saturday!","no pace on the wings, Alvarez the only player taking shots from distance, haalands runs being completely ignored, no overlapping fullbacks, wtf is going on?","Imagine losing 3-0 to Brighton despite having, according to the media, pretty much the best player in ever position in the league, and not being on the receiving end of the most depressing result today. Hope the refs are happy, old trafford VAR decisions are such a farce",how did this team lose to united?,Not like anyone played all that well but I give Cancelo a 1/10 today. Rico in for the Derby,Tbh gotta give the motm to mahrez,how was there only another minute on top of the +11 when the game didn't even get started again until 2 minutes had been burnt hahahahahaaha,"When he is good he is ridiculous, wish he would be more consistent, both in form and in fitness...

Couldn’t get the ball in the box to save our lives you’ve gotta make more happen when you’ve got Haaland up there. No need for those hail mary crosses. Back line didn’t play their best but it wasn’t unforgivably awful. Still a lot of season to look forward to,First game live what an experience! The atmosphere was insane!!!,Not bad. Might be out of form but it's still Chelsea so a 2-0 win is nothing to scoff at no matter how it happens. Ortega easily motm and happy for Rico and Palmer to get solid minutes. Onto the next one.,"I understand why Leicester defends with 160 people in their own half. The moment they open up and try and play like they have a spine, they concede 5-6 from us.","what a game! double hattricks are amazing.. but I want to give a shout to Akanji, Graelish and Ake. Akanji is undroppable right now. holy fuck what about him didn't Dortmund want?? Ake played very well and Grealish was amazing in the first half. Set the tone RIGHT away goading Dalot into a yellow. 

sucks to concede those late goals, but its worth it to sub off Gundo and KDB... def need to keep them fresh. They are more important than GD...  It's also clear that Gomez needs some more PT because with the way Walker is going with the injuries... he might be called upon more than we expected. He has barely played and it showed today. Get him and Rico some PT so they can be counted on if needed. 

Also... I think Martinez needs some new pants... he has no more pockets.","Rico Lewis is gonna make it man. That makes me so, so happy. More than you believe.","I think we learned that our 4-4-2 isn't good when playing a team that can defend well. We need that extra midfielder to create chances.

Was a better second half, and I'm not trying to slag him off but I don't particularly want to see Mahrez take a penalty ever again. I feel like at this point he's got too much self doubt whenever he steps up for them. 

End of the day we've won the group with a game to spare.

I will say I'm a bit concerned we've gone 3 away matches with scoring, but 2 of those were in very tough grounds and the other was because of a red card.

Onto a tricky lunchtime Saturday game.","Not too bothered, rested most players/subbed early. Pep always wants to win every game, can’t see us dropping points to Sevilla and Dortmund. Bring on Sunday.",grealish - haaland - foden is our best front 3,I'm happy Pep is grilling that shit ref. He fucked us over against Real Madrid as well.,"Erling halaand, he's top of the league 🎶🎶","it’s nice that haaland has taken all the headlines, otherwise it would be “quadruple???” talks already","• Erling Haaland is the truth

• Alvarez looked class. We need to get him in the team.

• Despite the OG, I really liked what I saw from Stones

• I have a good feeling about this Sergio Gomez kid.

• Thank God Bernardo stayed. He’s the second best midfielder in the league.",Shit luck. Could have easily been up 3 or 4.,"Wolves picked off far too many of our passes for my liking. Had they been at full strength we'd have had some real problems. 

But very happy to get 3 points on the road, happy Jack is getting stuck in, happy Akanji is a rock, happy to see Julian adding energy, happy to see KdB making those overlapping runs, happy to see Eddy with a clean sheet -- plenty to be positive about. 

Come on Brentford! Arsenal drop points and we go top.

Also just had a look at our GD - now +17. Awesome.",So we learned today that Alvarez and Haaland are both amazing,Akanji and Gomez played as if they have been at city for years. Unbelievable how calm and composed they were even when pressed by the opponents. Mad salute to the scouting department for getting these guys in so quickly and at such great prices👍,"Man, we are so lucky to watch a team of this quality. So many high skill players and we bring guys like Bernardo and Alvarez off the bench...  


Truly feel like with Haaland we are unstoppable now.",
23,"Is Pep playing games with no Subs? Or is it his ego or wtf is going on, why cant we change the tactics abit its not working passing to the side all the fucking time, like we have a striker but blindfolds are on???? 

I dont get this, city are becoming almost frustrating to watch in every game, and we have such great players but everything is just pass pass pass pass back pass pass pass oops op scores a goal pass pass pass again???

LIKE PEP HELLO",Fucking off,"KDB ran a fucking marathon. Oh my God. His passes were way off, but he made up for it with the pressing and thats what makes him a world class fucking player. Best of the best. 

First half tactics and lineup was way fucking off for the style of football we needed to play. Once that changed, once we got a better backline to absorb their attacks, and pressed better upfront and got some chances, it was over. If we started that way we would destroy them completely.","Interesting bit in the post match where Pep talks about how Rico will be an 8 in the future:

The directness from our wingers has been lacking so much this season so it’s great to see Mahrez and Grealish getting at their opponents and constantly trying to make things happen. Really keen to get Dias back into the side and hopefully Bernardo, Foden and Cancelo can start to reintegrate and get back to their best. Feel dirty rooting for United this afternoon but any dropped points from Arsenal and we’re right back in the mix. Also obligatory Haaland is a fucking menace and we are blessed to have him.","People saying the title has gone need to get a grip. We’ve got 22 games left. Two of which are against Arsenal. If we turn up in those, we’re right back in it. Pre-Mansour or Post-Mansour, it’s never easy. We’ll get a string of wins together and keep maximum pressure on Arsenal. We’ve been in this situation and worse many times.","I didn’t get to see most of the match due to an appointment with my doctor but I have to say, the goal was scored in my first 10 seconds of tuning in. Cmon city!!!!!!","City tearing cockneys apart, again 🎶🎵",Fuck Liverpool. Fuck their fans in particular.,Love that we have to live with this shit performance until the end of December. Cheers.,"That match went pretty much EXACTLY how I thought it would go all week

Not one part of me thought we would beat Liverpool even with their weakened side",cocaine doesn’t hit like this,"Ortega on a free.... god damn another Txiki master class. He was so good. Defense in front of him was pretty leaky... but this was the B team, 2 kid FBs... and a lot of the Chelsea A team. I'll take the clean sheet and the win. 

What a game from Jack... so unlucky not to score. If he plays like that night in and out, no one will talk about his G/A. That was great to watch. I'm excited to see Phillips back! I have a feeling he's gonna be huge in the 2nd half of the season. 

Bonus that Haaland, KDB, Foden, Ederson and Cancelo (heh) got a full night of rest. Hoping the lads kick some Brentford butt on Saturday and go off on a high note into the World Cup (where we pray for no injuries, and I'm bad so I'm rooting for everyone on City to get KO'd early)",Ederson was great today,I've had an erection since the first half 🙂,"Need to see more of Lewis to be honest but it was great to see Alvarez get his goal and assists because what more could you ask for to get going.

Onto Fulham but I'm a bit worried about the last 16 because PSG finished 2nd behind Benfica so that means we could possibly draw them right?

I fucking hope not.",I'd like to see more of Palmer in lieu of Mahrez's current form. Palmer has those moments of control in the box that make for really exciting chances. More of those will be good for the club.,"Dodgy VAR on Mahrez, should’ve won the game",Not the greatest performance but comfortable once the 3rd went in. Haaland is massive but his fitness is going to need to be managed. We're going to need to see a lot more rotation in the coming weeks - the stretch of fixtures from now until the World Cup is ridiculous.,It's obvious that Haaland is an excellent teammate going by all the love from former teammates,"Great start to October, some needed rest, lets batter Liverpool next Sunday.","Thought grealish looked great today, and my word is Sergio gomez good coming forward. Excited to see what he has to offer",NO MORE MENTAL MIDGETS. We are fucking scary. Teams are scared to score twice against us now.,"Pep’s insistence on not bringing on subs when it matters the most clearly will never go away. Such a poor goal to concede but lucky that was it for Villa, last 10 mins of the match it was all them.",Jack’s best game for City. Akanji is looking like a steal. I think he’s played every minute since he joined the squad. It’s easy to see why.,"Apart from all the obvious glory, I thought Palmer played really well. He looks like a part of the team. I hope he does well and becomes a mainstay in the first team.",I rate everyone on the team,"I remember these games with jesus and sterling. Very few chances, and ofc all wasted.

Go back to what works. Enough of the atrocious and idiotic fucking lineups and tactics. If we're wanna change our style up, do it in the summer when we get new players to do that. Enough of this bullshit. I've had enough of watching this trash every week.",Isn't there a rule that if an offside player was involved in the game without touching the ball like blocking goalkeeper vision or access to the ball should be counted as offside?,We need walker to play against arsenal away coz martinelli is rapid,"surely that was our worst performance this season,right? warra abysmal performance man.","Didn't catch the game, any reason Lewis was brought off at half time?","Another one of those games! I see Pep is trying to get that extra man in midfield to break their rows of buses and it worked by in large. Dominated the game, created chances, the ball just would not go in, not through lack of trying! Stats say it all Everton 2 shots all game 1 on target… no luck!",Rico Lewis changed the game completely what a special special player,Mahrez is on fire love it another big win for City,Kevin De Bruyne wanted to make sure everyone knew he wasn't the problem at the world cup. 😆 he should have had 1 or 2 more assist also.,"Glad to see some people calling out Pep and his ridiculous formation today, lack of subs, and player selection. He is just as much to blame with his stubbornness and unwillingness to change as the crooked ref, bullshit VAR, and players all looking to Qatar.",Haaland's first game for city without a goal contribution by the way.,Head over to r/soccer for a load of salt,"was not expecting such a performance, fantastic game by Grealish and Alvarez, Moreno with some unreal saves, total control of a decent Chelsea side.

Totally exposed on the counter several times, Rico not the best is natural, but Gomez really is quite poor defensively. Needs a full season at least before I can see him being anywhere near starting quality.","Happy we won. Good control of the game until the final 15 minutes. 

Rodri, Laporte(one error aside), Ederson all great this game. De Bruyne with individual brilliance, simply a genius.

Everyone else decent.","Cracking game from our front line. Haaland and Foden will take the headlines but Grealish was sparkling; he made things happen with his dribbling and foul baiting.

The scoreline actually flattered the rags; they were nowhere near us all game and only scored when we switched off to conserve energy. That said its a shame we conceded 3 to them, but I'll accept that as long as Phil and Erling get their goals.",anyone else had tears of joy for rico lewis? is this how a proud father feels?,Ortega was really good tonight + we’re top of the group. Not much to say about #26. We move on to the next one.,"well, there's no way sevilla is winning at the etihad so knockout stages are pretty much guaranteed. nonetheless, i want my 90 minutes back. i hope our awesome fucking away kit isn't cursed",Cancelo is a LB. Bernando is MOTM.,"Dortmund switching from 4-5-1 to 5-4-1 was their undoing. The man missing from midfield is what allowed cancelo time for that cross, and Stones space for the shot. Great adjustments from city, but they caught a break from Dortmund trying to fix what wasnt broken.","Southampton have caused us problems last season but that City without Haaland. We are a totally different team now. Even when he doesn't score he occupies the defenders because of how dangerous he is. Foden has been great recently and Cancelo was easily MOTM. He was so so good today. And yeah even if it took a while, Haaland did eventually get his goal.",The kids are ALRIGHT HUH!?!!?!!! So good from Palmer. Brings danger and composure. He’s incredibly tricky with his lanky build. Gomez is a great attacking wing back AND can play on the ball in the middle. Esbrand just looks at home there add something different. Both need some positional work of course. Lewis just seems like he is perfect lol. I don’t even know what to say about him. 17 playing like a 28 yr old. Need technical maturity maybe and some physical maturation. But so so promising.,Haaland you beautiful bastard!!!!! Absolutely loved this game,"Looking at the scores from last season, we were at 13 points after 6 matches so we are a bit better this year, lol.",I can't understand people saying we were poor. We were fine to good before the red. We just let off the gas. We played Wednesday folks.,Agueroesque finishes by Alvarez !,"Really rate Gomez. Think he’s got a good left foot and whipped in a few dangerous crosses. Looked solid on the ball. Also palmer looked good, stuck to his task, tracked back, put in tackles. I’d like to see him flow a bit more and be given that freedom to go forward","MOTM for me is rodri. Yes Haaland won us the game but Rodri was simply flawless today. 

Kdb and Foden both seemed off today, although KDB picked up in the second half. Grealish getting better and better each game. Gundo was superb too as always. 

Feel like we miss the pace on the wings.",
25,"We need a serious investigation into whose wives Haaland has shagged. 

It's the only explanation that no one passes to him.","I’d already turn gay for haaland before this game but after that whole corner showing at the end, I think I’m in love","He's him.

Phillips is good defensively but not a match for Rodri on distribution. Also he needs to take it easy with those fouls, or he’ll be on the bench anyway. 

Amazing Aggro from the team for the first 60 min. But it was good to try out the others.",Thoroughly enjoyed that game,Peps asking to much from Lewis,"This city looks worse than 2016-17 city. Absolute joke of a performance in a derby against your arch rivals. 30 minutes of good football but in typical city manner this season, 60 minutes of total underperformance.

Arsenal deserve to win the PL. Advancing to the quarter finals isn't even guaranteed tbh","Not a pretty performance, they still haven’t found the cohesion to pass through teams quickly but the individual quality came through once again. 

On the other hand I cannot believe how poor the officiating has been recently. Obviously it’s always been a problem but the errors seem to be getting more and more glaring",One can only hope that this was the nadir of this season and that we can only go up.,A clean sheet - it's been too long! Defences win titles - we need more of that!,I hope this is a wake up call. We’re not retaining the league playing like this. Need more goals,Chad Pep showing how shit the supporters version of a line up is before dropping in that second half tactical masterclass.,"Walker and Laporte coming back at a crucial point in the season, definitely needed in the next few fixtures",Always love a win against these lot. Club football is back baby. 💙💙💙,"I can’t believe how many times gundo and Silva and even haaland were the only ones stopping breakaways.  Not a defender in sight??  

Like they literally got back to the goal 3 or 4 seconds after the play was over with just our attackers protecting the line. 

That’s some weak heart","On a lighter note, I was talking to an Arsenal fan at the pub today who said that Darwin Nuñez reminds him of Fernando Torres 😂😂",cant even imagine the scenes if haaland wasnt on the pitch to take the penalty lmao,"Great job! Great to have Kalvin back. Cole and Rico looked great. Ortega showing his bundesliga skills. I think Gomez is good and feels dangerous in offensive positions, buuuut defensively i think he shows he isnt quiteeeee there yet. Great win tho.

CMOOOON CITY!!!!!! 💙💙💙",Not the prettiest but I'll happily take the three points and root for Forest tomorrow. I can't help but thinking if Haaland were there that pass to Gundo from KDB would have been smashed into the net. Hopefully he's back and makes a feast out of Fulham and Brentford before the break.,Sensational game. Still miffed about 3 goals conceded,Does anyone here know the song they always play after the games? It was on tonight as well. I’ve never found the name of the song!,Was Cancelo taken out because that kid kept beating him?,Gomez’s red card kinda reminded me of Foden’s red against Atalanta back in 2019,"A win is a win. One day at at time, maximum points at a time. Next up dortmund for at least a point to top our group.",We have Haaland,Hopefully we exorcised out Southampton demons today. Good win!,"So are we hoping all our players countries will get eliminated early for rest? I think world cup is minor
Leagues in comparison to all the cl games I saw today","What a performance from Stones, made a mistake and immediately stepped up right after. He’s got that monster mentality",I really miss Sane on the wing. I feel like the pace on the wing is what we’re missing recently.,"Fantastic result in a game I was nervous about. Also great for Grealish to get a goal. 

Manuel Akanji though. What a steal he was.","Of course Haaland gets all the flashes but Alvarez's quality is crazy, you will see how he gets better and better, this kid has no ceiling. A great product from the River Plate youth academy. C’mon City!",Haaland really should’ve done better. 2 goals just isn’t enough,Post match haaland is gold 😂,
26,Lmao they zoomed in on the wrong bald city guy at FT,Lovely to see Bernardo's instant impact. Influenced the whole team too. Outstanding.,That Haaland performance by the way stupendous proper centre forward performance,"I like clean sheets, but I like winning more.

Because soon would be great.",Today I am.... disappointed,Who that cunt was on the panel for sky sports is / was needs to fuck off,"How can we play so badly but our lowest score out of 10 was 6.2? Surely the ratings are hugely exaggerated? A poor performance is lower than average, aka less than 5.","3 points, great job team!","Mahrez was pretty good this match not gonna lie. Foden probably would've done better than grealish tho. Should've subbed him in sooner. Would like to see grealish capitalize on his chances like he could have last game. This game he didn't have many chances though. Foden I think would have made something happen eventually. 

Off night for de bruyne. But whatevs. Get the bad game out this time. He'll show up when we really need him 

Happy new years everyone",It’s second half of the season gloved up clutch goal starts every game mahrez szn boys,Thought Walker was excellent today. With and without the ball. Such an important player for us. Will be crucial v United. Mahrez MOTM for me.,We finally beat liverpool what a way to end the year,Our players looked past this game and on to the World Cup…. Do I blame them? No. But it’s another reason why a mid season World Cup is absurd. Fuck you Qatar.,"Dunno why we moan about subs.

Its been the same for years. Teams not doing well he rarely ever subs.",KDB AND BERNARDO were incredible,"Some initial takeaways from a great team win:

\- Ortega was spectacular, easily MOTM

\- Grealish played his best game in a City shirt, love that dude

\- Rico still has plenty of experience to gain and Gomez seems lacklustre in defense. would definitely look into proper FB cover in January

\- Alvarez has it all in his locker, what a player

\- I haven't been much a fan of playing both Grealish and Mahrez together, as I think they both need a more direct winger opposite them, but they worked well together today which was great to see

\- Great result. Rested key players and came away with the W",One of those games you just have to grind out if you want to be Champions. Good win in the end.,This was an iconic game. One that City fans will remember for a long long time. Even with United getting 3 goals late on. Two boyhood City fans destroying the rags by getting a hattrick each. This City is ours and you'll just have to accept that. Manchester is blue. 💙,Gomez was in no man’s land for the first goal. Dias let him hear it.,Guaranteed top of the group. I'll take it.,"So sloppy lost possession more times then they have in the entire season so far. VAR didn't help but besides that we just played very poorly, literally couldn't get inside the box for a chance. Lacking attacking mindset as well. That's all I got from this game. No positives unfortunately.",God the ref was awful,Feel bad for Grealish. Being overshadowed by a £17 million 22 year old from Argentina.,The moment Bernardo is out. The team lost possession a lot,Gomez looks like a promising signing,"Bernardo was unplayable.

Gündoğan with incredible impact.

Haaland with unreal movement.

Foden showing his quality.

3 POINTS. GOOD DAY.","We won't win them all, but that Mahrez sub might be the worst thing Pep will do all season. Totally ruined the flow and he did absolutely fuck all in 30 minutes. Bit disappointed not to see Alvarez.","3 games in, only conceded a goal so far. Got adjusted to the team in no time, giving us a sense that he's been playing for us since an eternity. What I love most about Manuel Akanji apart from his mentality is his desire & ability to beat the press and make forward passes, instead of making the trackable easy backward kick at the goalie or nearby defender horizontally. What a package.","Might as well just hand the Ballon d'Or for this season.

Pep ""you will only be playing 60 minutes so make the most of it"" Guardiola suits Haaland pretty good thus far haha","Very nice.

Haaland with another brace like he's a dentist. A clean sheet too.

Good debut for Akanji and start for Gomez, but have to say Sevilla are one of the most passive teams I've seen in a while.

Onto a very difficult game on Saturday.",HAALAND HAALAND,
27,Yeah I have very little confidence in our ability to win this competition. There's just something not going right with this team this season.,Inagine teams shut up shop against teams like they do against City 😂,The Match Dramatically changed when Pep took off Mahrez and put Silva in an offensive role! Instant sauce!,When will John stones return,"Someone needs to buy Ally Mccoist some glasses, couldn't spot an offside to save his life.","Apart from Mahrez hitting the cross bar, we had no chances at all. We can’t create fuck all anymore.","Don’t care about losing when we play this poorly, but to have a blatantly offside goal to be given against us . . . a bit of a punch to the gut that","Laporte needs to be starting from now on. 

Also... Pep is going to target Zinny at the Emirates. harsh, but City has to exploit that.","Need Delph to roll into the dressing rooms shouting: ""baaaasics""","What a way to win and Haaland man. What a phenomenon, and I love that Mahrez wasn't selfish to give Haaland his third man, but most importantly....

It's 25, It's 25, Erling Haaland, he's scored 25!!

And he's scored 4 damn hattricks in 19 games, far surpassing Ruuds own record in 68 games.

I'm so glad that Peps' words have been heard and that performance was a response but hopefully, it's the start of something we truly need in order to catch Arsenal.","can’t believe we spent 100m on Grealish for
him to have a picnic on the wing every game. Just run at a player for once",Think it could have been 2-0 with alvarez pressing after the 60th minute,"I hope we can maintain this form now till the end of the season!!

Some real congested fixtures to follow...",Is Nunez a social experiment to see how Liverpool fans gonna justify his pricetag ? He went MIA in the World Cup and missed 3 clear cut chances today,"I was getting Leeds at home 2020/21 vibes for a lot the second half. 

Gutted we lost - we need to start a lot better in future games. Where we’re not winning in the second half we’re always on the back foot and prone to counters.","We were actually really solid at the back, but made some alarmingly baffling errors like the back line setting up IN FRONT of the halfway line. It literally happened twice; we should have been punished for both.","Yeah KDB was absolutely on it today and he played his heart out because that's just what you want on a day like this.

Alvarez worked hard too just before he came off and so did Bernado Silva.

What a way to win a game like that","Nice to win without injuries, but something not quite right, Chelsea had so many big changes, could easily have scored 2-3 goals.","Cancelo and Rodri have got to be exhausted, they have to play damn near every game",Proper captain behavior. Gundo gets a second ball for Haaland so both the hat trick boys get a ball,"if we were to win UCL there is no other way around than to play all the best teams. Honestly no fear of any draw, be it PSG or Pool, just play it and ppl will know we are the champs",Was at work when this game happened. Doesn’t surprised me it was bore. Surely can we get someone else to take pens instead of Mahrez?,[deleted],"Mahrez is in such bad form. No creativity, bad link up play, bad shooting, and bad workrate. Really hope he can find his footing again","Alvarez the super sub? He’s like Camavinga for Madrid last year, literally makes an impact every time he’s on the pitch","Man, I can’t wait to see Julian start and get some game time with the first team and not just with the kids as well as without Haaland on the pitch. I hope it’s just a collective effort to help him break records but everyone always look for him in the penalty area which sometimes appear very obvious to predict.","Riyad, what a performance. I'd forgotten how good he was at corners, and great all around!! Was actually really impressed by the Copenhagen goalie, it could have very well been more goals if not for his heroics.","Finally watched the game and wow. We have such a great mentality it's ridiculous 

Quick thoughts 

-Alvarezs press is ridiculous 

-foden in the midfield is gravvy 

-gundo so solid 

-walker...stick to being a fullback 

-stones and dias soooo solid. Unreal 

-cancelo left back liability 

-haaland. Poetry in motion

-rw Bernardo is IT. 

-abandon the inverted fullbacks asap. 

-great mentality 

-kdb off today, no worries tho

Great game come on city",I am sorry but Walker should be below 5. he was terrible today.,"Ake and akanji could be interesting, seem to be pretty decent In the air and quick (as far as our CBs go). 

Actually trying to think, aside from the mahrez grealish combo (like them on individually though), if there is a player in the team currently I'd dread seeing on. Obviously Gomez and Palmer are still depth options but I wouldn't dread seeing them, they seem to handle themselves, Gomez especially seems decent, Great technique and doesn't seem rattled when he's on the ball. Palmer plays it safe when he has opportunity sometimes but genuinely wouldn't be upset seeing him play at the minute and that probably comes down to experience, better to not lose the ball and show pep you're capable, then get a little more leash to show off 

Tldr: decent squad we got.",Team is phenomenal. The squad refresh is going just according to plans,Akanji with 10/10 performance. He needs to start against spurs. pls pep,Rodri is bossing it,
28,Why the fuck are we not passing to haaland,We have scored 5/17 goals that Newcastle have conceded this year.,"What a beautiful second half performance!! That press was ridiculous, it mentally broke Arsenal.

Haaland is my MOTM. No 9 masterclass.
He didn't leave a single ball uncontested, was incredibly physical with the defenders and usually made the right decision with the ball, and that finish *chefs kiss*.

His effort was so fun to watch",I’m gonna admit it. Earlier this season I was doubting if Grealish was at the level to play for us. I now think he’s one of the best players in this team. Can’t remember the last time he lost the ball without being fouled.,Good win,"I was at the game today. Few things, we dominated the ball in the build up phase. However, we had no cutting-edge, nothing at all. No line breaking runs/ balls played, no shots from the edge of the box. 

We looked like we had no ideas, like at all. 

Ps- away fans are unreal btw, non stop singing love you blues, head up","Just hit long balls to haaland offside and have him shield it for Julian Alvarez operating as a shadow striker, bang fucking easy league then with these new fucking rules.","Nathan fucking Ake... holy shit. I was more impressed with him pocketing Saka all day than that RIDICULOUSLY good goal. He got a thing for Cup games this season right?? Huge shout Ortega also, what a performance! can we please go Haaland/Alvarez up front at the Emirates from the start?? 

I am officially confused now about if my pizza was lucky or not. I shunned it after Stones got hurt (kept eating of course) but then we won the game.... sooooooo idk if its good or bad luck. The only thing I truly know is that it was delicious and I am excited that I will have leftover for days.","Sergio Gomes is still such a ways off our pace, and Cancelo really looks out of form at the moment. Quite a worrying state of affairs. Really destabilising to our balance, and that showed today.","Pep post-match standup: ""It's a process... still we are far away from the top of the league"" (Narrator: ""they were two points away"") [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sXUZax3TaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sXUZax3TaA)",KDB was such a disappointment today,Up next: Chelsea 💀,"About as perfect an FA Cup game as you'd hope for.

Nothing to read in to this, bring on the next game!",I'd call the referee dogshit but I feel like that is offensive to dogs.,Just go look at Manchester City’s Instagram and the picture of Ortega.

OUR 97 WILL  
WIN US THE LEAGUE  
  
definitely ahead of myself but I'm super stoked on Josh and I hope im not the only one",also next comes the inevitable loss in the dead rubber vs sevilla lmao,"Probably fortunate to get the point today. Just didn’t see a lot of fight and urgency. Julian was on an island all night and got almost no service (even before the red card). Gomez and Mahrez were quite shaky before they were sent off/removed. The worst part is we looked so passive in possession for a majority of the first 30 minutes—and we have seen that all too much in the past. Not only was it boring football, we created no real chances. Riyad and Jack do not run at players. I wonder if this is what they are coached, but I doubt it. Either way, Cancelo have more of an attacking mindset in the final third than wingers not named Foden/Silva. Thankfully Haaland will be back on Sunday and he seems to always push the team to be direct.",I was at the game and I feel like Man City got lucky to win this game. Defense was atrocious and passing was also terrible.,"That finish from Haaland is still replaying on a loop in my mind.

The pass from Joao and finish from Erling genuinely gave me chills.

That's one of the few goals ever I leapt up in disbelief not only at how incredible but just.... how on earth is that even humanly possible.

That was incredible.

That game was a rollercoaster.

From sleepwalking the first half to playing out of their bodies in the second.

Please Pep. Start making subs sooner and recognize when Jack and Mahrez aren't contributing.

But Haaland & Cancelo ( even Stones) ... My god. Insane.
I love this team.

Haaland found a way to score even though he was a bit off today.,Jack Grealish has arrived,Forest are about to put 4 players on haaland next game,"If Julian Alvarez doesn’t play next game, we riot.","Love winning the early kick off on a Saturday, now you can just relax and see how the other games play out.",Insanely boring for ederson,"Watched Gomez progressively gel into the team.  Excellent performance. Ruben Dias inspiring too coming forward.
A little bit concerned about how many aerial duels we lose tho.  It sounds stupid but I also think we need to be more clinical In front of goal
Apart from that, not too bad.",Halaand x KDB. Rest of the league is fucked!,
29,"ederson did pretty well this game. made a really good save right before we conceded. since nobody wants to pass to haaland, we should just try that liverpool shit alisson and salah do and just ping the ball straight to haaland from ederson","Just finished watching as I was working. What a weird game. Couldn't believe we were 1-0 up at HT with all the chances Newcastle created. Second half was not good enough, it only felt like a matter of time before they'd equalise — and then Bernardo scores. I'm not entirely sure how we kept a clean sheet but I'll take it. Foden was on another level, especially 1st half, lovely to see.","Game delayed because the Queen died, there’s definitely a new monarch on the throne. Arise, King Kev","Attack was good. Defence again suspect , a lot of side and back passing going on between ake , akanji and dias and definitely struggling to break through the lines. A team with a better press would have put a lot more pressure on goal. Need Laporte and Stones back for their passing.   
Decent Cameo from Perrone , Philips needs more time and probably will start vs Bristol",That pub in Bristol can fuck off.,"Our midfield and last third game is too predictable. There's no pace unfortunately. Hopefully, Pep is gonna shake things up soon.","When even r/soccer is on our side,you know it's a really shit decision","Great performances from Graelish , Ake , Rodri, Alvarez and Ortega somewhat. Solid defensive work from all of them too , hopefully Stones injury isnt major. A lot of long balls played directly to Haaland today , wonder if that was just for Arsenal or something Pep wants to try out more. Special shoutout to the ref for being terrible",Missing ruben dias now,"Good response, and a good performance all day. I'll definitely take it. Now let's see if the rags can do us a favor.",What’s happened to offense is the best type of defense? Pep is slowly becoming even more pragmatic,"We swerved Cucurella, he got toasted tonight","That was easy. I expected a little bit of resistance considering the starting XI changes!

Everyone played perfectly, but I have to admit Mahrez was brilliant. Created and scored goals for fun. Toyed with the chelsea defense. Love it.","We tried to out shite them, but their regression is crazy. Without VVD and Konate, they are a mid table club.",Horrible Performance. Concerning just how many times we've had to come back from a goal or more down this season. We've been able to get points things but Pep needs to change a few things during the break,"The worst Liverpool team in years and we still lost to them. 

I am so disappointed in Canceló today. He rarely is the one to commit mistakes, but today he was down in the slumps. He gave Salah the easiest run of his life.

He had some fantastic moves though.,Would have been so good for Grealish if he scored today. He played really well!,Man if you watch after match pep talking to kdb and silva about tactics you can see passion of this guy even after team won he is not satisfied,Really disappointing game. The players didn't seem fully up for it and Pep should've done more to change things after Villa leveled it (if not earlier when we looked devoid of ideas). Annoying stuff all around,Jack said put some respect on my mf name after y’all were talking spicy,"Cheat codes that, Haaland and Alvarez…Alvarez goals remind me of Kun :)","Most stand out for me tonight was Gomez and Akanji. Both looks like they fit in the team, didnt look too out of place. I think Gomez got a little overwelhmed a couple times but outside of that he was good, got forward on the attack a couple times as well. Akanji was just solid. Nothing crazy, but tonight was a night where he didnt need to be, just did what he was suppose to. 

I like Phil on the right. He is more fluid getting on the ball and driving at people. On the left he tends to get stood up too easily. 

Haaland. 

Kevin seemed to have a very mediocre night outside of the assist but with the team set up like it is now he can have an off night and its not the end of the world.","I thought Rodri was magnificent today, the way he controlled the game, the interceptions, just so commanding in the middle of the pitch.",

So many bizarre decisions being made on what seems like a weekly basis.","Stunt on them time wasting cunts. I loved every bit of that shithousery, seeing Newcastle players rattled is what I needed to see. Those mfers just get away with so many pushes/fouls, they couldn’t do shit when we pressed them hard","Commentary banging on about us having a massive squad.  Uhh what. 

1 senior RB, 5 senior CBs, 0 senior LBs

2 CDMs, 3 CMs

1 RW, 2 LWs, 2 ST

Then there’s really 2 academy players (Rico + Palmer). 

That’s not a massive squad. Pep just does really well by rotating them and enabling them to play in multiple positions.",Should satisfy the “if we aren’t battering them by half time we are playing shit” crowd.,Big dick Bernardo,"Without De Bruyne, we play so slow and lethargic, I was bored as shit watching us pass side to side.","No one even tries to play a through ball for Haaland. He makes so many good runs. He must be getting frustrated.


Even if we loose the ball, it would be easier to defend since not everyone would be high up the pitch.","Hopefully Stones isn’t too injured. I will take a 1-0 against the current league leaders and a spot in the 5th round. I’m assuming we’re already pegged in for a road game against the toughest remaining club, so we will most likely be headed to Liverpool while the rags host either Wrexham or Stevenage if they get through.",The academy wingers could surely do a job for the first team if Pep and them don’t decide to buy any during January,Lovely,A game I'd like to forget,"Yeah, what a game.

That first half was strange in terms of the formation, don't know why we had Cancelo and Walker, I was so worried we'd hurt ourselves which we nearly did when Cancelo and Walker lost possession because they were in each other's way. We were fortunate not to concede when Chelsea hit the post.

That 2nd half was better, and we started on the front foot. We needed those subs, and boy did it work out, the Grealish-Mahrez duo worked, although that's because Chelsea were coming at us instead of being ultra defensive.

I've had my sayings about Grealish, but one thing I've never said is that I want him to never play again, I've always wanted him to be good and he has shown something these past couple of games so I can't find any reason to say anything else but well done to Jack because when he came on, he looked like he was trying.

John was amazing at the back. He did not put his foot wrong, and that tackle on Pulisic was well timed.

KDB had a bad game, and he hasn't looked good in a few games, but it's not like we've seen a good performance from the team overall in some time bar individual brillance as our striker. He's still the best player in the league, so I won't find reason to worry too much. Perhaps he needs a rest, which he'll get this weekend against Chelsea again in the FA cup.

Seriously though, I don't know what Pep was thinking really because that was so confusing.We still need wingers, though. Alvarez needs to get more game time, too, although perhaps Pep is giving more rest since he did just win the World Cup three weeks ago.

Onto Chelsea and then the Manchester derby, the latter of the two is going to be so important, especially since Arsenal are playing Spurs as well. Hopefully we begin to play better and with more of a threat in attack instead of just hoping Haaland gets on the end of a chance even though that is what he does best but it makes predictable for the most part.","Good minutes for Foden, Walker, Alvarez, Laporte. 90 minutes off for Kevin, Gundo, and Haaland. 4 goals and a clean sheet. Only less than stellar parts might be Gomez and Palmer were solid but not impressive. Tough to ask for more.","Despite a defensively terrible performance, we got the win against the bin dippers which is a great start to the tough fixtures we have ahead.

The front 5 was quite good overall and De Bruyne just looked at it and sharp as always and man, I really did forget at least for a bit that we have Haaland so it was awesome to see him score yet again as if the world cup didn't happened.

Overall, we can be better but the squads barely had enough time to get everyone back together to prepare for our next games so I definitely think we'll be better for it.","im fucking tired of playing fucking centrebacks at fullbacks man, fuck","Lets not act like liverpool haven’t been second best for years and a thorn in our side.

They could cure insomnia,Mad how Haaland has a bad game and still scores,"Kind of glad that Gomez's shot didn't go in there at the end, because I was massively tempted to put £100 on those 14/1 odds for us to win 6:0 and ultimately didn't.",What an incredible comeback. Hopefully this is the last week of Walker in the midfield. It’s not working and it also clogs up the left and doesn’t leave Foden or Cancelo any space to make something happen.,"Just didn’t seem up for it today. Poor all round. It happens, but can’t have too many days like this, this season.

I said it in the match thread, but it just didn’t feel like the intensity we see when you know a goal is coming, was there today.",Where are the Grealish haters. Nvm found them,Alvarez and Haaland need to play together more,"Solid performance from Sergio Gomez, Akanji and Phillips with his crazy sniper precision passes!","Alright, great game. First half we were slow and methodical, didn't risk much at all but kept a tight grasp of the game. Second half started iffy, we were making mistakes, giving possession away, but the defence was quite solid and after the second goal we took control again. Some things I noticed...

Walker was a lot more inverted, sometimes Cancelo too. Often times Walker becomes part of the back line as a third CB but here he was sitting in that defensive midfield role, and often it was Rodri dropping whilst Dias went wider right. 

Jack and Cancelo on the left is a stunted combo. Both great players and maybe they can figure out a way to make it work, but neither are penetrative, both want runners in and around them. Something Pep did against Bayern in pre-season actually happened again here when Bernardo was brought on. Cancelo stayed a little further back, sometimes invreting to sit as Zinchenko or Walker was doing, and it was Bernardo who was now free, not having to sit with Rodri, who started overlapping on Jacks side and there was a lot more action, I thought. 

Haaland just has petrifying pace. Something that big should not be that quick. His first goal I seriously didn't think he was getting there and he got there *first* the second goal was what everyone has been talking about with him. It's so nice to have such active movement on the defensive line like we used to have with Aguero. 

Gundogan was great also. He looked like he was strolling through that game at times controlling everything, shades of David Silva. 

Grealish was fine. He didn't really get much joy at all up against Coufal, but I can't remember him being dispossessed at all tbh. As I was saying, he either needs to start wider, to stretch that backline out, or have someone overlap him to pull apart the defence in front of him. It was often 2 v 3 out there and he couldn't do much but recycle it back through Rodri.

Speaking of, Rodri was also brilliant. Basically did everything he needed to. Whilst Kevin was a bit off, despite his assist (one of many to come I hope) the duo of Rodri and Gundogan was imperious (imagine saying that a couple seasons ago)

Our defence was really solid, Ake was winning headers like nobodies business and whilst Dias was maybe making a mistake here or there I mostly remember him forcing Scamacca offside late. 

**TL;DR -** So yeah, all in all great game for us, great start. West Ham away is a tough tough game and we strangled them. Two goals for Haaland is immense. Solid defensively. We look to be trying one or two things with our fullback structure which is interesting.",
31,"Edi did well and made one mistake, so I will take that for sure but I’m tired of blaming him when the rest of the field doesn’t want to win( there are a few exceptions) just bored of this team.

I must say I don't like when both fullbacks play inside. Got to be just one or neither imo.","Clean sheet, no injuries and a much better second half defensively. 

Totally get that Pep wants Mahrez to find his form and I think that’s important. It just makes sense to still get Palmer more minutes. He could’ve easily subbed Cole on at half time or the 60th minute. Riyad looked off throughout the game and I think leaving him on may have done more damage this game. I just think it’s pointless to get Cole on in the 88th minute.","Akanji was class defensively, piss poor offensively. Can’t blame him playing out of position.","Good 3p. But please for the love of god stop this CB's at L/RB-experiments. Its gonna give me a god damn heartattack. Please get a real PROVEN RB (i think Joao works best at LB) in the next window.
Walker isnt getting any younger and when he out injured, it shows. Im tired of pretending it doesnt.

Same with playing Grealish - Mahrez at the same time.. for me FODEN has to play every single game hes fit. 

Thats my two cents. Just so happy for the 3p this game, felt like City had a real off-day. Almost every chance Brighton had was cuz of major mistakes by City players.

It was on tonight as well. I’ve never found the name of the song!,"Thoughts on the match

Dortmund really came out to play behind the ball and we just couldn't break them down. I commend them for execution by their backline. Schlotterback in particular looked like a very good get for them. They looked good on the counter in the first half as well, and with some extra finishing they should've taken points from us.

City looked lifeless in the first half. I thought the changes pep made were fine at half, they breathed some life into the pitch in only the way Bernardo can. I thought the synergy of Cancelo and Foden really needed to be our creative point in the first half but they both looked off.

Major talking point of the game is no doubt the play of Riyad Mahrez. He hasn't been in form for awhile now but there's two things going on here. 1: he's old and maybe losing a step. I think it's going to be a major point in the summer window to really pursue a winger who can bring some pace to that side, potentially right footed as well so we can get some better crossing opportunities.

At the same time, my second point here is that this whole makeshift RB situation is NOT working. Playing Stones and Akanji on the right is brutal for Mahrez who wants to cut inside because he has no outlet making the overlap on the outside. Mahrez doesn't have the speed to make runs on the outside there and since Stones and Akanji are CBs they don't have the pace or crossing ability to make runs either. 

At the end of they day we got the result we needed. I saw people in the thread slamming subbing off Haaland. No sense in keeping him in running him into the ground. We got the result we needed, and tactically Silva helped us more no doubt. 

Frustrating watch.",Wouldn’t mind picking their keeper up as back up. The guy is extremely talented and would be more of a challenge for our number 1 spot.,It was so quiet in the Etihad today. It felt like we couldn’t be bothered to get behind the lads. Not sure whether it’s an issue of legacy fans struggling for tickets or what?,Foden - Haaland- Alvarez needs to be out front three if we wanna be serious this season,"It should've been 6-7 but 3 points what matter the most i can't really complaints and i'm happy for Mahrez to get his goal, Haaland was bit unlucky not to scored more and he should just making an attempt to goal rather than try to round the goalkeeper, Grealish on the other hand seriously need to practice finishing and shooting more because we need him to be clinical as well and Cancelo was immense undoubtedly MOTM for today.",Looking very forward to the reverse fixture. Hopefully Cole and Gomez get starts in all the remaining group stage games. Rico.. 17?!,"Bernardo Silva started of bright scoring and assisting last season as well when KDB was injured 

He is doing the same this season 

When KDB is off Silva provides",foden really let 47 year old ashley young pocket him ffs,Not a fantastic performance but certainly plenty of positives beyond the obvious 3 points and clean sheet. Grealish was really good. Akanji is going to be huge for us - I can't believe we signed him almost as an afterthought because he's played a big role already. KdB continues his quest for a new assist record despite not playing very well overall. Haaland on the score sheet (of course).

Love the pair of them,"Jack Grealish is so immensely important to this team. Without him, we get pressed back and into the sidelines routinely. We are slow and methodically predictable. We lack presence in the middle attacking third of the pitch as Rodri is usually deep, Haaland is high, and our outside mids are wide. The result is that we are very easy to press bc we can be pushed to the sideline, causing us to cycle the ball back until finally Ederson hits (at best) a 50/50 ball to Haaland or someone in space. Happened all first half and has stagnated our offense all season. 

Then there is Jack mfing Grealish, who can track back along his sideline and work the ball to the middle of the pitch and into space with his feet. None of our wingers or mids take that “dead end” pass and turn it into something like he does. Everyone else will drop it back into the defense, it’ll cycle around, our shape will get pushed back, finally Ederson, etc.

I have no clue what can be done about it -- Pep is trying to play him out of his funk, but it just doesn't look like it's going to happen.

We want him to sign that contract extension maybe think about playing him. And Foden maybe could have helped the game with his directness and trying something out of nowhere. Well good thing it's still a draw, all to play for at the Etihad. Come on City!","Really happy with that, front 3 was amazing today.",So glad to have Ruben back in the team!,"We have to make sure to keep Rico Lewis, Foden, Akanji, Peronne and Alvarez for as long as we can.

We are also allergic to clean sheets.",(Not So) Fun Fact: This is our first clean sheet of the month.. its the last day of the month..,"They've been playing ""not to lose"" for a while now. Players scared to make decisive passes, too many touches on the ball. What Pep has failed to realize is that playing some new experimental formation where almost everyone is playing out of position is ABSOLUTELY NOT the way out of that problem.",Maybe the World Cup has cut off everybody's momentum. I can't explain this otherwise. It's as if we genuinely don't want to win the league. Or maybe the 17-22 madness with Liverpool was more tiring than we realize and Pep granted his players an off-season.,"Wouldn't mind seeing more of rcm Bernardo

Saucy cameo",Definitely a few names from tonight I don’t want to see anywhere near the starting XI in the derby.,Nice to see KDB back to something closer to pre World Cup levels. Still a few passes going astray uncharacteristically. Think pep did well dropping him for a game.,[deleted],"Johnny Boulders MOTM by a mile, Kevin was off it today","It's been a while since we've beaten a team like that, the fluidity of the front 3 helped out a lot too but great performance all around.",Soooo who’s left?,would love to see more dias starting again.,"He did it… All this talk the week leading to it must have done it. They just wanted it more. Weirdly passive game from us. As if Arsenal and Tottenham aren’t there and we are just 10 points clear of Liverpool in second and play the long game (we might still, will see at the end I guess). No one player had a particularly bad game either. Cancelo’s mistake is just that - an odd mistake in a bad moment. KDB had an off day, I never saw “tying his shoe laces” Kevin… I’ve said it before but I feel more and more afraid of it - we are too dependent on him, and becoming too dependent on Haaland up front. I do wish he sits on the bench for a couple of games. Records are cool and all but the team needs to realize that we can score without him too. I think it would be good to him as well as it would free his mind, no way he doesn’t feel the pressure of having to score, getting at the end of every single attack we have. Nice thing is they feel the fire under their asses as well, especially Nunez. Dude wasted a couple of chances by trying to finish himself which was hilarious. Start Alvarez more, get Mahrez to form again, let Grealish run at people and move Cancelo back to the left!",Do yourself a favour and read the Liverpool subreddit rival watch thread,"My take aways:

1. Lewis is first team quality

2. Ortega had a world class performance. He  could be our new Willy Caballero and can push for starting position at this rate

3. Amazing game from Grealish, any other keeper and he’s on the scoresheet

4. Very strong chemistry for a B team, I was a bit worried about that going into this game.

5. We need to stop falling asleep defensively once we think victory is secured. Champions league nights will be cruel to us

6. New club, same old Sterling 

Overall, great game, nobody had any stinkers. We keep going",Have that one simeo- I mean Rogers,"Silva is pure class 

Really helped City both attack and defence",Swear I got chills watching his celebration,"Not really too upset about this game. In the grand scheme of things, it's better to play at a low intensity for 90 minutes today so that we have more energy for games that actually matter. We got the draw that we needed which is the ideal outcome.

I'm choosing to look positively at Mahrez's performance, in that hopefully this gives Pep food for thought when it comes to Palmer. Maybe we'll see him start a meaningful match soon.","We had to fight for that 1 point. Not the best night, but with just ten men for more than an hour, it's cool. Could have been worse.","It's wasn't something new for Ederson to make a pin point long ball for goal and let one in through the near post 

What would be Pep's thought on Ederson today ?",Kalvin is a gangster. Boulders has boulders. Erling is unnatural. We went out to win they came in to draw,"I really think as a supersub 

Mahrez >> grealish. 

As a starter 

Grealish >= Mahrez. 

But the weird thing about all of this is that the case was the opposite last season.",Jack and cole controlling the game in second half was a joy to watch,"I loved the come back in today's game but idk why Pep is continously playing Walker a CDM role, Rodri plays better long passes than Walker any day.

Walker is solid as RB and and plays decently as a CB.

Haaland getting a hat-trick, watching Bernado, KDB, Alvarez, Foden, Gundo and Haaland attack all together was just insane.

We March on! Cmon City!!",Foden and Walker needs to be benched for a few games. Very very poor performance from them lately,Players were clearly just trying to conserve as much energy as possible. Glad Haaland doesn't have to deal with that world cup bs too.,[deleted],"My friend, a Sevilla fan, told me we'd win easy probably by 4 or 5. He was correct. Akanji looks decent, despite not being tested at all, reads the game well and comfortable with either foot. Liked gomes too, an actual LB. Do think he'll get targeted because of his size but he seemed feisty. 4 goals, 3 points and a run out for some fringe players, good night all round. Plan for rest of the season give it to kev, he'll give it to haaland, who will score, simple.","Grealish, Rodri, Cancelo, Walker, Foden, Gündogan and Haaland all brilliant today.

Haaland is fucking rapid.",

Well done Blues.,"I'm not English so don't @ me with the national bias, but god damn Grealish has been immense these last weeks. Unlucky when scoring, but still an amazing workrate, never negative, always going at players. I'm not surprised Foden cannot get a start in, although I do wish we'd manage to get them to play together. Foden in the midfield?","Enjoyed the game, lacked a little bit of control late in the second half but our attacking play was so much better. 

I think Eddie did well today too.",Ok performance against a midtable Championship team,"Not this game in general. But even when we won before, it wasn’t very convincing this season. Maybe I’m used to watching city dominate the ball as it was an essential recipe to win given how much had to be created with all the false 9 and double false 9. 
I don’t blame pep. No one knows the game better than him. But to win anything this season is a hard ask. No doubts about the next season, changes will come and holes will be filled.",Can't keep relying on other team's to do us favors man that's not how u win titles.,Ake 🐐,"I really want to like gomez but he sure is making it hard to , also concerning to see how poor cancelo was today. Cant blame walker since not his natural position but still very bad passing. Philips and Foden didnt look upto speed at all , cant fault alvarez since he didnt have anything to do. A really poor first half , but atleast its in the Carabao so less games for city to play. Encouraging second half though even if still not good . Probably Ake and Walker should be fullback for the derby , Mahrez and Graelish on the wings.  


Also must give a bit of recognition to Graelish and Laporte for basically being the only people who seemed to be switched on in that first half",Good win. Exactly what we needed. Praying for an Arsenal-United draw and hopefully we beat them back down to earth home and away.,"Were struggling to create at the moment and that leaves us open to the counter. Seen it too many times already this season,  some changes need to be made.","For as absolutely batshit insane as that game was. I actually had a lot of fun watching that lmao. 

Crazy first half. Not sure what Pep was trying, obviously to stop the counter-attack? Walker and Ake as our wide CBs but neither is particularly great in progression and that's where the ball was a lot so we suffered quite a bit. 

Cancelo at RW was...something. I don't know if it was because Pep really wants to give him minutes or he was ready to play but Pep doesn't want him on the left anymore. 

Anyway, second half. Way better. Great to see Pep make changes but in fairness, it makes sense. He doesn't like making changes when the rhythm of the match is good, it obviously wasn't here so he was happy to make changes, so don't expect him to keep doing it in games we dominate the ball but don't make many chances. 

Absolutely love that Jacky boy got another asisst, that's 3 in 3 now? good for him. I hope it continues, perfect pass, perfectly placed. And Rico Lewis is a fucking diamond. 

Away fans were immense all game. GET IN CITY.","One of, if not the best performance this season so far.

Had to watch it on a shitty stream while on the train tho 🫡","Rico Lewis and Nathan Ake were great today. Rico's tackle on Salah as last man was brilliant. 

Waiting for Premier League to start.

C'mon City!","Multiple players with their heads seemingly not in it today. Kev missed so many passes, Ederson was the only reason we weren’t even more embarrassed at home.","christ some of the comments in the match threads were such a huge overreaction. Here's a balanced take:

Cancelo had a very poor game. If he played his normal game we wouldn't have conceded. Maybe because he was playing on the right rather than left. 

Bernardo was our best player, he was everywhere. 

KDB was quieter than normal. 

Foden was decent. 

Haaland didn't get many chances and Van Dijk and Gomez kept him quiet. 

Klopp is so unlikeable he's perfect for liverpool.

Also, it's anfield, we've not won there in the league for fucking ever. Like 2 wins in 20 attempts. Pep has never won there. You guys who thought we were gunna walk it because they had been in bad form are straight up delusional.",That took several weeks off my life.,"Is it me or does Lewis remind you all of Jesus Navas? Both pacey, undersized and a bit of a liability on defense, but damn do they put in a shift running up and down the pitch.",Emo Kev saves the day!! Ederson also incredible today.

That was some top tier perfection,"* Akanji is a solid signing!!
* Lowkey feel for Alvarez. Whenever he comes on as a sub, the game is already won and others try to go for goal instead of passing it to him (PS: I saw Alvarez's brother on tele!)
* Grealish was good. But need better from him. He wasn't happy about being subbed off and hoping that makes him want to do better
* Ederson got away with one there.","Just a standard city performance with the 235 and the Inverted-full backs, dominant from minute one Pep obviously had a plan for Gundogan which is why he started ahead of him and that is Gundogan is more an attacking threat than Bernardo is. He would have Gundogan and KDB as 2 high 8's in between the spaces causing the defence to have problems which is why we saw our wingers wide and unmarked for most of the game. Grealish was decent today but, his passing was a bit off today and was just missing that final delivery with his crosses.",

There were also times today we seemed to just forget we have a midfield, we are so obsessed with go up one wing, today the left, that we just go up a wing and blindly cross the ball into the box hoping it magically finds Haaland. We need to use the midfielders in the build up more often and for gods sake someone please pass Haaland the ball when he makes a run, thats how he got all those goals to start the season.","Atleast we got the w, still aren't where we should be if we want trophies at the end of the season but we saw out a tough game.",Potentially the worst I’ve seen us play since the Stuart Pearce era.,What’s happened to Dias?

I don’t think he’s gotten a minute of playing time since the World Cup.,"for the love of God, pep  please don't start both grealish and Mahrez on same line up. it is a recipe for disaster. Grealish is mid table player nothing new about it.

Could beat the record for most goals a season at this point

Also happy for Alvarez and his first brace, and the whole team just played really well, great great game","What a game. 

Akanji is a great addition. Think he'd suit very well in a 3ATB with his runs into the midfield.

Gomez got some whippage but can be dragged out of position quite quickly it seems - sure it's nothing some Training and experience can iron out

Phillips another with the Crosses, did think his positioning to be available for passes was sometimes off. Stuck behind a man not being available.

Alvarez sadly no goal but a nice outting and the man can press a mistake.

Someone explain what eddy did to give away a goal, and why it was overturned

Foden RW is a great shout (my RW raheem idea was correct)

Palmer.. looked good very up for it. He had a few times on the edge of the box with the ball static taking his time looking for a pass or a way around. Feel like that woulda been punished against a more up for it opposition. Unlucky to get his shot blocked.

Cancelo looked better, more himself, out right.

The only cross of quality led to the opening goal and no surprise it came from him.

The other attempts by others were just awful and I'm sure Haaland was getting frustrated.

Initially I thought the foul on Grealish was a stone Waller but I was watching the game on my iPad and Andy Gray, keys and mccateer didn't think it was.

Boy does Keys hate the way city play. A bit ott but he did have a point

I did think there was a definite foul on Traore or Lemina in the lead up to the incident that was not given so not upset.

What makes my blood boil is the disallowing of goals cos of very dubious offside calls.

Mahrez was more onside than Alvarez who was allowed to go on and take a shot.

The same linesman put his flag up against Mahrez who in my view was level but that goal was disallowed.

Forget Var as it was not an ""obvious error"". Every error the incompetent jackasses make is obvious.

I see Pep has not lost the knack of annoying me with his subs.

At Barcelona he used to frustrate me by taking off Villa while Messi who has scored 100  goals was still on the pitch.

Don't care what anyone says Haaland needed this hat trick and would have preferred being on the pitch.

He can't be tired as he didn't go to the world cup and he is 22 or thereabouts.

I don't get why Cancelo, Walker and Foden are not given minutes to get their form back.

Baffling that Dias was given minutes either. Laporte at left back or seemingly 4th choice centre back ain't something I agree with 

These are the guys that are crucial in city's quest for cl glory.","These ratings have to be a joke

Loving Alvarez .... City is just so much more dangerous when he's out there. He brings so many little things that end up making a huge difference. That press... so good. Things are def slower with Haaland... Hoping Pep can figure out how to make Foden Haaland Alvarez work because wow, that would be such a dangerous trio up front.","Couldn’t watch, how was the game?","I hate Stones at right back , offers nothing going forward and usually back passes or side passes when in the final third.

Loved the front 4 and Rico","I was particularly interested in how Philips plays, okayish first half but really good second half.  Shows he needs more game time and I would really expect him to pick up next season , first year under Pep always tough

Premier League soon come was great I wish Bernardo had just shit it instead of passing would have been such a good goal","Last season with the false 9, multiple players were going for goals, trying to open up opportunities.

It wasn’t a single person, stop shitting on Phillips although I will say after that red card Gomez got last year he has been a truly shit option, the whole team EVEN THE SUBS were truly abysmal.

""WORST: Rodri, Manchester City

The Manchester City midfielder played with an unusual lack of discipline. He kicked out at Carvalho in the first half and wildly overreacted to a Fabinho challenge. Rodri should have been sent off with two yellow cards.""","We deserved to lose! No one tried today. Better take the loss now and learn about the wingers, right back problems we have. I’m confident Pep isn’t just ignoring the less chance creation and horrendous corners we take, where is the city that had so many corner kick goals last season!",Pep has too much respect for Liverpool. What a joke that we couldn’t win,Please stay forever Bernardo,"Despite the result our performance was very questionable. Just happy to get the result as, going into this match, I was sort of resigned to the fact that we were likely to lose given that rotation tends to impact our performance more than it does other teams because of Pep's system. I would have been okay with going out to Chelsea but we got it over the line. Can't really ask for more!

Difficult to pick MotM between Grealish and Ortega but I feel you gotta give it to Ortega despite how amazing Grealish was. Stefan saved us from conceding 4+ goals; contributions don't get more important than that.",Good results considering we played against a team park the bus for 80 minutes lol,I wouldn't take the last 2 goals they scored to heart.

I'm still Euphoric.,Can’t imagine lif……… uh football without him,"Stayed up late for this, should have just slept honestly after seeing the lineup","I see this as a win for us. We held on with 10 men, while still attacking.  Yes Mahrez had an off day, and maybe Mahrez and Graelish combo isn't the best fit for alvarez. 

In a UCL game holding on with 10 men for more than a hour is a job well done.

Obligatory VAR handball decisions (both) were horrendous",We looked poor in the second half. Other than the goal kev was way off it. Mahrez is finished.

So solid and such a nice and intelligent guy. Diamond in the rough I’d say. What a buy.,Can haaland score in all 6 games of UCL group stage,"The last two matches have demonstrated just how much energy it takes to beat us. Both palace and Newcastle played 45 mins of excellent football, only to run out of gas fairly quickly in the second half. Think we’ll see a lot of results where we battle back and slowly wear the opponents down",I felt city would far too narrow mainly due to the inverted fullbacks. Foden is more effective inside so having a left footed left back (Gomez) on the pitch providing width would help with that. Similar to how bringing on Zinchenko last game of last season made a big difference,"Ah not the best performance, we slowed down a lot after the second goal but it was a perfect win. 0-3, doesn't get more comfortable than that. I'm sure we'll come out stronger in the derby!","It’s been a while since I’ve been this excited about watching us play. Yes the defending has been a bit questionable against Newcastle and Palace, but knowing we have such an amazing attacking force up front it just makes me tingle and grin from ear to ear now watching us play! C’mon City!!! 😁😁", I loved this game. Good job lads.,Imagine bringing on the workrate of Bernardo and Alvarez around the 60-70 minute mark lmao,
44,"That feels like a loss. what a frustrating game. 

You just know when its 1-0 in the 2nd half, that the game will end 1-1. This team has no killer instinct (especially on the road) to get that 2nd goal. The dropped points are killing us. 

Once the other team makes adjustments in the 2nd half, they always score. Pep refuses to counter any subs the other teams make... and it's costing the team. This is an older team..... and the legs are really starting to show. Kev is almost 32, Gundo is 32, Mahrez is 32, Bernardo is 29.... not to mention the world cup in the middle of the season! These guys can't play 90 every game. Rodri also is getting to the dead phase in this season cause he legit can't get any rest. I just want to see some subs at like minute 70.... why is that so difficult??? 

I really feel for Haaland. He looked so frustrated today. I cannot for the life of me understand why no one seems to give a fuck that he's on the pitch. Has Bernardo passed to him this whole season??? KDB is the only one who looks for him, and when he's not there, might as well bench Haaland. Foden and Alvarez try, but they can't get game time. Gundo doesn't seem to find him, and none of the Wingers do. We might as well be playing with 10 men. 

Good game from Jack but I hate him out on the wing. He's not dynamic enough out there, and I feel like teams genuinely don't care if he just keeps the ball out on the wing by himself with no overlaps on every drive. 

Ederson was NOT TO BLAME for that goal. I thought he did a good job today. It's not his fault that Gvardiol jumped half way over Dias on a set piece. Why wasn't the coverage better there ??

Can also just say... I don't care how it happens... get Gvardiol to the Etihad in a Man City shirt next season. 

That just wasn't good enough today. Dead formation and 0 effort to find Haaland or to score. Without that costly turnover by Leipzig, we might have lost 1-0.",Clean sheet!,TOP OF THE LEAGUE!!!! The boys in sky blue are top of the league!!!,"The only gripe today was phillips and the goal we conceded. Other than that, just what we needed","We need be tough in defense, today Akanji and Dias were too soft. We need to kill people with tackles, we need Stones and Dias/Laporte partnership for hard tackles I think. I don’t know how to put it but our CB’s aren’t scary to face against, that being said NATHAN AKE is fcking massive.","Top 3 Man City Curses

Might have misheard some bits though","IDK if I got this from Sam Lee's podcast  but, a somewhat conspiratorial/humorous  theory behind why Pep is so focused on control is because he almost mimicking a Jose style of football.

Bang in a goal or two and shut the game down via possession and reduce chances being created for opposition (Which ironically also reduces our chances). Its not pretty football, its not supposed to be, but it grinds out results.

Don't take this too seriously tho, it was something said in passing.",Don’t play with that Kit again,"On the other hand, I refuse to believe Phillips is a City player.

On to the next,"Feeling a bit more confident about this cup now that most of the good teams are out. 

Mahrez the king of playing shit 90 minutes but scoring a goal so you can't talk shit about him in the post match thread.

Palmer is the most skillful player we have in this team. He's impressed me and I find it weird how harsh people seem to be on him.

Rico Lewis could be something special too.

Everybody played well for us even if Rico had a shaky first half. Great performances by Ortega and grealish,Well that was a fucking pain in the arse. A moment of magic from KDB got us all 3 points in what looked like a game we'd drop points. Alvarez just not clicking with the other forwards yet. Also that own goal we nearly scored late on make me shit myself. Any way 3 points and top of the table is all that matters.,"Without Rodri, our defence got leaky in second half. Luckily the game was finished early.","He was amazing. He has that tiny bit of controlled chaos in him too.  He still does not know how to challenge for the ball when his opponent's back is to him tho. But it looks funny when a 5'6 guy like him accidentally fouls a 6'2 cm or cb. 

I think he got a bit emotional too in the end but the kid is 17 and scored a UCL debut goal so understandable.",Tony Pulis wet dream.,Few that was a match of football. Shit we have Dortmund next.,"Performance was good in the first half. Dominated the game and got two well deserved goals. But the start in the second half was bad and we let Brighton get a lot of chances and they nearly equalised until De Bruyne got a goal we really needed. All in all, 3 points, more Haaland goals a certain team who wears red losing earlier today. Been a pretty good day.","Football is an easy game.

Really wish we still had wingers with pace. We need a big performance against united now.,God I love this guy,"Some thoughts from today, now I've had time to reflect
-We are far too reliant on BRILLIANCE from KDB.
-We need KP to step up ASAP because rodri has been so consistently good, an injury could damage our season.
-Pep playing grealish and Mahrez is very important.
Both didn't get as many minutes as foden and Alvarez(world cup) and with our January, it's likely they won't get many either.
-We always struggle and slip when the pitch is wet or when it's raining??????
-  Not an easy match to be over critical because it was an absolute stunner of an equaliser.  But it seems low blocks and high energy are still our biggest weakness (villa, Brentford, Everton, even Liverpool- didn't catch the Newcastle game).

Hopefully some big wins this month against top opposition will inspire the boys
Won't give up on the league,  hopefully the boys can pull it together and get us some more W's","good work from the defence, not sure it's because the right side was crowded but kyle and cancelo have to step it up","It's just nice for English football when a big side like ours plays a lesser team so that at least they and their fans get a chance to see what good football looks like. Really what the FA Cup is all about.

Too bad we're playing Arsenal next, I would have liked them to go deeper in all competitions to put more strain on their bench.","Grealish looks hesitant to dribble and create :/ that's what I got from his playing time today. He had a few 1v1s and he decided to pass out of them. 

I'm just a fat bum watching from the Tele so what do I know lol. I still love the lad","Kinda missed Walker with his pace, you replace stones with Walker in that lineup and we could've prevented a few chances but agreed, dreadful match today, was evident from the start... Felt we were less clinical in the opposition third with De Bruyne showing glimpses of himself, but couldn't really make a difference.. A few more subs might've helped but largely, I think we've got to be more patient and not go for crosses all the time... We have what it takes to be patient and move the ball around maybe a couple more times to look for a good chance... Good game for Bernardo and imo, even Haaland was good and probably should've bagged an assist or two today... About Haaland, it's usual for him to not be that involved in matches, when he scores or doesn't... We have to find and trust more outlets like Foden, Cancelo, De Bruyne, Gundogan..

The kid had basicly zero preseason and basicly hadn't played since the end of last season until he went to the WC.  Some players have bigger drop offs than others in performances when they don't play regularly. Pretty sure this was his first 90 minutes since the season started. I'd give him 4 or 5 more games with the team before we start to seriously evaluate if he belongs with the team or not. 

He was ok today. He had some really sharp, quick and aggressive passes down field that let us really get at their back line and make them uncomfortable. 

On the downside he had more than a few errant passes and got the ball taken from him once.

Good game, not great",In Copenhagen game can we start Alvarez,"I was gonna say, I had work so I couldn’t watch but when I checked in at the half on this thread the points I saw were:

1-We have created nothing for three games

2-Mahrez is Trash

3-Alvarez is not a suitable striker","The fact that I couldn’t find a stream that works was maybe a good thing, seemed like a boring and dull game that.","That first half was a disasterclass where so many things went wrong for us and we were pretty poor by our standards. But despite being a man down for most of the match away from home, we still got a point in the end, still unbeaten this season and have one foot in the next round. So not too bad all things considered. On to the big one on Sunday","Weird game

Some of our passing was absolutely awful, especially around the back line 

Ederson got an assist and made some great long passes but he was poor for the goal IMO, good save later on

Mahrez had a shocker I don’t know what his story is anymore, I’d be starting Alvarez over him

Halaand probably should have had a hattrick if the other peno was given, took his first goal well

Laporte made a lot of great blocks",Haaland is just Zlatan with hopefully an even better career,Due Speigel,"I need the possession stats for the last half hour 

Fun match. Someone give their keeper the match ball","I remember last season for the final match against Villa they were saying we had only come back from 2-0 in the prem once I believe. 

Oh how the times have changed, love this club and all of the beautiful bastards giving it everything on the pitch. 

Standouts: Silva, Haaland, Stones, Gomez, Gundo.","We can't win every match, but we do tend to win when Mahrez doesn't have his head up his ass.",Our attack and midfield were very sloppy in the second half we could have scored more than five if we were consistent while keeping the ball but still we won the match. Congratulations to the boys for their performance and I believe that we will keep this momentum until the end of the season.,"From having a lack of a lethal threat in goal to now this, what more could you possibly want. We use to complain about having chances wasted but now we have that unrelenting goal threat. 

Gomez looked like he's slotted in well and Palmer looked great when he came on. A brace for the 🕷️ too despite Haaland taking all the headlines. 

6-0!!

Could've easily been 8.",Lads I love the claret shorts with the blue kit. That is all.,City wins and plays well and United lose to a team everyone expects them to beat. Perfect Sunday,
48,Not.good.enough,"What a win!!! 

I can't pick if my MOTM was Foden or Ake.... god damn Ake has been SO GOOD this season, but the best part is his consistency. I feel like he never dips in quality. Foden coming back into form has helped this team so much. 4 goals in the last 3 games is outstanding. 

CLEAN SHEET!!! Very happy Ederson got his 100th PL clean sheet today, what an achievement. Even better that he iced it with a great save at the very end. 

Haaland didn't score, and did struggle with the tight coverage, but that had to be expected. Newcastle are the best defense in the league by far. His link up play is looking better, so he can still contribute when not scoring. Nice assist also. 

It cannot be understated how much this team has improved with Dias coming back into the line up. I look forward to Stones come back, and am still baffled as why Laporte has been shunned like he has. 

Rough one for KDB... I wonder if the World Cup is catching up to him. It's tough to see the drop off since he's been so wonderful for us for so many years. Maybe that has begun to taking its toll. I am not ready for a world without KDB. I think he could use a few games off and let Alvarez play that 10 behind Haaland, since its looked pretty damn good in the limited time we've seen it.  Perfect sub from Pep with Bernardo, who now has 2 goals against the best defense in the league.",De bruyne reminding everyone tonight,"Best front 3 is Alvarez Foden, Haaland.. so much more direct than grealish and mahrez, just simply look a more dangerous team",Foden was great and Jack getting subbed on buried Bristol,"We looked so easy to cut through today. Probably Rodri’s worst game didn’t help either. 

Feel like we need two holding midfielders that would allow us to play those riskier early through balls to Haaland. Don’t think we do it that often for that reason as Pep wants control and not to turn it into an end to end contest. 

Would also love overlapping fullbacks getting more crosses into the box for Haaland too. Grealish and mahrez get isolated out there often.",That’s not even on the players. Absolute farce by the officials to give them that goal. Then there was no coming back from it. Joke.,"I love how we won this. A very scruffy performance. Nothing special. Very few chances created, a lot less possession than we normally have… This is perfect. It shows that you don’t need to be perfect to beat Arsenal this season.",Credit to Saints,u are a bold one,"I just don't see how we are getting past Arsenal with this discipline. Our wing-backs can't cross so it takes away a level of attacking threat. I guess we are also seeing why Laporte and Dias are the best CB duos. 

&#x200B;

KDB is my favorite player, but he definitely was not the best player on the City side today.",Can we pause and be thankful we didn’t go and win the bidding war for cucurella imagine paying 70+ to watch him get beat by a light breeze,"Is there a possibility that some of Manchester Cities general creativity is gone when Haaland and De bruyne is on the field?
Today there was such fluidity in their game. Surely it must be harder for opponents when they have no idea when or where City will explode. Compared to Erling and Kevin which is looking kinda one dimensional lately. Im Norwegian i hope Haaland breaks every single record and wins quad with City this year, but i think they need to sort some stuff out, hopefully with time.",Always great to beat those fuckin cunts 🔥,"The match was crying for Jack, Gomez and Alvarez.",How do you not exploit Milner at RB?,"With Cancelo and Walker out for the next game, surely Lewis is in for his first premier league start?

Or will the suspension be served in the Cup game. Don't know the rules these days.",I didnt watch the game. Did Raheem get boo'd or did our fans behave?,Feel like we’ve got away with one there.

Mahrez had a tough game again. KDB was nowhere until his goal. Amazing how we can sleepwalk and still beat 90% of the teams in the world","I’d like to see more of Alvarez and Phillips. Some players are off the boil, they need to wait out now for their chance to come back in. Stones had a great game, even without the goal","they'll wait for a big game to- 

Nevermind we play Liverpool next Sunday, expect it to drop thu/fri","feels bad for grealish man, put on a great performance but didnt get the goal",3-5-2 might be it to unlock halland. also Bernardo was unplayable today . He did what mahrez didn't do for last 55 MINS,I see United beating Arsenal we’ll be fine boys,"That was a beautiful display today, absolutely flying against Wolverhampton. But damn Grealish took a hell of a kick to the chest, Collins went full karate kick on him",This feels like a dream!,Dare I say... Haaland's movement in the box might even be a level above Aguero's. Take every single one of Erling's attributes except for his footballing brain and it almost seems like he'd still score 15-20 a season for us. He's mental!,KDB+Haaland starting to look nasty,
49,"What the fuck is going on? What is the point of buying Haaland and not giving him a SINGLE FUCKING BALL. Run after run after run after run. WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING HIM? If u wanted a playmaker 9, why didnt u just put €150m on Kane? U can see in the games that Haaland is starting to lose it, he loooooks soooo frustrated never getting passes behind.

And where is Phil Foden? Nothing happened second half and still he doesnt even get to come off the bench in 90 min? WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON???????? Unacceptable.

This team is not strong enough defensively to hold a 1-0 lead, how does Pep not see this. It seems VERY obvious. This is so fucking annoying and still just doing the same over and over. Like it was obvious that Leipzig was coming into this game second half and stuff was happening. Same as last game. Its like they arent even trying to get more goals unless its like big mistakes by the other teams. And it fucks us in the ass, game after game after game.

SO FRUSTRATING.",100 clean sheets for Eddie 💪,"Game changed when we went go 4 3 3

Players were just happy to slowly pass the ball around and let the opposition flood back to defend","As I said in the match thread. You can be mad but you might as well not.

As soon as that goal stood, it didn’t matter what happened. 

If this isn’t an indictment on VAR, and doesn’t lead to change, I don’t think it can be saved in the PL.","Gritty performance. We can’t always be the high flying, pacy squad. I’m ok with slowing the game down and controlling the match especially when we are not at our best.",Feel like we’re regressing this season,And all that after having his jaw dislocated 10 minutes into the match,manchester city keep a clean-sheet challenge (impossible),Rico Lewis already a game changer at his age!

And I know that makes me sound like a massive hater but if Koulibaly jumps and Mendy stops parrying every ball that comes at him over 3 miles an hour then he has done *literally* nothing. It's beginning to be a big problem",Let’s hope Notts Forrest pull out another shocker tomorrow,"Great win. Shame about the goals conceded. First was class by Antony but the others were just us dropping our intensity. That said I don’t mind that as it’s such a long season. When you’re up against the lesser teams it’s good to drop the intensity.

Hope Walker and Rodri are ok and back soon.",Rico runner up,got the job done. we move on,"Basically all game with a man down without conceding, controlled the game even though we didn’t score and basically secure our position out or the group stages.

Philips has excellent long passing.","Selling Gündo would be quite stupid.

He's important and a great midfielder who loves the club",
50,"How the FUCK does Pep look at 90 minutes of that game and say to himself “yeah, no need to change anything, the lot are doing great!”?! You have Foden and fucking Julian Alvarez on the bench, USE THEM. What the hell is going on in that dressing room? Ederson with a howler yet again. Mahrez outside of that goal contributed NOTHING. I genuinely don’t remember seeing a SINGLE forward pass from Bernardo? You have the best fucking forward in the world, at least TRY and find him! Fuck man.. This is getting really frustrating, all that potential and all of it for nothing..","Love to see the fight from the lads. Need to be up for it every time we step foot on the pitch today. 

We’re not at our best. We’re sloppy and we got lucky. But at least we have some fire in our belly still.","We really can play with 36% possession! Huh I’m here thinking we can’t play that way. Pep really thought this match through lol, his baldness has awoken a tactical masterclass","It was a good game, finally taking our chances well. Was nice to see Perrone's debut, he seemed quite good.

He is soo good at staying onside!!","Today, the best step Jack has done is all the time when he gets the ball or moves inside, he attacks the back line. Always his intention is [to] pass and we spoke many times, ‘No, no, the first intention is to score a goal’...""

City fans say he is doing what Pep is telling him to do and don't judge him by goals and assists but Pep wants goals and assists, so what is it? 

Pep holding him back or him being limited when it comes to making assists and scoring goals!?","KDB, my Fkn hero","Wow incredible win

We beat man utd with our b choice defence and 3rd choice cdm.

Don’t know how long, hopefully in ten years :)","Grealish needs to pick up match fitness which is why he was taken off but additionally he needs to be more direct. If he opens himself to score, his passing will be better.

KdBs shooting boots were off but his determination was there and Spurs will feel it.

Alvarez needs to be played and Bernardo should be in the middle. We are more solid in the middle when he is there and with Alvarez' pace and finishing, he will pull defenders away on that right.

Very good performance. I'll rather see Akanji and Diaz next game than anyone else. The team against spurs picks itself.

51,"The players didn't even look like they wanted to win in that 2nd half, there was nothing. Chance creation non-existent, press was uneffective, poor decision-making and an unorganized defence.

However, there's a part of me that's like ffs are we ever going to keep a clean sheet away from home again?","Scoring is more a matter of putting the right people (Foden was fantastic today!) on the pitch. And then just be relentless.

Alvarez did what he was supposed to do, but he wasn’t great. Not bad, not great. 

Aké’s offensive contributions were more than decent as well. Props to him. 

Defensive … idk what’s going on, but City need to sort out their defense. It’s not good. We struggle and we had a few moments where we were lucky today. 

Phillips needs more game time, sure, but he looks so shaky. I have little confidence in him. He also lacks that tenacity you’d expect from a DM. Wish he would take notes from Bernie. Even when he’s not great he’s running around like a mad bulldog with a chip on his shoulder. 

Lewis, while not great today, seems way more confident than Kalvin. Honestly wish City could have convinced Lavia to stay. They could have really used him this season.",Soulless performance,"I'd be embarassed, ashamed, and honestly disappointed if the club and pep dont make a huge deal of the no offside call. 

I never want to see that wanker reffing our game ever again.

The league wants to see a new champion, and that's clear. They also want new contenders. You can't explain that call. Any person with functioning eyes can say it was office, let alone a referee.

Grealish and Mahrez just make us too lethargic and predictable. Mahrez since the summer hasn't had that little bit of explosive pace to get by defenders. They are good at retaining the ball but they don't offer much else. Grealish at least track backs and puts in a tackle.

I was happy to see rw cancelo even though it didn't work. Kdb was poor for bits of the game. Bernardo was great. But city/pep proved me wrong today.

-mahrez clutch goal proved me wrong that's he's not clutch 

-Grealish proved me wrong, he deserves to start 

-pep got it right second half. 

Ake stones Lewis all very good today. 

Walker was poor so way foden though so hopefully they get sharper soon. COME ON CITY we close the gap and move.","Just watching the match now... What was with the Joy Division ""Unknown Pleasures"" giant flag that was in the crowd at the start ? As a ex-Mancunian I'm intrigued....",Glad we get to finally beat the Scousers. Nunez missing his chances remains funny as ever,"Well that's disappointing, but can't have many complaints. Brentford deserved it overall. 

It's bad we couldn't make one good chance from open play in 90 minutes.

I'm not blaming anybody but that Laporte injury really killed us. We started the 2nd half with energy and drive but momentum was killed after the long pause and we couldn't get it back.

Before people lose their shit about being 5 points behind Arsenal, I remember not long ago being 7 points behind a much better side than Arsenal (Liverpool) and we came back to win that Premier League. 

Sucks this is how we break for the world cup but not the end of the world.","Hear me out. The shirt pull was a foul, but how does the ref go back with VAR to call that while ignoring murder scenes before his eyes all game. These inconsistencies are just insane.","That pereira on Rodri’s Achilles is a red.  All day. 

Cancelo a was also a definite red as well.",That'll do,I feel like Grealish would be more effective centrally,"I don't understand people who call for Alvarez to start over Grealish and constantly proclaim he's 100% part of our best front 3. Grealish has had one genuinely poor game but mostly been pretty fucking good to excellent (people are only noticing it in this game because he's doing things you want him to do) all the while Alvarez looks hurried and at times a bit too raw in our system.

I'm not saying Alvarez is a bad player; one day he is going to be a star for us. But people saying he needs to start over Grealish are clueless.

Anyway, excellent win but frustrating that the players all but seemed to give up at the end. I honestly believe if Anthony hadn't scored that goal this game would have ended 4-0. That one goal kicked up the intensity by a bit.",I hope this isn't a r/wooosh on me but just in case it's Wonderwall by Oasis,"Emre Can did his best to set up this game for us only to waste by Mahrez

The difference is Cancelo is more than solid in defense.  TAA has always been a liability defensively, but usually their system can cover him up.

(EPL only. I don't watch enough continental football to comment beyond the UCL.)",Grabara honestly playing like he wants to be 2nd choice to Szczęsny at the WC.,Mahrez is just waiting for the Champions League to start lol,"Really disappointing that.

Exactly what I feared would happen, they've got good players and only need one chance to do some damage.

Missed opportunity to gain distance over Liverpool, yeah gutted to not win that.","Very bizarre game. 

We genuinely weren't all that good, and truth be told, getting dominated by 10 men was extremely infuriating even though we were 2-0 up. 

A rare KdB game where he was poor yet got 2 good assists. Usually when he doesn't play well, then his input goes down as well. Even Foden and Bernardo weren't that great, but they still weren't as infuriating as KdB was at times.

I though Dias was extremely poor, and Akanji did really well coming across and covering for him in a couple of instances. Funnily enough, it was one of those good all-round Cancelo performances, especially defensively, so that was good to see.

Grealish was good. Hopefully he can stay more consistent instead of a 1 in 8 games guy by being functional AND impactful all the same. Because he's hardly been doing the second part much, truth be told and had been leaning exclusively on the first.

Either way though, a great 3-0 win, and if our complete performance comes against Ten Months' swamp dwellers, then all the more better, I'd say.",Well that was pleasant,"Foden MotM

Haaland just absurdly clinical

Liked what I saw from the subs in their limited time (mainly, Palmer, Alvarez, and Phillips)

Overall solid performance but this team just looks like its going through the motions sometimes. Not that crazy considering this condensed schedule but Pep has to manage this better, it's why we drew against Villa.

EDIT: drew against Villa, not lost","After Sané, Ferran 
Now Julian Alvarez is my favorite player. Such a beast in pressing. 
Fantastic through passes by two masters.",
55,"There were quite a few times when we could have had a fast break, but multiple players decided to turn back or pass back or dribble into a congested area with 2-3 opponents and lose the ball or generally not get a pass away quickly enough. And this was AFTER they tied it up & ideally we wanted another goal.  


And before they equalized, just like in the Forest match, you could feel their goal coming ...   


And poor Haaland - nevermind not getting service, he will also get blasted in the media again. I know he is super zen & and admits the stuff he knows he needs to work on, but surely he continues to be frustrated as [he shared in his interview w Alan Shearer just last week](https://youtu.be/jxecAYsmlJ8?t=97).","I understand that I'll get crucified for making this comment but I really think it's time KDB takes a ride on the bench for a good 3 matches or so.

He's either tired as fuck, is getting in his own head, or is starting to decline and I find the third option to be the least likely. Something's wrong with him at the moment.","Glad for the win but after what happened in the first half with Ederson getting booked for time-wasting in a game we wanted to win more than Arsenal did just goes to show the inconsistencies the referees in thes league commit. Even if he was taking slightly longer than usual, how many time does that happen to us at the Etihad when visiting sides nab an early goal then spend the rest of the game shithousing? - yet nothing usually happens until the 80th minute when they finally get a card they should have got an hour ago. 

So even if Ederson was 'time-wasting', its a rarity in a city shirt him doing so. Not that that should prevent him getting one, I'm saying that it never happens on a consistent level. Which is incredibly annoying. The same with the conceded penalty; Which yes was a foul, but Haaland gets penalized against villa for a 50-50 with Martinez and lo and behold we are the assailants again?

Second half thankfully was a great response as Arsenal were beginning to control all areas of the pitch. Thank God pep is a dressing room genius. We came back into the match very well. Experience shone through for us big time. There was quite a few nervy passes from Arsenal which made our life easier in key moments for sure and we looked menacing when we regained control of the midfield. 

Glad for the boys it really seems like we've clicked back into a higher gear and yet I still reckon we can improve further but this moment is massive. Enjoy it blues!",That was a much needed victory. It's been a while since we had a game where we basically sealed the 3 points in the first half. Not much to complain about expect not getting another clean sheet. Haaland is getting closer to that PL record.,Bruh,"The team has a whole was tragic today, Bernardo Silva doubly so.

He got the ball on the right wing once in the second half. It was so sad. Zero speed and the defender was never worried about being dribbled past.

Silva did a few body feints and kicked an underhit back pass to Rico. He's so cooked.",Is it true that the goal decision didn't go to VAR?,"Play ugly and win against the top team in the league, what’s not to like?!","This is one of the worst performances I’ve ever seen us turn in. Abysmal from back to front. 0 shots on target is so sad, and even when we brought in the first team we couldn’t create.

City just made it hard for themselves in the latter 2.

I have been screaming from City to play like this were players are not dwelling on the ball and the difference is huge.

What I took away from this game is what I have suspected all along and that is the ball hoggers make city so much worse.

It was telling that Mahrez, Silva were not in the starting lineup and that Rodri as well as Grealish were starved of service.

What we witnessed was a faster and more potent City side.

I know some would contest that it was only Bournemouth but it was only Forest and Leipzig are not exactly European giants.

This time around they made possession count by movements and passes unlike against the teams that I have mentioned and even Spurs who have been outplayed in the first half of every game I have seen them play bar this City side.

I never want to see Mahrez, Grealish, Rodri and Silva in the same lineup as they waste too much time on the ball.

Alvarez was once again excellent and it is madness that he is on the bench while those I mentioned keep starting.

He tracks back and all. Completely baffled by those that say he has played lots of games that is why Pep is not using him.

Geez just accept that Pep was wrong. The guy is only 23 and he is not hod carrying, he is playing football. Why would he be exhausted. Oh yeah he just won the world cup. He should be flying.

No subs vs RB when required and today there was 5. I agree with Perrone, Gomez and Phillips(he was shite) cos they need minutes but what was the point of Mahrez and Walker?

Bournemouth got more dangerous when Walker came on and I do not even know where Lewis was then deployed to play.

Gomez who was bought to cover at left back was nowhere near there.

This might seem petty after all City won by 4 goals to 1 but all these deployments of players in weird positions is the number 1 reason that City are second and not first in the league.

Second reason is the weird usage of subs in games.

Palace away is going to be tough and apart from KDB for Grealish I'd play with this midfield and attack.",He is improving going forward! I was pleasantly surprised with some of the positions he was in.,Haaland is going to want to leave if we keep completely ignoring him. Spent 90 minutes just running about.,"I am not mad that we lost.

Pragmatism. Genuinely one of the most dreadful city performances I’ve witnessed. The good thing was pep made changes at half time and they clearly worked as we wrestled seemingly full control of the match. What’s bad is we looked like we wouldn’t score for another 500 minutes. And haven’t been convincing in that department in multiple games now. I liked the aggressiveness of the half time changes but why not make a second round of subs at 65 or even earlier. Mahrez had nothing to provide in this match which was evident long before missing the penalty. He looked woeful after as well. I can’t help but think we sometimes could benefit from a lack of control. Dortmund looked open multiple times but the pass was wrong every time.

- Haaland just glides. His pace, movement, size and attitude are all such a rare combination. 

- re: subbing on a hattrick, I think we’ll see Pep look out for Haaland’s health a lot this season. Not to be reactionary BUT: If the staff can give him some world class strength/conditioning and the admins really take care of his workload alongside Pep’s ability to develop; he could be the best in the world for a long time. 

- I think Pep’s biggest struggle will be keeping our attacking depth happy with their playtime and involvement. We will need every bit of depth we have with the World Cup season. The prem trophy and the champions league will likely come down to how this challenge is managed. Pep’s philosophy towards letting any unhappy player leave is one of his best qualities as a manager, but I hope he can keep Mahrez, Bernardo etc etc happy.",

Ofc City didn't score but they dominated the second half, the half time subs and formation change worked very well in that aspect.",That was whelming.,Been brilliant all season though,"I'd love to know how pep intends to unlock grealish. There's a player in there. But he seems either hampered by people in his half spaces or lacking confidence.. or playing in a position/role that isn't suited to his game. 

Maybe he would fair better in the mid, maybe Bernardo winger will allow that. I dunno, but something has to give.",Does Haaland need to go?,Cartoon supervillain 😭,I really think palace was a catalyst for pep to have a new formation to take into consideration,can anybody tell me why the guy who scored two brilliant goals and was arguably the best player on the pitch benched for the whole game while foden was shit for 90 mins and mahrez who’s been mediocre to start the season subbed on lmao ?? also we need to have a conversation about walker he needs some time to get his head on straight.,"Probably not going to be a popular comment, but Foden is not playing well overall imho (despite his goal). Always passing backwards and never trying to beat his man. The 2 times he played a forward pass all game resulted in goals. He needs to do this much more often. Especially when teams sit back, we need a quicker tempo and not recycling the balls from the wing 100% of the time. I think it's time to give Alvarez a start.",Our patent 6-0 victories,1 shot on target.. thought gane for ederson,"If he remains fit, he is breaking Salah's record.",
60,"Teams have figured us out, they can give up 1 goal then wait for us to pass around ourselves into tiredness, and then get a goal or even two.

Still not at our best.,Lmao did anyone see this? Odegaard just followed Haaland to the tunnel calling his name trying to say what’s up and got left hanging,Hopefully that helped identify who’s been letting us down recently…,KDB needs rest mate,I simply do not understand how Haaland can make like 10 great runs a game and we simply refuse to play a through ball of any kind or play direct at all. Also it’s very pathetic to watch us get near the opposition’s box then get pushed all the way back to our own net consistently throughout the match.,"Really felt like the game changed as a result of the horrible decision by the ref. 

But in all honesty, we were horrendous until grealish came on, and we were sloppy defending the counter. Can't wait for dias to come back to lead.",We were the better team tonight. Deserved win.,"This is the match we need Rodri and Bernardo Silva; the CDM, CB play from Rodri and CM, CDM play from Silva is what we missed today. The team that likes to boss the mid field normally had no midfield today for half the match.

There are only 2 ways City manages to mess the system they are so so good at, that is either by changing the core of the team or by messing up the formation.","That was a tough watch

VAR has ruined my celebration, 2 goals disallowed for offside, I waited for both of them to be disallowed and they were. I miss the old days of ball hits the net, flag is down, celebrate!! Just feel like the amount of disallowed goals for micro infringements really reduces enjoyment of a goal. Yes they were both offside but it spoils the moment.

That said fantastic win from a game that was getting away from us. 

Silva and DeBruyne dragged us to the finish line. Legends.","Brighton are amazing, selling their best players and seemingly improving.",Nice to see them disembark the bus after conceding. Desperate.,Gave two easy ones to the noisy neighbors to avoid getting six-oned again. Happy with the two hattricks.

Wouldn't mind if Gomez starts playing in the middle instead",That was certainly a game of football,"Tldw: City have goal rightfully disallowed; Mahrez misses pen; Gomez rightfully sent off; the game plays out 0-0

Stray observations: weird watching us look shit with ten. Felt like we started the game expecting an easy win and never got out of that mindset. Move on to Anfield",We already are. behind arsenal who have a game in hand.,"I said it in the match thread, but Mahrez and Grealish are the 2022 version of 2020 gundo and Rodri double pivot. It just doesn’t work. They have their place in our set up and squad, but not together. A front three of foden/Haaland/Alvarez or Silva is a must. Sadly for Grealish he just never will be them and has to ride the bench like Phillips and Mahrez. Side note, I really like Stones as the “RB”. He’s so good on the ball and really gives us good options with forward balls.",he talked about his weight in the post-match. thought that was interesting.,His long shots were incredible. I remembered that he was a great free-kick taker for Anderlecht last year with this performance. We should've had to pay more for him😅,Comeback FC,"So many reactionary, disgusting takes on Twitter.

Last day of the season. City are 37-0-0 in the league under gaffer Vincent Kompany with 268 goals scored and 0 conceded. Spurs are bottom of the table on 0 points after putting Harold Kane in charge. But City play away to Spurs in London. The final scoreline is 1-0 Spurs, with goal from, you guessed it, player manager himself Harry Kane. VAR can’t confirm that he actually touched it but he swears on his granddaughters life. xG for the match is 0.00 - 11.38.",That offside goal was a killer. No way that should’ve stood.,always happy with a win 💙,"Pep fucked around again with tactics and got burned in first half. Tried to save it in second half, but too late.

As we know smartest thing to do against worst premier league team is to play most complex set up with players with fewest minutes together. Yes Kyle Walker has to play centerback. Yes we need two full backs in the middle forming 3-3 combination to dominate possession in our own half. It doesnt matter we literally cant play out of back as long we have possession in our own half. Not a suprise that players looked like stupid out there.

No need to worry though cause Pep will try again and again his inverted full backs.",Will never understand how we didnt get a pen before half. I get Grealish mightve gone down easy but a kick to the back of the leg is still a kick to the back of the leg.. always a foul.. shouldve been a pen,What an odd game.

Formation was spot on 

Had Mahrez scored the penalty it would have been a different game 

Bernardo added some spark 

Pretty much average game for Man City standards","Of all the games we’ve ever played, that was certainly one of them. I feel like once Gomez went off we went into “don’t lose this game” mode and stayed in 2nd gear. Still, we didn’t lose or concede, so I’m okay with it.",It's amazing that you named 4 of the best midfielders ever and all of them played under Pep,"Alvarez plays with so much passion. Even after losing the ball, he will die to retrieve it.",Giving him more time is the only way to get back to form. Anyone who's ever played a sport can tell you that. And game speed is different than practice. There is no substitute for it.,"As much as it would suck for him, Phillips not being fit for the WC would be best for the season, especially considering our entire midfield will be there","I’m going to put it there, but we need to make room for a statue for Gündogan. What an assist!!! And the way he’s been playing for our club, he deserves to be standing next to Spanish Dave, Sergio and Kompany. 

Bernie is my man of the match. I know the Haaland Hattrick will put a shadow over his performance, but man he was good. 

That said, I sincerely hope we aren’t going to approach every game now as if we are playing QPR or Aston Villa. Fuck me.","Crystal Palace Newcastle and Villa , they all have same patterns , that's Walker underperforming. Honestly I don't blame him . clearly he is being instructed to play in midfield.

Earl’s not half bad either.,"I dont understand why do you guys rate Palmer, he always froze on the left, he is so much better on CAM",Haaland x kdb worked LETS GOOOOO,
62,"I'm not a City fan, but I was curious to hear some City fans opinions on something.

In a game like this, where Haaland was struggling to get involved due to lack of service, would it be worth playing Alvarez instead, at least for a half? KDB and Foden seem to be the only ones able to link up with Haaland, and given that neither of them are consistently playing 90 mins rn, would it be worth playing a profile like Alvarez?

As a big fan of Pep's work (barca fan), it's genuinely shocked me at the amount of blind ""cross it at Haaland and pray"" tactics there has been. I get that that's kind of the nature of playing with a focal point, but are we really getting the best out of the entire team with these tactics? Even when Haaland was banging in so many goals earlier this season, it feels like City have had much less control over games than last year","KDB playing like he’s in FIFA be a pro. Needs to play the easier ball a little more. 

Gundo really should have finished that goal in the opening minute. Haaland should have finished his header later. 2-0 win and I’ll take it, but things just still don’t feel quite right.","Arsenal were the better team in the first half but it’s so satisfying and rare for us to win like this. Capitalise on mistakes, remain compact and time waste lmao. 

So often we’ve lost games when dominating possession, missed good chances and been on the wrong end of so much time wasting. Love it!!","Thats why Pep should keep Mahrez on the fucking bench.

Its not a familiar position with Foden but he still make our team plays much better than Mahrez. Foden offers so much fluidity, energy and creativity for the team, unlike Mr. Backward passing",Effort like that doesn't go unnoticed under this manager. It pays dividends long-term.,"A large portion of our fanbase are being emotionally blackmailed into thinking they cannot say bad things about Pep or he may leave.

This is a Pep flaw. Today was his fault. Winning trophies in the past does not make a manager immune from criticism.",Ref was shit but it’s inexplicable to not get the ball to Haaland,"Barring any injuries, the team arsenal starts against city will be Ramsdale White Saliba Gabriel Zinny Partey Xhaka Saka Odegaard Martinelli Nketiah",Hopefully this stops the “Replace Ederson”,"He will. We take for granted how good he is and often forget he's 22. I remember 22, I was an idiot. He'll get through it and grow into himself.",God fucking damnit. How does this happen. Why the fuck does Pep wait till the very end to make subs that should happen at 60 or 70 minutes. Not even gonna mention the shit refereeing and time wasting,Pep rest players in facup game,Big justice there. He would have been their best defender and they were crying about potentially spending £50m on him when they went and spent £63m on Cucu. hahaha,Kev doesn't look that happy. I wonder why,Can’t believe we have like 46 days now without a game and that’s what we have to remember until then,"Bernardo Silva, what a player.

Defending is clearly not his strength but hopefully something he can improve upon. You can tell he’s excited to be here and giving it all.,"Mahrez needs to go…I’ve finally truly lost hope in him.

Just a goal machine. Alvarez had a good game too and glad he got his first PL goals. Exciting things are happening this season.,Every player did great,www,
63,"This team needs Foden, was obvious after the forest game where we created alot. Pep too obsessed with doing everything in slow motion for ""Control"" when in reality Haaland needs some pace and aggression around him to pull markers off him. And since we sold Sterling and Jesus, Foden is the only winger that can do it. 

Grealish and Mahrez paring simply does not work consistently enough regardless of how well or not they perform individually.","![gif](giphy|l0IypeKl9NJhPFMrK)

Clean sheet baby! Haaland almost killed a guy, Foden is back, Bernardo with the super sub. Fantastic Saturday","All the positive stuff first: it absolutely looks like we're looking for Haaland more now. But also people do need to prepare themselves for more turnovers/counters in games where we look for him, because we can't find *every* single run he makes. We've been very vulnerable to turnovers and counters this season so make of that what you will.  
KDB still has the difference-maker gene even when, truthfully, he's not having a good game. Absolutely turned up when it mattered for the big game here with those little moments, as he tends to do.  
Dias truly is the difference in defense. We were shaky at times yes, but any other of our CBs in place of him and we'd be looking at a draw, most likely. Has to be 1st choice for the rest of the season unless his form drops off a cliff, surely!  
Didn't care about Jack's goal as much as I did his ball retention. People continue to overlook it, but genuinely I think Grealish keeps hold of the ball better than prime Bernardo lol. How can you shit-talk a player with that kind of quality?  

Scarily, Haaland almost looks like he's evolving, or at the very least getting more used to our system. When he first arrived I genuinely did not think he was good at being a ""target man"" striker but does anyone else think he's really starting to add that dimension to his game lately? I do, for sure.

Some negatives:

Call me reactionary but I am truly getting weary of Ederson in goal. I do think I have reached the point where, if rumor came out we're looking to dip into the market for a new GK, I wouldn't be upset. It's not a ""he HAS to go"" situation but like... he makes me tired. Gives me zero confidence at all.  
Bernardo at LB against top teams is looking a bit shaky. It sucks because I like it as a tactic but I don't think we can use it long-term in big games. Maybe should look to get a player with a better profile for that role in the summer? A technical stamina bastard who can cover the whole pitch but still wants to get back and defend.  
We still don't look fit and firing, honestly. This was a game where we had to grit our teeth, imo, but it's not one that makes me think we're dead-on to win the league. If a better striker was playing there for Arsenal, we might not have even gotten any points if we're all being honest. Tomiyasu also gifted a lot to us.

Great game. We're looking at a shitload of away games in the next month's period now, thankfully Newcastle isn't one of them; they're gonna be our next big challenge but at least it'll be at home!",team is so much faster with Foden instead of having to watch Grealish slow everything the fuck down,"He's shown his class for Leeds and England, it's first season syndrome pure and simple. Just need to be patient, especially since he's behind one of the best defensive mids in the world in the pecking order.","Idk what it's gonna take for this team to start playing some balls into Haaland, I can't imagine how fucked off the guy must be going game after game making runs and being totally ignored.","When will refs be held accountable? Will the FA ever own up to their broken system and fix the problem? The biggest robbery of 3 points I’ve ever seen, this game will absolutely make a difference in how the rest of the season plays out and it’s disgusting that nothing can be done to amend the biased refereeing that’s just potentially cost us the title","I miss the days when we were complaining about not finishing chances. Much better than watching all the dilly dallying in possession for 70 minutes. 

Ake MotM for the goal and making me forget Saka was even playing. Losing Stones is going to hurt, but should be nice to get the Dias-Laporte partnership back.",I’m glad we lost this. Champions League and Premier League need our full attention.,"Not giving a yellow for the tackle on Adama, then giving Rodri a yellow for barely pulling a shirt for a second in the middle of the pitch. Then giving a softer penalty then the clear pen before.",If this is how we play we aren't winning the league,"kdb had 2 stinkers in a row but once he finds his form, he will become one of the players of all time again.",Playing him as a wide fullback rather than shoehorned into the inverted RB/CM role (like we’ve done for the past five seasons) worked wonders. Who would’ve thought?,Rico is special,"Need a fullback in January, what we have is not enough. Whats the point of buying gomez if were not gonna use him. Also why isnt dias playing anymore, the only true leader in our team.","People keep blaming the defense but our midfield cost us this game. Terrible turnovers, passing, and deliveries. Didn’t create a Whif of a chance nearly all second half simply not good enough against a top team. Pep not making any subs drives me up a wall too very frustrating. Early in the season still so not too damaging but hope to improve soon",Glad could disappoint 19 other teams today,"If we want Grealish to excel more, we need Cancelo to overlap on the left hand side more often.","Good to see agent Iheanacho working for us again

Which is insane considering how unbelievable Haaland, Foden and De Bruyne were.",inverting full backs is not a bad idea but you need the personnel to do it. Ours was chilling on the bench ( cancelo) for most of the game.,Our form is worrying. Third goalless match in 4 games.,"Of all the games, that was certainly one of them","We were quick to say Akanji was world class , no doubts he had great game in the start but going forward he is a risk at times.  I'm not so comfortable with him compared to our other CBs

I hope Stony is back to full fitness soon","Our best XI is so good they can start against almost any club on the planet down a goal, with just 30 minutes and you would still expect them to win. 

Maybe Pep knows this, and he stuck with what sucked because he was sending a message tonight to Mahrez/Jack. You think you deserve to start? Lol. Uhuh. 

Cancelo and Haaland were really good even when things were bad. Worth a shout

Speculative balls over the top if our defense is too shaky to handle that then replace it. There needs to be some serious shake ups in the summer because this team isn't performing and its not just because of haaland as people love to suggest.,The commentators were a joke,"Can’t believe how negative some of the comments are.

A really effective sub could be bringing on Ilkay and moving Grealish up to the wing. Or, if Alvarez or Mahrez were playing exceptionally well, Grealish can sub off. 

On the flip side, I’d love to see Alvarez get time playing inside and not forced to completely develop a new style extremely wide.",

Right switch for Bernardo to come on, needed more energy on the pitch. 

Nice to see Foden back on top form. Thought the defence was really good today too. Grealish and Haaland wasting time was hilarious.","Haaland only getting a 7 is harsh.

im just sayin","Alvarez is a great player, but as a sole number 9 hes's not the one.","What's with this no intent of passing or pinging ball to Haaland. Who cares if you lose some possession. I don't care if it makes Pep happy, enough with sideways bullshit and how about some through passes by anyone other than debruyne. Everyone is so afraid of losing possession instead of dribbling or out maneuvering an opponent by skills we go sideways.

Broke up Chelsea’s rhythm, able to complete passes under pressure, executed an impressively accurate switch to Mahrez on the right touchline, not responsible for any major errors.

It really felt like we were just lacking the final pass today.

Look at the three first  goals.  

1. Foden pulls one defender witty him, Haaland pulls three going for the cross and suddenly there's open season for Cancelo.  

2. Haaland starts out in one direction and and all the Hampsters follow him, so suddenly Foden is alone in the box for KDB to serve.  

3. Haaland has one defender top front and two around him, lobbing the ball over him lets Mahrez have the dance floor for himself.  

It's a great way of stopping Haaland, but come on.

Nobody talk!” Pep, right now, maybe.","City are worse with Haaland *when they don't give him the ball*.

Small caveat that makes a big difference","Everton and Frank Lampard is such an embarassing club. Going into to this game with one fucking tought on their mind : DEFEND with 11 man! With some fucking luck they manage to grab 1 point. Wasting time and they look like completely fools.

What also pisses me off is that CITY does not make any subs. We continue go do the same build up play for 86 minutes straight. God damn.

I just want to know . Don't do this to us ever again pep especially not in CL. I have suffered enough 😫,"Absolutely incredible from the lads.

I do want to admit…I was SOOOO WRONG about Haaland. I was being cautious about his arrival and didn’t want to overrract so I initially predicted he’d end the season on 15-20 goals, but now…

Its when the other players ignore him","I get not starting Alvarez, but Mahrez and Grealish can’t play together against low blocks. How de Bruyne played the full 90 is beyond me since it seemed like he lost the ball half the time he got it.

First half was sludgefest. No shots on target and Pep goes 3 at the back. You love to see it. Those changes made all the difference. 

2nd half was a huge shift in energy. Bernie was running at everyone. Julian was everywhere. Gundo was the gel. And our Nordic meat shield found that connection.

Miss the beautiful, fluid and threating football we used to play. Even without a proper striker last season, our game was more enjoyable","This def looked like a throwaway game.

I mentioned salah and saka and some posters claim they do track back and defend🙄 obviously livarpool and arsenal fans in disguise.,"Yeah, what a disappointing end to the year. It's been a very long year, but yeah, what a way to end it.

I don't see how we possibly even get back into contention for the league because Arsenal don't look likely to drop points like we do, the Brentford game was just two games ago and we still haven't learnt from that because these are games we need to win but we just don't and the late subs too, it was just too late at that point.

We may have such a prolific striker to score over 30 and not win the league, which will absolutely suck but I see that more as a possibility game after game.

Games like these happen more and more, we give away the ball sloppily and then that's it, we waste chances and what's worse is that it seems like everyone forgot to shoot and its only Haaland that's a threat.

Anyone who thought Arsenal would drop off or flop at some point because they've never been in this position before are wrong as I called it because Arteta knows what it takes because he was Peps assistant not too long ago.

People said we'd be fine, that we'd go on a winning streak at some point during the season but we can't rely on the luck we had in the past to help us each and every time.  Not good enough by the standards we've set.

Game felt really poorly managed by the ref. Everton were shithousing and wasting time from the start but to be fair to them that's the way it is when you're in relegation scraps. Crazy to think they've spent like half a billion etc and are having to resort to this kind of football but it is what it is, I don't blame Everton I blame the ref, he just handled it really poorly imo.

We also made some mistakes but for large parts were fine I think. Lewis looked great but his defensive positioning is a little lax. Mahrez looked better again, Jack was good, Rodri was good for the most part but a bit passive defensively. Kevin though. So weird he had such a bad WC, then came back and was on absolute fire then drops that stinker, wonder what's up with him.

Tough game, Everton ground out a draw. On to the next, we can still put a big streak together. The first half was great, we were in real control so there were positives.

Edit: Why did I think it was on goal diff? Silly me.","I can't help myself thinking about how Liverpool reacted when Nunez got red card vs Palace. It was as if they woke up, and the pressure they put palace under with one less player was admirable. 
We played so sloppy today, both before and after the red card. This Copenhagen team is number 7 in the Danish leauge(12 teams total)...
I love City and i cant blame the second most winning coach in history, but in CL i feel like this was something ive seen before.
We create nothing, and look totally off - and Pep stubbornly refuses to make a single change. If he does make changes, its late. 
I feel hes like, na this team started and this team should finish it. It's up to you guys. 
I love how we can play football when we are at our best, but i must admit i kinda hate that we play almost identical when we are 0-0, 1-0 or 0-1..

The last thing i worry about is the ""panic"" that sets in the team when there is something important to ""lose"". I know we have had some sick last minute winners and turning 0-2's to wins. But what im talking about is the total change in playstyle when we know that we are 1 conceded goal away from going out of a tournument or something. Alluding to last years CL.. 

Like we have 2 drives, one is the robotic passing mode, the other is the panic mode where we play really shit. 

Lastly i believe the goals scored this season, does not reflect on our preformances. Looking at the table we might look like the best team in the world atm, also how the media have pumped us up. 
But i have seen every single minute of this season, and to be honest our best half so far was 1 half vs united. Not because of 4-0, but because of how we played. 

I have watched 2 european teams that have played better football than us this year, thats Napoli, and Real Madrid. 

So this was kind of a rant i guess, but these are my thoughts - im an emotional fan.",He was but Pawson is Pawful and reffed the game poorly.,"Lets focus on the bad things plz. Jack and mahrez have to change their way of playing asap. Both of them on the pitch at the same time is a nightmare.

We are soooo sooooo soooo slow on switching sides of the pitch man. We need gomez to turn into prime marcelo and start for us consistently. That will help jack alot cuz he is not helping himself.","He wasn't a bit off. He had two center backs on his back, which gave so much space to wingers.

I think that’s kinda the problem. KDB in this lineup would skew us too far away from control, we would be very vulnerable defensively and against a press. In this lineup I think Alvarez is actually replacing KDB but is more advanced when we’re in possession, the advanced midfielder in this system just suits Bernardo and especially Gundogan a lot more. As much as people love Alvarez would you really like seeing KDB dropped often?",On the right* with Grishi on the left,Grealish who barely beat his man was our best player today attacking wise and that show how poor was all the other players and Haaland himself literally has 0 touched inside the box lmao.,"Clearly offside goal, interfering with play.

I'm with the rest of you on the substitute front. I understand some of the bench aren't trustworthy atm but there is still quality rotational depth.

Haaland might be his best game from a non goal scoring point.  He really should be used more his strength to push into space is unmatched.

KDB I dont know how many players make that first shot.  Second his short space burst to explode into a patch is wild.

Ake: No more 3 back.  This man shut down that side of the field.  He is our LB.

Grealish: He got his goal and in a big game :)

Ruben Dias:  Sign him for life.  Dude is a leader and a wall.

Rodri: Best DM in the world.",Great insight. Thanks for the info!,Both other goals were off his hockey assist. He had quit the game.,"The issue in first half and most of 2nd, is that the ball moves forward to slow. Everytime we see   possible run in front, the team stops to look for other players.

Do you know the reason they play it?","I don't want to be overly critical, I personally didn't want him when we signed him, but mahrez needs to go, he has never fully meshed with us, he's too slow for what we need and not effective at what he does.

I get a lot of us will be reactionary about him after this game, but mahrez just isn't it.

No particular standouts as I thought there was a lot of rustiness.

77,I've never seen a team handicap themselves like us this season. It is not that complicated to play to your strengths. Either change up tactics to make use of Haaland or just play Alvarez up top. The world isn't going to end if we're dominant without Haaland if Pep isn't willing to make changes. I'm worried this will just poison the dressing room if things continue on like this because I can't imagine the players being happy with this. There is enormous potential in this squad and it is being wasted without proper excuse.,"Huge result. As important as the win v Arsenal 

Jack, Foden, Dias, and Ake all in great form and its a huge bump having them firing on all cylinders. 

KDB’s spell is starting to become an issue. I dont think you can even start him in big matches playing like this. Odd to me that a rather large cohort here thinks criticizing him is verboten and cant be done. Bernardo and Gundo should be starting in the biggest matches for a bit imo, until KDB has shaken the cob webs off.

We cant afford someone who kills fast breaks before they get going and just hands possession away so haphazardly. If im Pep im benching him for a few matches and trying to sort out whatever is going on there in the background that we dont know. Maybe somethings off in personal life. Idk. 

Ederson’s distribution was piss poor. And its. A concern. Ive defended him through the year, but lets be honest. Take away his on the ball skill and he doesn’t offer enough to be our number 1.

I don't know what he is talking about regarding they had preseason after world cup and they decided to go another way cos he was pleased about the pre season work out.

But from what I can see this has been close to a shit show.

Team selections, use of personnel, marginalising of certain players has watching from afar been bad.

The football is too slow, they leave such big gaps everywhere for teams to exploit in almost every game.

Players like Mahrez, Rodri, Grealish and Silva taking an eternity to release the ball but in the mean time have not gone past their man.

Passing the ball backwards and sideways almost every time in the name of possession.

Today Rodri was horrendous but the sad part is that there is no adequate replacement.

They did this crap in the first game and I said passing the ball or attempting to pass the ball in your box or anywhere in your half if there is a possibility of it being nicked that could lead to danger should never be attempted.

What does Rodri do? He is under pressure and you pass the ball to a kid who is facing his box to extricate himself from the situation you have put him in.

Of course the ball is won and you go down a goal. Amateur hour at its worst.

Our £100m man had his pocket picked by Emerson Royal almost every time.

Some would say oh Grealish was coming back and helping but you do not spend that amount on someone for him to show a good work ethic.

He needs to beat his man, put dangerous crosses in not overhit ones or hopeful ones.

I mean it is Royal for goodness sakes but believe it or not he was 1 of City's better performers.

Silva always seems to have his head down, taking a million touches and running down a cul de sac.

Absolutely useless fodder for Haaland who would prefer for the pass to be played early but Silva does not have it in his locker.

Ake played well defensively but Akanji was shaky 1 of his worst displays since he has been here.

Lewis should not be in this situation as he is too young to be doing what he is being asked.

Who was the left back or was Grealish playing left wing back?

I honestly do not know what City are doing at this point in time.

Arsenal losing yesterday has been rendered meaningless and to be frank with you guys I see City losing more games if they continue with this pointless football and system.

Before I forget what is the point of enzo Maresca and the other guy that is sat next to Pep.

Don't they ask the boss wtf are you doing?",Whats the point of playing haaland if u wont pass him the ball,"Really kept Arsenal at bay well for the most part. They're the genuine article but the way we limited clear-cut goalscoring chances is hopefully something we can replicate in the league. Also, Ake with the right footed finesse finish is not exactly what I would have guessed to be the winner but I will absolutely take it",That was definitely top 5 worst performance in the Pep era. Blaming the kit and keep it moving,Thinking about that Big Mac combo he is going to get after the match…,One of the few times when KDB wasn't in form. Going to justify it as WC blues so I can stay sane,I think it's been made clear that Foden LW will no longer work in this system.

No cutting edge in attack, just going through the motions. Defensive mistakes left and right. Haaland was a shell of himself, getting knocked down or slipping whenever he had a chance. Really could have / should have been 3-0 or worse if not for a golazo from Foden and smart positioning from KDB at the end. Awful way to go into the break.",Pep big brain classic strikes again,This match left me feeling like committing a crime.,We need Jude to deny our rivals from gaining a solid midfielder.,Snoozefest. That was awful,Annoying to concede 3 goals but it is what it is. Great play and goals today. On we go!,Thank you!,"Apparently we topped the group?

Really blown away with him,Cry me a barrel then 😭,I'm a bit worried about Haaland. It seems like he's regressed since joining us. He scored a hat trick on his debut for Dortmund and yet it's taken him until his 4th game in the prem to get a hat trick for City. Really unsure if he'll be able to adjust to the league properly,We made Villa look good. That's how bad we played today🥲,"He's evolving 😈 also remember some people saying "" Haaland doesn't create his own chances he just scores them""... Welp guess they can cross that one out now 😂",HAAALAAANDDDDDDD,Gundogan?,"Great way to start the season. Bit sloppy early in the second half, but otherwise a very solid performance.

They handed the whole game to them. Absolutely disgraceful,"Arsenal fans calling that their 'b team' when Partey, Saka, Xhaka, Zinny, Saliba, Odegaard, Martinelli, and Trossard all played is hilarious.

STONE BANGER!!! 💭

Foden, Alvarez & Silva literally changed the game by putting crosses after crosses or making chances for Halland. 

I really don't know what our 100Million offers on the pitch but he ain't UCL material that's for sure couldn't even take on 1v1 and didn't even made any Chances or crosses to Halland literally. 

Same he did against Seville FC players couldn't even take on any players.

Haaland as a striker.,"Lads didn’t have their best performance. It happens. Really sloppy in the final third, a lot of chances to be had but the final ball was rarely right. Unfortunate to be punished on a chance out of nowhere but honestly it looked like we just turned our brains off for a moment defensively.",That was basically akanji forcing a move by refusing a new contract.

82,"This game was almost identical to the match against Forest the other day. Dominate possession to stat pad while the other team just waits for us to slip up. No creative energy at all besides from grealish and haaland getting 0 service. Also no subs when Foden or Alvarez could have been a huge boost, even Rico Lewis for Walker would have been an improvement. There was clearly no momentum in the second half so I have no idea why Pep wouldn’t want a change.","Good result, poor performance that","Just remembered that spurs fan that predicted arsenal’s results against Everton, Brentford and City. Almost got them all right. Didn’t account for the bent referring against us",That Spurs curse is strong,"Thought he was pretty shit.

The team looks much more comfortable with the 4 at the back.,I'm starting to think the kit is cursed,Cancelo kills any attacking threat down the left because he just wants to hold the ball and do everything himself. I dont think we will be seeing much of him for the rest of the season.,am i tweaking or pep can't see that mahrez and grealish both on the wing does nothing for us....,"Phew it wasn't the most convincing win but all that mattered was winning, and finally getting a clean sheet again.

Those first 45 minutes was I think the worst half from Pep Guardiola in his City career. Got it completely wrong tactically everywhere.

Again, he's not a world-class fullback but he doesn't need to be.",Probably deserved a draw that match. Happy to get the full 3 points.,"Amazing win, annoying to concede that pen in the end. At one point we had 4 ex Dortmund players on the pitch! Would love to see more Alvarez!",Bold of you to assume that UEFA draws are random. There’s always an element of fixing,"This match is an insult to the fans who follow the team to Germany, and the fans who stay up until 4am to watch this.

**Positives :** 

* Ake has not skipped a beat and is back to being in good form ( technically he never dropped his ""good"" form)
* KDB and Haaland got very few chances but made them count.
* Haaland met his match in size and speed but ended up being the better athlete. 
* Stones is getting better and better. 
* Cancelo was the best player on the pitch barring one mistake ( was a big part of the villa equalizer unfortunately)

**Negatives :** 

* Walker was a liability in 1st half ( bad passes and whatnot)
* that right wing position is a fucking shadow realm. We cannot seem to incorporate it into our system that well. would be true for left wing too but Foden is faster than most so it's being covered up. 
* Rodri my man...start counting your blessings. You are NOT fernendinho or casimero yet. You are not as crafty as them in tactical fouls. Altho he is fouling when necessary and not doing a pepe and going full mad man. 
* Ruben on the other hand has to do what I think rodri should do less of. Be nasty plz. 

**Horrifying scenarios we barely escaped :** 

* Ederson was close to getting 8 more stitches on his face and be out for the season. 
* A villa win",thought dias was really good second half,"Was it just me or tactically did it seem more like a 4-4-2 than our usual 4-3-3. Alvarez (who would've been the RW in the 4-3-3) was very central, like a central striker and Bernardo was wide on the right (like a RM in a 4-4-2)",Akanji strikes me as a very intelligent player.,Time to get a Viking hat,

There's acceptance in dropped points if you tried everything tactically, but yet again, pep has helped drop points.

Festive season, 2nd game in 4 days and you don't even add fresh legs to the starting 11? i don't mean youth, but fckn WC winner, foden, cancelo, walker arguably part of our best 11.

NVM that, you're drawing with only 20 to go and you change nothing? triple change with 3 minutes to go, fr?

This is the game where Philips not being ready at all has hurt us, rodri/kdb looked spent. 

Ya'll need to watch highlights from Sane seasons to know what's expected from a city winger playing against buses every single game. Man competed with KDB for assists ffs. Standard with Grealish is so low man has one goal build up contribution and apparently he's good now. This is not his first season. PLUS Ake CB can't complement isolated winger.  

Who cares if haaland gets 100 goals if our entire system is worse now. 

Not expecting arteta to drop 7 points on us, he's experienced in the title challenges with city. Have to hope they have massive injuries + pep somehow changes tactically.",Good win 😎,Its crazy how these transfer sagas seem to always work out for us in the end,Been our best CB this season CMV,"Deserved to lose no urgency at all how many times our players make run in behind a defender completely being ignored by our midfield and defence and they're passing sideway instead, and our players moving the ball so slow like we're 3 nil up we've seen this over and over again surely this has to change after this, and why does our player are so shit at shooting outside from the box? And Pep doesn't want to make used the subs again, and we need a new approach we're way too predictable with our playing style, and lastly referee were bad but still doesn't change the fact our performances was so disgraceful.","Some players had really a stinker, but honestly I think it's mostly on pep.

Luckily it didn't matter in the result, but it was surprising to see a City player not put pressure on a defender (even though it would have taken a big effort to get there!)",He is good attacking but suspect in defense. I think it takes time to know the system. Some of his mistakes are self inflicted though but he needs to work on his nerves. Felt like he got overwhelmed.,"I'm not saying it's entirely his fault, i went to the match in Dortmund and Copenhagen and I don't remember a single thing he did.

- Grealish looked lively in the 2nd half. That run at kickoff was unreal. Haaland also has to finish that header. 

- Let West Ham back into it but Haaland shows what we’ve been missing in more ways than one on his goal. Yes, that finish was clinical and something where Jesus or Sterling would have possibly taken a touch and missed it. But maybe more importantly, I bet you could count on one hand how many true counter attack goals we scored last season. We’ve missed that pace when Sane left and haven’t been able to punish teams on the counter.  Unless De Bruyne was making a super run with the ball, it wasn’t happening. 

- Joao and Rodri were great today. Foden had a moment or two but lack of preseason probably played a part. Kevin still taking a little while but shows you his quality with two amazing passes that should have been goals. 

- Gundogun certainly had his moments and deserves a few bad ones (messed up a counter playing it back to Haaland, missed that beautiful ball from Kevin, gave West Ham their best opportunity of the game on the Rice chance) since he wasn’t fresh for not playing in the preseason. 

- That takes me to my final point in Bernardo. Are we confident that Gundogun was always supposed to start this game? Would surprise me to think they’d start Gundo after Bernardo had started every game in the preseason. And I understand Bernardo came in but it feels to me like the Barcelona links played a part. Bernardo has been amazing for us but it would upset me if he asked to leave this late in the window. The season’s started and there’s no time to find a replacement and get them acclimated. Would not be a great way to end his City career.",

Little did I know we were getting the best fullback in world football,Fucking brilliant. Controlled it just about from start to finish and Haaland did exactly what we've been needing someone to do. So so excited for the season,

Passing it side to side and then backwards does nothing if you see and opening and don't try to assist haaland or julian",Every single time I see that first united goal it becomes more crazy how that was actually given. That's textbook offside interference. I don't believe you can get a clearer example than that. Joke,"Happy with the win. Maybe the boys will have a good mentality when we play them again. With that said… we were not impressive. Arsenal went to another gear after our goal and we were hanging on there for a bit. If Arsenal play at that level with their full first team, we will have to be much much better than today to win that game. Boys just looked tired.","Why is our defence completely different every game? All these different systems and ideas, it's just weird. We're so weird this season. We need some consistency seriously. Why is Walker at CB in a back 2 when we have Akanji and Ake on the bench? It's fucking frustrating. Why can't we just have a straightforward lineup","Foden was hurt. If he was fit im sure hed be put in over palmer. I think we should loan palmer for the rest of the season, i dont rate him yet for first team play","I don’t want to overreact but it doesn’t feel like it’s happening for us this season. I just get the sense a lot of the players in the team just don’t have the same hunger to win the league after having already won it so many times before. Grealish and Mahrez wing pairing again doesn’t work but pep once again has to keep using it and making subs too late, just so frustrating to watch.

It's too easy...","I say this with humility and understanding that he knows the game much more than I can ever hope to, but Pep needs to be less stubborn. We had 100 minutes of play there, by the second half it was clear that the plan was not working well yet we made no changes until the 87 minute. 
We have also seen goals like the one Toney scored against us more times than I can count. 
It’s incredibly frustrating to watch as a fan that sometimes we seem stuck in our ways. When our ways work it’s great and we are the best team in the world. But when they don’t, we seem to have an inability to readjust and I think that is our downfall
However, chin up. I think we can use this as a chance to regroup and come back stronger after the World Cup (barring injuries- fingers crossed)",I feel more justified in saying we needed a RB the entire offseason rather than a LB. Pep took KDB out of the game by playing him where he did. Probably was a foul on the disallowed goal but never would’ve been given if the situation was reversed.,"Just one of them games - one that we'd not have gotten anything out of in years past. Completely comfortable until the red card, and from then on, everything that could've gone against us did.. until the 94th minute.

Not laughing at you, mate, just smiling because it seems so incredible that you genuinely didn’t know about Wonderwall.

I am sure he will turn it around but Grealish is first choice for the foreseeable.",Tough to result to take but it's not over yet lads. 21 matches left in the Prem.

Someone is wearing some rose colored glasses, because half the team deserved a 6 or less. A couple of them MUCH less.","Kev and Cancelo looked like shadows of there former self. Peps tactics in the first half worked to neutralize the Liverpool attack but I'm glad we switched it back in the second half though to go for it.

we deffo need that summer squad shake up though","Can’t wait for the FA to claim whoopsie got this one wrong, we’ll change the POV next time","wanna see KDB benched for a while, play bernardo and alvarez more, laporte was also class. ortega very good bounceback and ake MOTM

still not a convincing win, the performance should have been better against this arsenal team and we should have probably been losing at half time. im not looking forward to the emirates at all.","Simple answer - this was a comp we could afford to forsake this year. Yes we joke and big up the carabao like its automatically ours with the recent history, but let's be honest, our upcoming fixtures take priority.

I think that was reflected in not only the way the player's performed but clearly how pep just wasn't interested throughout the whole game. Some individuals had stinkers yes and that's on them. I'm still remaining optimistic for Saturday.","No, he has a foot problem that he sustained against United last Saturday.",Yuck,something poetic about pep finally using his subs early and them making instant impact innit,🤒🤕🤧,Crazy he’s only 18. The kid is an absolute baller.,"Terrible performance from the team. Every attack was an easy to defend lobbed ball into the box, every shot was into the stands, Brentford wasted as much time as they possibly could, Haaland had someone fucking full on hugging him the entire match with impunity, and Pep decided we looked like shit but it’s fine I’ll just make one sub super late. We would have been lucky to get a draw and definitely did not deserve to win. What a shit way to go into the WC but we were just not at it at all today.",Pep flirting with Salah at the end wtf,"What a team! Even if the scoreline was 2-1, I loved watching this match. I cannot single out only one player who played their best, I’m so happy with how beautiful we played the game even with 10 men.

Still think it was the right call moving on from Raz, he hasn't looked particularly great in that Chelsea side.",Glad he scored the one against Villa and missed this one rather than the other way round,"Experiencing that crowd in the first half was outstanding, but I'm feeling pretty bitter about how we finished. Seen some blaming the disruption caused by the subs but honestly, from where I'm sitting, it just looked like Ederson forgot how to play the ball out. Just put us under unnecessary pressure by failing to get the ball out of dangerous areas and giving away daft throw ins. 

Moaning aside, delighted with the double hat trick, felt Akanji and Grealish were outstanding, and I hope Walker isn't badly hurt.",He looked pretty average outside the great goal. Was pretty inaccurate in passing and crossing,Or Alvarez,[removed],"Palmer always looks lost. He needs a lot more play time imo. Mahrez only plays effectively if we’re facing a team that defends narrow. He’s an outlet without fail but other than that he’s a one trick pony. 

That second half was atrocious. Didn’t even looked like it was city playing the first 20-30 minutes of it",Who cards after the game? What a clown ref,"KDB, Haaland, Cancelo, and... Rodri?

I rate Rodri right up with (the Real Madrid version of) Casemeiro and Veratti, but I'd say they are in the same class.

Edit: How could I forget Scott Carson?","Yeah bad comparison, we had 100+ goals that’s season as well though right?",Never in doubt,"I am so fucking hate this match. The whole team play really really slow since the match started. So fucking slow.
Many chances missed, lose a crazy goal tiny xG once again, our wingers sucks. And Foden was in Ashley Young’s pocket. Its fucking 37 years old Young 😫😫😫",Also his mental math is scary,I enjoyed seeing a mix of experience and younger players coming on from the bench,May not have a choice … but agree he looked good,Haaland is so handsome and good.!!,
91,"I cannot understand Pep. Allowed his team to take their foot off the pedal up 1-0. No urgency to get another goal. Then, when desperate… no subs???  What the hell. You’ve got Foden and Alvarez on the bench. Makes zero sense to me.","hahaha, looks like foden KO'ed the fck out of that guy cold in the octagon",Super Jacky grealish. Good game from the lads and a great pep talk at half (pun intended🤭),Can't determine where pep will want him just yet since when he came on the formation was a free for all.,He was great,"We need dias, laporte, kdb and foden all back in the lineup","We just capitulated. Fouls not being given. Still annoyed that their 1st goal was given tbh. 1st half was shambolic, so many sloppy and disorganised passes going to no one, players make the run and we pass the ball behind them. We have one of the best strikers currently in world football and not once did we play to his strengths. Same as Southampton it’s not the result that angers me (still hate losing and especially to United) but it’s the way we played, gave them lots of chances… frustrating to say the least, but we move on to Tottenham next. As always, we go again!! 

Probably gonna get hated for this but it needs to be said, Walker isn’t that guy anymore, he’s one of the reasons why they got their second goal, he was no where to be seen. I’m tired of him running up the line, he can’t cross the ball to save his life and is constantly out of position (specifically a lot more this season) when they get the ball. I think it’s time we either look for a new established right back or we put all our faith and trust into Lewis.",So when can we have the conversation of Ortega giving Ederson a run for his money and displacing him in the league and CL? Or I wouldnt mind Ederson in the league and Ortega in the CL.,"It seemed blatantly obvious going into this game that if you’re going to start a unpracticed formation like this then you need Rodri anchoring, or Bernardo in midfield alongside Phillips. I will say Foden was good in midfield today, maybe the only positive to take from this one. Made backtracking runs several times that he probably wouldn’t have a year ago. Not gutted to be out of the least important tournament but not thrilled with that performance",He’s injured,"It’s aight, we’ll win the next one",Pep finally made early subs and see it worked pep,Honestly mate he’s 20. He doesn’t look sharp but he hasn’t been playing enough (my opinion). The World Cup break really hurt him.,"Hopefully they stick with him, has all the tools to be our next starting RB.",Arsenal up 5 .  We have 2 games that’s 6 what’s the damn deal,Probably deserved a draw overall but Liverpool scored at the right time and defended well,WOOOOOOOO,Couple twats booed him but overwhelmingly positive reception,sly Pep,"Jack - Erling - Phil front 3 is god tier. 

No disrespect to Mahrez, Alvarez or even Bernado. That 3 should be the default 3 for important games.",The singer (Noel Gallegher) is a blue. All the reasoning I've ever heard tbh,I think Alvarez can score a lot and is explosive. He deserves more minutes,"Tbf, Mahrez criticism is not based on one performance. Its months going back to last season

It’s a simple fact that off the ball and defensively he is our least productive winger. 

If he doesnt have end product, or contribute materially on the ball, he deserves to be questioned. Unlike players like gabby in the past say who brought more to the side than attacking output, or Grealish even who carries the ball forward under pressure and makes contributions apart from G+A. 

I think its dodgy to act like people are being unfair to him. Mahrez has not impressed, has significantly less upside at his age than alternatives like Alvarez or Palmer, and is the worst of the lot in terms of work rate and defensive contribution",rodri passing the ball to the player with more pressure on him every fucking time was getting on my nerves,"Bernardo, Foden and Alvarez literally change the game and Grealish should stay on the bench forever",He needs to recalibrate his game and be a team player. He is too selfish. Haaland always acts frustrated by him. He is really good though. Very intelligent.,Bicenturions,"Nice run by Mahrez on that 1st goal, creating room for Silva","Our specialized right wing option has been absolutely garbage for a few months now, and is aging, which is not good. On top of that he was never a natural at tracking back, so there's that as well.

Also, Walker's showing signs of being finished, which isn't ideal. 

On top of that we have a lack of diversity in terms of wing options...

Yet despite this, unlike the Newcastle game, we should've won today...",Come on you Bees!,"Everyone's talking about the obvious players, but I think Kyle Walker actually had a perfect match.","Was a very interesting game. 

Gomez looked very good. Cancelo looked better at RB. He slots into midfield better than Walker and is also more dangerous.

Akanji looked really good. Great squad depth.

Phillips looked very good especially considering how long he’s been out injured. Will be great to be able to play him as box to box or even as a double pivot with Rodri.

Foden looks better on the right. Grealish adds a lot to the control of our game. Alvarez looks class and presses so well. Palmer looks classy when he comes on. 

Haaland obviously. Say no more. 

I’m really really happy with how the squad is looking tbh.","And we will only get better with each match, geting more match fit and used to playing with an actual striker.",
92,God this team sucks to watch. No creativity,Actual representation both team today lol,MASSIVE THREE POINTS!!!! FINALLY TOP AGAIN 💙,Great news from an england perspective,he was more on the right with foden playing balls in the box otherwise he would just be his regular self dribbling and making a 100 spins b4 passing,Haaland is bigger and faster than anyone in the league but we refuse to put it over the top to him. It’s like we forgot the goal earlier this year where he nodded everyone for a goal that way.,"We have been generally subpar since the world cup, even a few games before it. And using the Chelsea game as evidence against that fact is like comparing who's bed is more smeared with shit...","Would love it if our second XI doesn't become our first XI. Only Ake can stay on from that XI, since he's basically doing the Walker role, but on the left.

In theory, it means that we can get more funky on the right, but understandably, Lewis doesn't have the adventure with his passing that's sometimes required as he passes it backwards too much for my liking. But he'll get there with time. Hopefully whatever's happened with Cancelo can be solved, because he can definitely add something on that right-hand side going forward.

Also, I don't think we can play Gundo and KdB as 8s against top teams as it's simply too lightweight defensively, especially when Gundo's not pushing forward.

Either way though, good win! Hopefully we can get an easy draw for the next round 😅",The boys had gone out with the idea of a leisure game and they were just outrun. Then there is no coming back from two down. I don’t think anyone would feel sorry for that game. And you don’t have to guess which one is more important - this one or Saturday…,Bit harsh after he played 5 minutes!,Big pile of shit that,1 thing i learned is it doesn't really matter who started the game but we need to make the subs earlier because it's usually work well for us.,He's 20. Give him some time. If he weren't good pep wouldn't start him.,Yes he is ready!!! What composure. That tackle on salah was class.,"This is genuinely the kind of performance I hope players get fined for, it's that bad. Every single player bar Ederson looked like they were just saving themselves for the WC, losing every single second ball.

Even Haaland, the only dude not going to the WC looked completely lost and at one point just sat on his fucking ass in the box while the ball was getting crossed into him.

Completely pathetic performance. Right now Arsenal are far and away deserved league leaders. We just haven't looked right in ages and gotten by on moments of brilliance. The task Pep has in getting this team whipped into form and catching up to Arsenal is monumental considering half of them are gonna come back with their whole body broken once the WC is over.","Not gunna lie, past seasons I'd be pretty fucked off with this result against Liverpool but not this time. I feel like Arsenal are the only team in the way and they will drop points.","Didn't watch the game, had BT sport score on though. Pretty great considering we were down to 10!","Cheered as he came on, a few boos during the course of play when he received the ball",I thought this also.,Stupid goals we conceded. It doesn’t matter today but we need to tidy up if we want a deep CL run,Yeah I'd love more of him too. Also think akanji is somewhere on the pecking order for rb,Not hard,"mahrez has been bad to start the season, criticism deserved.","Pep said a couple of weeks ago that Mahrez isn't fit and isn't ""strong"". He was pretty scathing with the way he saying it too. 

He's been dreadful this season so far, hopefully he can find his fitness over the world cup break for him.","What a dogshit performance that we've somehow gotten away with it 😭😭😭

For fuck's sake, we can't keep doing this 😂😂😂",So wise grasshopper,Gloverez is peak mahrez i guess,"THE ""BRUTE"" HATTRICK ERLING ""BRAUT"" HAALANDDDDD","Walker injured, so we have one senior fullback left. Oh no, a problem that we entirely saw coming!",When that ball went in I was sure Haaland would get there and when Jack finished it I legit was howling with joy. The slander recently has been insane.,Liverpool 😂😂🤡,Phillips’ passing range is amazing. Will be a great asset in the future.,Great game lads. I’m wanting more from grealish he needs to sprinkle in some runs in behind,
93,"It's a fine result I'll take it. We are a significantly better team at the Etihad where I'm confident we'll turn up and win.

I said at half time how Leipzig would obviously be a lot better in the second half given how dreadful they were in the first half. Unfortunately our players weren't prepared for it, which kinda sums us up this season.

Anyway I don't feel like dwelling on the negatives because like I said, a draw away from home in the first leg is a decent result we move on.",You oily plastic cunt.,"What's bigger, City or Grealish's calves?","I thought Phillips was generally terrible, especially defensively. Missed a couple tackles, slow to react, low intensity to cover mistakes or runners. Granted, he’s not seen much game time but this performance won’t help get him more minutes.","atleast they do try to find haaland atleast once, alvarez has to leave his position to link up and still not get the recieve pass when in the area","Funny how all reports say Pep wants more control.

3 defenders and 2 man pivot in possession. Small control, no attack, and still leaking goals.

Pep is a legend but he is infuriating.",Plan to stop city: mark KDB at all cost.,"Ortega should be starting over Ederson. Its clear and obvious that Eddys standards have slipped, he's still great and we all love him but Ortega really hasn't put a foot wrong since he's been here. I think Ederson has gotten too comfortable as the 1st choice keeper after Bravo and Zack.","Shite game for us but rather it be this game than the derby

Fully expecting Grealish and Mahrez partnership on the weekend after today","We'll have to wait until next season to know for sure, Pep and Bielsa must have seen something in him","Not worried as the season isn't even halfway done.

But we love gifting points to managers under pressure

Don't want to hear anything about the Rodri handball at Goodison anymore, we're all square",Thank you and I hope not to see that ever again.,He's been played out of position every game tbf. Imagine playing Mahrez in midfield every game and how well that would go. That's pretty much what is happening.,Loved his aggression in the later stages of this game as well. Not to be bullied,"In truth any team can lose to any team especially with the world cup coming up and players be it consciously or sub consciously worrying about missing it .

This perhaps happened today perhaps not but my biggest problem with this City is how slow they are in build up play.

They make it so easy for teams to adjust into their defensive shape by players taking far too many touches before releasing the ball.

They made Gomez of Liverpool look world class by doing this. Then he came crashing back down to earth when Leeds used speed to expose him.

This is not even tika taka, it is just tika tika where players just past the ball not to draw opponents out of position but just to retain possession.

The defenders are especially awful at this with Akanji incapable of passing the ball unless you are next to him and Stones just being useless in general.

It was he that kept Toney onside for the opener and his all round play was not worth talking about.

For a side with so many technically gifted players I am appalled that they do not play 1 touch football often enough.

Silva, Cancelo, Gundogan, Mahrez, Grealish, Rodri and all the defenders barring Laporte are all guilty of holding onto the ball for far too long.

Then of course there is Pep who I rate as the greatest ever manager but he does some strange things from time to time.

He has the best squad in the land, Grealish in my view put in his best performance in a city shirt  against Chelsea the other night and should have started or at least come on.

I did not see any merit in having Stones and Gundogan come on for the 2nd half.

City's next game is in at least 8 weeks time or so so why on earth did subs not come on.

It is not as if the players were playing so well. But that is Pep for you ever the enigma.

To win the cl this squad needs pace and directness on the wings and the ability to counter with such ruthlessness.

They also need someone other than Rodri to prevent counters against them as they are too easily got at.

They concede too many chances and a lot of the time it is not even from brilliant play from the opposition. Just a long punt catches them out too often for my liking","We barely played with possession, so much booting up the field just to lose it. Liverpool was definitely playing intense but we rarely attempted to slow down the tempo and take control.",Hahaha has the adrenaline started to wear off yet? Think I need to lie down with an iced glass of water,Fans behaved,50 mins? It was a full 70 mins on my watch LOL,A hattrick to Harland and Foden sounds like a fan fiction one of you weirdos type up before the game,"That's a shame, was hoping this result would make it a 50/50 whether they play him or gomez when walker is out",Been that way all year,"Nah, I wanna see Haaland play more. Pep is being too careful. Look at Messi and Ronaldo, they NEVER missed games if they weren't injured. Hell, if Barcelona was leading 5-0 and Messi scored 4, he would be pissed if he was subbed off at 80 minutes. He wanted to play full games every single game, and he ran much more and was much more involved in play than Haaland ever will be.

Pep messed up this time. This is not fair to Haaland, and not fair to the fans! I don't  EVER wanna see Man City go off the pitch without scoring goals when we have a goalscoring machine on the bench who averages damn near 2 goals per game!

Misc thoughts

Foden needs to start, but I didn't like that low effort run late. Sometimes he throws his hands up and glares too quick. His body language makes him seem angry at times.

I am unable to deal with Joao slander. Couple bad decisions lately. But he's an absolutely crucial part of our team tactically, especially when we don't have any other real fullbacks available. Call was correct and clear. But he's got to be smarter...he's so crucial to the set up, and gives it all every game. 

Really good to see Haaland back. You could see the team rally around his presence. There was a greater sense of belief for everyone when he entered the game. We had a clear focal point and it helped our chance creation.

The ugly: elbow to the face is not a corner ffs.","Did anyone else notice that weird pressing shape from the Villa forwards? It was weird, almost like a triangle shape pointing towards our CBs, around Rodri. Usually one of their midfielders would also come from behind, forming like a diamond shape around Rodri, completely surrounding him. 

Rodri is easily our most important player in buildup, as he’s a funnel from the defense towards the midfield. This diamond of Villa players around him, however, cut him off from the CBs in front of him and Cancelo and Walker to his right and left, meaning we’d have to go around to the wingers. This could’ve probably been overcome if our wingers were direct and incisive (they’re not) or if both FBs were able to carry the ball forward or make plays from deep (they didn’t— Walker especially). 

Now even in spite of all this we almost overcame their press anyways through sheer quality and it wouldn’t have even mattered, but I think it’s still super interesting to think about. I wonder if other teams will take note of Villa’s setup today and how it upset our passing lanes and rhythm.","Wdym grealish definetly didn't have an ""average game""",I wouldve loved if Guardiola let Haaland stat pad this match but great win nonetheless,He doesn’t play much this season.

CTID","Whilst I agree he is a more improved player (long time coming, but good to see), feel there is just something missing, that could be trained into him with time.

A downside is he can hold on to the ball a little too long in some attacking transitions, which usually leads to the foul. 

Also his mind is more focused on retaining the ball as opposed to daring a through ball now and then, but that's probably more pep's instructions so can't hold that against him.

Overall he's progressing and is always trying hard so I definitely think he's the more deserving player in that position right now. Would like to see him in a more free-playing role like David Silva used to do some time in the future.",Laporte? Hard tackles? I think you're confusing him with someone else.,rico lewis played a great defensive 2nd half stop blaming the young lad,"Very bad call from the officials especially that idiot Michael Oliver in VAR room. The ball was played to Rashford who was in an offside position and was running towards the ball.

Whether he touches it or not is irrelevant, he was interfering with play ergo he was offside.

Having said that City and Pep really need to start having a hard look at themselves.

I really do not understand how Pep cannot see that Laporte is hands down his best central defender and it is actually an insult to me that Ake is ahead of him.

They need to start going for the jugular as they used to as too many times I have seen them just pass the ball around just to keep it away from the opposition.

Against Everton and again today, they went a goal ahead and didn't finish off the opposition.

Far too many poor decision making and going backwards with the ball.

1 touch football has got to be the norm from now on as too many players take far too many touches which gives the opposition time to regroup.

These players are Silva, Mahrez, Rodri, Cancelo, Walker, Ake, Stones, Grealish.

As for today's game Ten Haag played with Shaw as a central defender and with the deadliest striker in your ranks, you couldn't exploit the situation. That's disgusting. They are just too slow in the build up play.

&#x200B;

I know Silva is a big fave in here but he gets on my nerves. With his ability he should be hurting teams by opening them up not covering the whole blade of grass.

Compare him to Fernandes who passes the ball quickly to put the opposition on the back foot, he holds on to the ball until the opposition is back in good defensive position.

His shooting is awful and he is another who passes the buck. He ought to be braver with his passes not all those safe, short passes that retains position but little else.

Apart for Rodri every player City has that is not a defender cannot tackle to save their lives.

The other night I saw Armstrong go past 3 City players . Today it was  Wan Bissaka who has no dribbling skills just going past them. It is astonishing to watch.

I also do not understand how a team that is in total control of a game gets opened up with 1 long ball time and time again.

How many times did it happen today? I pass and a United player is all alone while City defenders are all bunched on the other side of the pitch.

Even the winner the most in form striker in the league was left all by himself while City players were all ball watching apart from Akanji and Walker who were trying to stop Garnacho.

I dont think that happens if Laporte or Dias were there.

This is worrying for City as big players are off form KDB, Silva, Foden, Walker and Cancelo.

They definitely need pace down the flanks which no one in the current squad can provide but they also need to abandon this trying to control games and be far more explosive in their passing, pressing and application.","They might have won but I was left totally unimpressed by that display which sadly is becoming a common theme this season.

I am sad to see this as i never thought Id ever see it but Pep has become a defensive coach.

No not like tactical coaches but very similar to Del Bosque when he was the manager of Spain.

None threatening passes, keep the ball so that the opposition does not have it, hardly threaten at all with pace.

All about control and possession for the stats master that makes for very poor viewing.

I read on here that he is still scarred from cl exit of last season and there seems to be some truth in that.

What a great shame because this season has  been underwhelming so far save for the heroics of Haaland and his crazy goal scoring feats.

A manager whose teams have played the most brilliant football from Barcelona to City via Bayern has been reduced to this crap.

Reminds me of Tele Santana whose Brazil sides of 1982 and 86 played the most brilliant attacking football ever at the world cup to managing club sides that played such mind numbing footy that would put the most defensive Italian coaches to shame.

Some fans are calling other fans entitled because they dare criticise this present city side or called them out for not making enough at the etihad but they are not being entertained.

&#x200B;

Too many touches, not playing the obvious pass quickly, default position is to face your half then go backwards until it is with the goalkeeper, carry the ball needlessly and going down blind alleys when a quick 1 two pass would have been better.

Players like Gundogan are the epitome of this control first crap football, risk free passing back to my defence so they can go back to the goal keeper who would then proceed to be clever by trying to make a cute pass.

The only 1 that does not care for this kinda footballer is Alvarez, he presses, he defends but not to waste time and when he has the chance he is going to attack no matter the score not protecting what we have rubbish that City have now become this season.

Why didn't you just leave Foden, Alvarez at home with the other 2? You might as well as have had.

CMON CITY!!!💙💙💙,"I’ll bring up two silvers linings since I see, and personally feel the same negativity - De Bruyne, despite a lot of missed passes delivered a cross far post to Haaland that they both saw so clearly I can see it happening time and time again, Ederson played his sweeper keeper role perfectly today

We’re unbeaten and I’m a United fan tomorrow

We’ve had an objectively strong start",Love that our fan base are cheering for him to turn it around. So many others would just attack the player rather than back them. Hope he keeps this up,Sterling who?,I’d imagine Alvarez new what he was getting into when signing ang staying with the first team. All it’s going to take is Viking niggles and Alvarez starts every game,Why the fuck did the reporter about the gun celebration? Sky is trying to go under his skin asap?,
100,What could Pep even say to his team right there? “Sorry guys I know you’re tired but I can’t sub”,Especially important because it was against the run of play. Newcastle were pushing and that sucker punch took the wind out of their sails,Another decision that you will not see again all season just like the Rashford one. Thank god it didnt cost us.,relax on your last sentence,This sounds familiar. We gave similar reviews to early Rodri. He was never going to be able to live up to Dinho's standard...until he did.,"Shit tactics = Shit result 

Doesn't take a huge amount of brain power to come up with that. 

Handed over Arsenal the trophy on a golden platter. Might aswell throw in the towel now...",Would’ve liked to have seen Alvarez get a run out. His intensity in the press would’ve helped towards the end there. Perhaps he’s too fatigued? Tough result to take considering that decision on the United goal,"Both sides flat. Idk wether to give credit to City for being smart keeping the ball in our own half to bait the press or criticize us for not being more aggressive. One things for sure, another game where Grealish is useless and completely reluctant to make ONE good decision but yet still ends up with a random assist.",well damn that was a hot pile of shit......,I thought the exact same thing! Had a scary thought picturing them the other way around,"Another lackluster, frustrating performance against a team facing relegation. WHY IS THERE NO KILLER INSTINCT IN THESE GAMES?!?!?!?!  I am getting sick to death of it. These are teams City needs to be putting to bed... WHY AREN'T THEY?!?! 

Please no more Mahrez and Grealish at the same time.... Nothing Ederson could have done on the goal. 

Newcastle dropping points to Leeds at home probably the only silver lining today.",Super odd game. Went against so many common narratives about this team,He has never played like that until this season and that one game against Lyon,We mommy-dommied them the whole match,just terrible,"Bernardo was such a warrior today. Foden was great and Rodri as well, but today was not our day. Nothing seemed to work, and I don't understand how we didn't lose by a bigger score today. It was frustrating to see and sad how many chances and passes we missed and wasted. Hearing the boos for 90 minutes, the bad passes and the lack of substitutions... a bad day.",Glad we won today. The ref was on a big power trip today and the red card caused chaos. Onto the next 💙,you do sound like a massive hater 🤣,Yeah KDB knows how to kill a game.,Pep is a god and Haaland is a goat,Never even heard of Liam tbh. Got hit by the Pete Wentz effect there,In big games it’ll be Haaland.,"Add onto that an unfair goal dismissal (and the unfair pen but we missed anyway), and we had the better chances in both halves of the game even with 10 men, we played well",what? you want 3 RBs 3 LBs in squad if you inc ake?,"Haaland has the flexibility and agility of Ibra, the shot of Ronaldo, playmaking of de bruyne, and the mental stability of Messi. He’s gonna be the Goat.","Botched a few chances, the shot that hit the post really should've gone in.",Support whoever you want brother. SCR Altach is my team ;),I like Haft-Time attitude. Great game.,"We are still second on the table. Would've liked a win here, but kudos to Villa, they were good and we looked tired. 


Not good, but our rivals aren't doing any better anyway. This shouldnt affect the title race, should it?",Shut up r/soccer in less than a minute of game starting,I’d say the only negative tonight was mahrez,"I think Alvarez is gonna force Pep's hand sooner or later. Loved him and Haaland up front against Forrest, hoping to see more of that.","One genuine question ? Isn't the bench looks too thin this time compared to last season. No extra full back options & if Bernardo leaves, then less options in midfield too ? I'm not much aware about young players on bench",
101,Games like these make me appreciate it when KdB is healthy. Only player that consistently tries to make something happen that isn't sideways or backwards.,[deleted],Trossard always looks like he just came off a 6 day bender,akanji is nothing special. the rest i agree with,"I'm really not happy with Phillips this season as he barely was available and when he has been he's been pretty terrible. We also had Pep's awkward remark about him being overweight which hints at unprofessionalism. Then there is the factor that we sold academy darling Lavia who has been great for Southampton.

But ultimately we all know Phillips is a decent player and I'd be surprised if his performances don't improve with time. Rodri's first season was pretty disappointing too. I remember thinking he'd flop because he could not play the same way Fernandinho does.
I hope Phillips puts some effort in and Pep is willing to stick with him for another season. Otherwise it will be another terrible investment, with a small silver lining of us potentially using Lavia's buyback clause.",Luis Van Gaal masterclass by Pep.,"We did not deserve to win but that rashford goal was clear foulplay. 

It's fine. Now we are in a slump. Which means there will be changes. If pep can use the ref's bias against us and instill some of that ""us vs them"" mentality in the squad again then maybe we have a chance at the tittle. Or UCL.","Respond to this comment with relevant post-match-related:

Hoping for an Arsenal loss now, only way to make this feel even a bit better.","Haaland fully fouled Fabinho, the real issue was giving this absolutely dead team too much respect. That they could only score with a longball says everything. 

Oh well. They’re mid table. We will probably win the league and now they’ve got a red for Klopp and what looks like a nasty injury for Jota unless they were time wasting. Probably worth the 3 points for them though but we just need to focus on beating Arsenal and Tottenham when the time comes.","What an effort by the team. Stupid (maybe a bit unfortunate) decision from Cancelo, but after that everyone gave it their all.

Lots of competition when Walker, Laporte and Ake are back",https://youtu.be/R0a5VJX0_6s,"Eddy didn’t give away a goal. 

It was similar to the palace incident, he was hindered before releasing the ball. 

When he put his arm back to get momentum he smacked the crotch of the Sevilla player and it wrecked the throw. All the city players, and most Sevilla players, stopped because they knew it was a foul on the keeper technically so no one tried to defend the shot.","Very, very nice",
102,Erling will be off to Spain years earlier than we thought if we keep having games like that. Genuinely insane how afraid they are to play him the ball,Always were,Man how much does the NBC studio team hate City??,"I am not a big fan of Eddie, but he was quite good today, he didn't have too much to do what he had to do he did well enough.","Ortega was taken off as a precaution because he might have a hand injury. Philips was better in the second half , still needs more consistent game time which he isn't likely to get this season unfortunately",Would love a 433. No Fucking about. Just players in their natural positions like we used to when we were creative and actually looked like we had a plan.,I’m honestly broken. 1:30 in the morning and I know I’ll just cop it from my friends and family for us losing now and it will sound like I’m making excuses. Hopefully pep can go on a rampage but don’t think they can change the result.,[deleted],So that was awful,"I think Chelsea's goal scoring improves from here until the end of the season after signing Felix and Mudryk. Chelsea is averaging just over a goal per game. I don't think it'll be a substantial improvement. But i could see them averaging closer to 1.5 – 2 goals per match for the remainder of the season. The scary part is that even if their goalscoring improves, Haaland could still potentially finish with more goals scored than them lol.",FUCKIN FUCK,"Foden off the pace today, shame as I was excited to see his name on the team sheet. Looked good on paper, but the formation did not work at all. At least Pep made early subs to change it up. Hard won match, Stones was the MotM for me.",He’s still good there though,Isn’t that everyone with this cup?,"We’ve stepped down this season massively, and I think the main reason is the lack of a settled back 4/walker being out.

So fucking smooth with it,"Haaland's first-of-many hattrick really distracts from the fact that our first halves in the last two games were horrendous. 5 goals in two games, 4 of them in first halves. Still, great to see that our attacking force is capable of balancing out the defensive weaknesses.

Also, Liverpool just equaled the record for the biggest pl win, what the hell. Klopp must have absolutely smacked them for the loss to United lol",So so wasteful,One good game doesn't negate his bad performance in previous games.

Not a big fan...",Haaland 🐐,
103,What is this handball stuff?!? Mental!,It's good to be hated.,Tim Howard and Robbie Earle sound completely gutted that City won lol,"Did decent. He replaced gundo so wasn’t really playing at left back. Took 2 shots, one deflected for a corner and one sailed over the bar.

The game was done by the time he came on so not a ton to do","He had a great shot early on, pinged it off the crossbar but would have been a great goal.

He played okay otherwise. Misplaced a few passes here and there but seemed to do alright defensively. I’m hoping he can get more minutes in this system somehow, coming from Leeds to peps system can’t be easy","Been said by a lot of people here but that was on Pep.   Rodri clearly needed a rest but doesn't have the competition.  I like Rico and think he will be a quality player in the future but should have started Ake at LB and Dias and/or Laporte at CB.  Taking Mahrez off was interesting when he's been amazing recently, even if KDB needed to come on.  I don't know if it's just me who sees Nasri with Grealish, the way he keeps slowing the game down.   I felt we were too pragmatic, wanting the ball but refused to do anything with it.",I knew this shit would happen.

Only good moments here or there. But just shocking from everyone on the pitch.,\*Sigh\* This is Anfield I guess.,"Fulham embarrassing I have to say

We were unreal

Foden has to start more, such a difference when he came on.

I love Jack but he had a shocker today, barely made an impact","I think Jack plays best when there's an actual left footed FB behind him, he also isn't a goalscorer (highest Prem tally is 8) so maybe he's just limited in what he can do.",I think Leicester was as well. Exactly the right game plan and they could have easily got something from the match.,I can't believe it but we are probably the most dangerous team rn!!! This year I don't seen anyone remotely close to stopping us in the CL! Perhaps PSG or Real can come close but we now have Haaland!! Let's Go!!!!,,Pep has already intimated he will be playing the kids and subs for this match.,Yes we have but to finish top of group we need to beat sevilla and we only need a draw against dortmund but if dortmund draw with copenhagen we could lose against dortmund and still finish top of group,"You know, this is Man City. We can play poorly but still score 3 and win the game",fucking pep lmao,Yep. Let me dig his username out 🤭,"First touch is best in the world. His ball control is good, but Palmer is slightly better. 

I know it's silly, and Palmer hasn't achieved even 1% of what Mahrez has, but I think he has the best potential of all our academy players.","Really want Cancelo and Rodri to regain their form 

Not sure if change in system is disrupting their game",Foden on the left wing doesnt work anymore. Every time he gets the ball the only option is to go backwards.,"He's not going to shut everyone off with 1 game which he doesn't really do much but did well enough, right now he need to be more consistent for the next 3 games and then people may change their minds.","good, the debate was moronic anyway",">Haaland's movement in the box might even be a level above Aguero's

I know recency bias plays a role here and stats might be misleading, but Aguero's off ball movement will never be a level under any player in the history of football. The way he created space for himself and others was incredible. I'd say Haaland is on the same level, he's just taller, stronger and faster. 

Haaland might be the better player in the future, but let's at least try to keep it real.",Hallandale the beast,

Tearing cockneys apart, again!!!","Not bad, i think he would've scored his first goal if there wasn't a last minute deflection","Agree with everything you said except Alvarez. I think this was likely his worst match for City. Just seemed to be missing that burst of quickness on several occasions, and found himself a few steps out of the play on a few occasions as well. Thought he had opportunity to score 1-2 goals.","The away loss to Spurs in a cursed stadium isn’t what bothers me. You can basically cross this fixture off as a loss every season anyway. Just absolute voodoo. 

My problem is the listless way they played. Something isn’t right with the squad. They haven’t gone on their typical run this season - far too many stinkers like today. So unorganized, lacking in creativity.",That’s my manager https://twitter.com/city_xtra/status/1614273618472476673?s=46&t=Vbo0zxla_RRvrQIbemwsaA,"In the 89' were talking about ""City haven't done enough to deserve this lead"", 25mins after gushing over Ake's worldie",Pep masterclass he’s just playing mind games for the derby,"In fact his substitution, after what by his standards was a lackluster performance, perhaps shows that Guardiola is getting frustrated with his recent cold streak….","We are fucked. We're likely gonna be 7 points behind after tonight and with our fixtures in January, I could see it getting bigger. This was a must win game against a team in poor form at home and we put together a shambolic performance. Retaining our title is getting harder by the week. It's not looking good.",Can Chelsea even field an XI on Sunday? Forfeit incoming,This is actually a good question you know.,"Their A team is basically a B team these days, not our fault","Ok. Pep’s dream to play with 11 midfielders is not really working. Way too slow in possession. The only chances we had, outside of set pieces, were when we attacked with some sort of pace.

Poor today:
-KDB, Stones, Akanji, Haaland, Cancelo, Gundo

Below their normal level, but decent:
-Foden, Bernardo, Rodri

Satisfactory:
-Ederson, Laporte

No one had a good game. You can blame the World Cup, but there have been several games like this one so far this season. It’s been said several times and I agree, we have not been very good and have been bailed out by great individual performances. That is not sustainable. Hopefully the team finds more rhythm in the second half of the season.","Probably wouldn't have mattered at that point but Thiago should've gone off instead of getting a yellow. Commentator downplaying it by saying ""he slipped and it made it look worse than it actually was"", as if he didn't just two foot someone with studs up. Doesn't matter if you slipped or not when you could've ended someone's professional career.

I hope Klopp gets forced to do anger management at least or something.

Anyhow, fuck it, onto the next one. Arsenal will drop points too.","I said in the pre-match thread I wasn't expecting a comfortable win 

That was fair tighter than even I thought it'd be damn. Big 3 points!",Nah not really,Motm performance my god I actually felt confident when leciester were coming forward with his performance today,"Good win but I'm not impressed with this idea of playing with your food because you're comfortable, it can breed a dangerous mentality that can cost us certain games in the future. I like how the Germans do it, they'll pound you from start to finish, your feelings are not their concern.",,"Whenever he starts with the gloves and then takes them off, he’s always shit. I’m. or exaggerating either. We have a running bet/tally of how he performs in that situation and it’s never quality.",ye,We haven't played brilliant footbal excep for one half vs United. We have been flat and Haaland show has covered lot of cracks,That was fun,Don’t tell that to EA,‘On net’ isn’t a phrase.,"We just don't have any striker like we've had in the past and I mean that with the greatest respect to Jesus as well but Haaland is just something entirely different. He is such a goal monster, a goal Behemoth.",Another game that should have been put to bed very early,We must be watching different matches … He was far from MOTM … he was average at best and is still holding the ball too long,Alvarez-Nunez is closer and even that is generous to Nunez.,"It may sound like a height related joke but for guys like kun, Line of sight is a bigger hurdle than it is for Haaland. Kun also had to unlearn some of his inctincts and had to fight his way back. 

Haaland is certainly better at it tho.","Chelsea fan here. Gotta say Haaland and de bruyne is a terrifying link up. Match between us should be good, hopefully we can get a title charge going and match you this season",

He's been huge this season.","Ake needs to be the LB moving forward, he's been so consistent and rarely makes mistakes","I thought he played great, and if that shot had have gone in would have been a goal of the month contender.  I like his confidence to have a shot too, we need that in our team.","Well, every game we don’t get the luxury of playing a mid table team in a league below ours",a lose against arsenal next week will dim our hopes of come back (honestly it's best for us just to limit our expectations for this season ). also We should forget about cl with this performance. I am looking forward to what we will do on the summer transfer. cuz I ain't seeing winning shit with this playing style.,Well that was shit,Absolutely I was laughing most of the times so much bias,That was fucking shit. No effort at all. Some of them players should never play again. Plus side a few less games. We need to sort our game out as we have been shocking this season.,"Exactly right. Just need patience sometimes

Remembering these are just people end if that day is impo. 

Stones is the ultimate example. Had a horrid spell and now, probably our best CB. Sometimes ppl just go through hard patches of life. Im sure everyone here has. Foden might be a superstar but really he is still just a kid. Patience is all we, he, and the club need imo",We haven't played well this season except for United first half. It's for everyone to see ans it's getting progressively worse. People here who can't see this need to get their heads checked,"Is Blue Moon also Chelsea's anthem, because that was all I could here from the stands all night?",Potter deserves to at least have a summer transfer window... he came into a team that he had 0 input in building... I think he should get some time to work the team in his vision and get rid of players that don't fit his mold. He was cooking something in Brighton before leaving... Chelsea should at least give him a chance to do it there.,Yes how can players like Darwin Nunez and Mo Salah compete with the likes of Cole Palmer,"We've been awful ever since the draw vs København. Can't help but think that goal just before halftime ironically worked against us? Pep will have been saying go on, keep doing what you're doing and the result will come. 
It didn't, mostly because no City player on that pitch was on it today. They were all awful. Shameful performance, no other way around it.",understand if he wants to leave but i would love for bernardo to stay at city.  wonderful player,"Winning 2-1 after being down to 10 men for over an hour against a top 10 team... yeah that's a sign we're on our way to defending our title

Come on Chelsea!\*

\*valid for 24 hours only",How Chelsea didn’t score in that first half is beyond me,"We may as well rest them against Sevilla, we did win the group right?","Remember at the start of the season some people were saying Foden & Haaland can't coexist? 

Lmao.",,">Clean sheet, no injuries and a much better second half defensively.

Haaland was injured and subbed off.","Oh no, I still hope I can see haaland wears it🥲","I am aware. Still not sustainable. If Gomez isnt ready to pick up starts in PL, then someone else who is has to come in next window.","This is really it. The result was never in doubt and I don't have any problems with Grealish or Mahrez but I just don't want to see them together.

Pair Grealish with Alvarez/Bernardo

Pair Mahrez with Foden

Or at least try it with flying overlapping wingbacks",TAA is also good on freekicks.,Absolutely from what we have seen he is pretty solid and is only 20. It will only get better great player in a few years,"I can’t believe they picked to show Leeds vs Brighton instead of this game on tv as originally scheduled in the US, go soccer!","Walker is so off it I want cancelo on the right and gomez on the left next game. 

Foden is also not right and having grealish back will be big when he’s ready to play. 

But apart from those two I wasn’t too unhappy. We should of been up by two and then they lose confidence more and it’s a different game. 

Walker not passing there was just stupid. But at least we got the draw. Onto CL.","What did he do besides the goal and getting kicked in the ribs?

Only 30+% possession, a brilliant strategy","Idk, I saw him play for Anderlecht and was never really impressed. I think he’s alright going forward, but defensive he’s a liability. He played in his old midfield role today and he was ok, but we also had a comfortable lead when he came on. 

When he first joined he had a few good moments, but his form dropped quite quickly after that. As far as respect goes, respect is earned on the field. I honestly haven’t seen him do much that earns my respect. 

And before someone brings it up: yes, he was voted Anderlecht POTY, but none of Anderlecht’s players made it into the team of the season. 

That said, I also don’t agree with people slagging off players after a bad stint. An honest assessment will do.",Kev’s just had 3 games off,"Roll over and die against your biggest rivals Arsenal and pull everything out of the bag against City.

Being disallowed against the rules of the sport sucked, but it was still fantastic.",wasn’t there (had a wedding) but heard it before and i’m pretty sure it’s the yorkshire Pirlo chant we’ve nicked from Leeds,Especially given that Pep is fucking hell bent on playing inverted fullbacks in both sides as well.

Fucking hell what a relief. I literally have no words other than these to describe Haaland. Great win 💙. Also special mention to Bernardo and Alvarez was also quite good imo","Well that was disappointing, mainly cos they're shit.

Feel like his media training (or his adherence to it) is less than that of the others and it’s refreshing,"He is a decent player, but nowhere near what is expected of players in this team. Would have been better off sticking with Wilson-Esbrand.","I was so impressed with his footwork today. Some nice control and turns…hoping he keeps pushing up. There were two games a couple months ago where he delivered two balls over the top for Haaland early in the game that looked so promising.

Ake being able to deliver that ball over the top to Haaland would be a nice added piece of the attack that we aren’t seeing much lately",That was football terrorism,Robbery.

Hoping for a full 90 against saints to see what he can do. I don't think he deserves the hate and that outting probably backs that up.

Probably needs some more energy though yours right",Was he playing in the World Cup?,Pep only making 1 change is disgraceful.,City have won every single game this season Grealish has started. Just mind boggling not to play him at all,Don’t know what to think about the red card or our penalty but 3 points are the most important. KDB played like usual and many others played on their level. Grealish didn’t play well today Imo.,"We changed our midfield and changed our way of pressing. They did not get through our midfield until we scored the 2 goals and Pep took off Rodri and Gundo for Bernardo and Kalvin. 

We dominated the midfield till our goals.",Cant really blame them,"Let them pad their stats with useless goals, lol.  We got the points.",,We really should go for a young and quick rb like Frimpomg from Leverkusen. Or Dest.,We drew to a Danish side. That is fucking shocking no other way about it,Christmas *,"Literally both great at carrying ball forward but both on the pitch slow ya way down. Silva or foden have to be in. In form mahrez though is another kettle of fish thou too. Lessons learned surely anyways

Edit: spelling",Yeah you got it,And Cancelo,Please start Alvarez over mahrez. I love riyad but Alvarez is so much better rn. Need some pace and pressing,Fuck that game. Villa are poxy lucky cunts.,"Yeah, we weren't great and still somehow bagged 3 lol

KDB was off it today too.",Liverpool really thought they had the goal differential edge after that 9-0,"Palmer is such a great talent. An opportunity creator, and he does it with class",I was hoping Alvarez also scored a goal.,
108,Hate to say it but it’s not happening this year sadly,He is absolutely incredible. He does the “invisible work” but its the most important,I thought Rodri and Dias were immense tonight. Great win CTID 💙,Feeling for him he is going to get relegated,"This exactly, he has been playing like this and overlapping with Grealish since the WC.",Brain dead performance,"I hate blaming the refs, but I haven't been this aggrieved at a match's officiating since the 17/18 Champions League matches vs Liverpool (maybe Brighton in 20/21, but we'd already won the league by that point). Not only was that an incredibly clear offside decision, but Casemiro blatantly pushed Cancelo over in the box and nothing came of it, not to mention their constant fouling getting ignored and the lack of yellows. Joke of a game.",The fact our best defender down the stretch last year scored THAT goal with his weaker foot is absurd. Worth every penny of that 41m,We'd better tear United to bits,Rival fans? Some of our own “fans” constantly bang on about “but £100MM”!,"Need FODEN to start more, in the span of 14 minutes we made 4 or  5 chances from him, jack is nice if we play against a fast paced, non defensive team, as he slows down the play a little bit, but FODEN is needed against the other 99.9% of teams in the pl, 

We need FODEN.

...and better defensive positioning",Gutty performance 💪,he played great apart from that pass. we dominated that left side . he is a baller .. just need a guidance to improve his decision making,and Alisson,We need direct wingers,I want to die man how do we keep losing to them,football's coming home,That’s a terrible take we dominated them,How are you going to call them bus parking wankers when they had the same number of shots on target as us?!,Lets gooooooooo,,"Even just no more PKs for Mahrez-anyone else that was out there stood a better chance. Alvarez was deadly in AFA from
penalty spot FFS.","2/3 of the game with a man less, with the best goalscorer the game has ever seen sitting on the bench for the entire game.   
Piss poor and boring. This is the kind of thing that comes back to bite teams in the ass. Watch Pep put his trust in Haaland against Liverpool, then someone clips him down and fractures his leg or something, and  he's out for the remainder of the season or something horrible like that. If that happens I'm gonna be pissed!

STOP ""SAVING"" PLAYERS! Messi and Ronaldo NEVER sat 90 minutes on the bench in their 20s, and if their manager EVER put them there, they'd put in for a transfer request!",Rodri’s passing and positioning was off for large parts of the game,Yeah it’s too one-dimensional to have two wingers who are both stuck on their inside foot,Who are competing with Bernardo?,"Nope, no way, mahrez has god given talent with that first touch and ball control, he just needs to chill on the Nutella sandwiches and get fitness",Never in doubt,"Villa were well drilled and worked hard, but Christ were city poor. Foden and Kdb both looked like they'd never played before",I don’t think Dias was that poor. He made some good blocks and seemed commanding. Not his best game but then again no one had their best game today,Brilliant summary 🔝,Lost ?,"The more I watch Grealish, I could see him being a great holding mid or even center back.",
109,maybe we need fresh ideas hmm,Was looking for this comment. So refreshing in a match where the opponents showed so little class.,"CIIIIIITTTY, TEARING COCKNEYS APAAAAAART AGAAAIN","I think Pep referred to this, we should have beaten forest 5 1 or something had we took our chances, that was a frustrating game.","Careful, mate. That snow ain't clean.",We've played like shit so often this season that I'm starting to get used to it. And that makes me sad.,Genuinely makes no sense. There’s not a single person that can come up with an argument that rashford did not influence that play,I couldn't agree more on what you say on Jack's performance. He was the main attacking force in the first half and exploited as much as he could every ball he had. He's surely finding his form and I'm sure that we haven't seen his top level as to how he finds a comfortable place in City 's playstyle yet.,The worst performance of the Guardiola era,"I like him and think he's been a good player for us, but I don't think it's unfair to say there's a middle ground where he hasn't been awful but there's still room for improvement.

People over focus on G&A though you're right. I actually think Grealish has quite a unique style of play for us where he controls the tempo of the game from the wing position.","De Bruyne 7.7, fuck off with that.",Something is wrong with foden. Ghosted every game since the World Cup,Best touch I’ve seen from him in a while also. Multiple excellent takes under pressure.,"i was sat behind the goal, his positioning was awful! ball seemed to crawl past him","ederson 6 - better shot stopping than usual. could've done better but not really at fault for their goals.

stones 2 - spineless performance specially in the first half. inaccurate even in the most simple actions.

akanji 5 - not the same guy from his first games in blue. that instant impact looks long gone and he's been decent at best.

laporte 7 - put a shift out there. saved us from conceding more and moved the ball really well in build up. he's definitely back.

cancelo 4 - didn't do much good but at least he tries. embarrassing dive.

rodri 6 - overall he played well specially on the ball. up there with laporte as the ones that can be proud of what they did on the pitch today.

gundoğan 2 - awful. couldn't control a ball to save his life and missed a sitter to make it 2-1. he is the only one to make good runs in the box but should've been hooked for alvarez or grealish earlier in the second half.

kdb 3 - he played like he forgot to shower before leaving his house so he was trying not to get too sweaty. embarrassing performance, no effort whatsoever.

bernardo 5 - way more threatening in the build up than close to the box. should've moved deeper earlier but that's on pep.

foden 6 - disgusting performance until he scored. stopped treating the ball like a bomb and had a good second half. it's a shame his crosses never found haaland.

haaland 5 - he starved upfront. but the one clear chance he could've had he slipped and fell on his own arse. put it on a plate for gundo to make it 2-1.

pep 2 - 86 minutes of a dull performance until he made a sub. why the hell did gundogan finish this game on the pitch? could've moved to 442 with bernardo-rodri pivot, foden and kdb stretching the pitch to cross and alvarez-haaland upfront but prefered to hook cancelo off leaving us more exposed to counter attack. or even why didn't grealish get in after that incredible performance midweek? could've moved bernardo cm and foden rw to get grealish on the pitch at lw for gundogan.

ref and var 0 - handball on the line, penalty not given. chokehold on laporte, penalty not given. brentford players wrestling haaland, laporte and stones in the penalty area so many times and the ref decided to have a talk with them and made us retake the corner instead of simply whistling the fucking foul. second week in a row that the refs come on a mission to the etihad, this time they succeeded.",Honestly kinda deserved everyone played below average they weren’t up for it,Never in doubt. 👀👀,"We bossed them. Built our attacks well but lacked the final ball or touch. Chelsea poked 2 good chances from counter attack and Ortega made great saves. We had 1 clear chance that first half and Mendy made some good saves.

2nd half we bossed them again and were fully in momentum when Mahrez scored and then Alvarez followed. Sadly, we made subs, sagged off and let them control the midfield. They had more possession that 2nd half and did create more when we took the lead but Ortega made saves as well.

Overall, we were better. The people who say they played well are the ones who claim having possession means nothing.","I was watching in a busy pub, and they had the volume down low, and I could still hear the City fans singing.",Haalaad doesn't need overload players that why we are strong to counter now.,,I’ll never forget this match. It was so boring and lacked anything other than a cleansheet against our future charge Jude b,would prefer not to start mahrez no matter what,Yeah that was a big save people need to remember that as well as his mistake. Not a good game not a bad game just average for him today,I think Mahrez really gets exposed when we play Stones at RB. Kyle generally has some good interplay with Kev and Riyad around the right - but Stones doesn’t have that pacey run through to open up that space. ends up Mahrez standstill,"He's still learning, you can tell he's coming from a team where he was the best player on the pitch, but with that selfish-ness there's also the great confidence to rinse more senior experienced players and that's a great thing... also, I know he's gotten better but Mahrez is probably equally selfish so Palmer is a like-for-like sub",You think palmer is better than Mahrez ?,NEVER SAY DIE.,What's happened to our defense we can't keep a clean sheet to save our lives,"They were just ponderous and slow thinking. Blame Dortmund, early kick off and Pep.","Stop, I can only get so erect.","Mate he was brilliant. Looks at home already, so comfortable on the ball and when he rarely had to defend he made light work of everything that came his way.",Do we need to have a talk about Grealish ALWAYS stopping the ball? Teams are clearly going to filter the ball to his side…he needs to think more direct,
110,Why am I seeing so many people complaining about losing bets on this match? If you saw the Forest match you wouldn’t be betting a penny today,They're winning it this year...,Pep is going to tear the prem limb from limb,We all be hoping they are still having a hangover from the trophy lift tommorrow!  🤍🖤🤍,The fans don't forget it either. We should make him a song so he falls in love with the club and stays forever.,Teams are content to clog the middle and let us work from outside - then they’ll just hack down Grealish and give us a free kick 40 yards out. It works - why not do it?,"The offside rule is so stupid, akanji knew Rashford was offside so didn’t go towards the ball so technically Rashford wasn’t interfering anyone.",De Bruyne absolutely slept through the WC. I feel like he hasn't woken back up since 😢 He's one of my all time favorite players but has looked really sluggish of late.,"These guys need to get their shit together, go on a retreat or something because no one is connecting from game to game. Otherwise this might be the first year since 16/17 without winning silverware",Fr,The disrespect on Mahrez in this thread is unreal,"Great we won but overall poor team performance . Foden continues to disapoint cas he tiptoes around fails to move things forward, show greater initiative and take some risks. Believe Palmer is now a better alternative and should replace Foden in upcoming FA cup game again Chelsea. Cancelo needs more game time to come up to full match fitness. Hope DeBruynes form also inproves.",Absolutely,"lets see:  
Wolves, Southampton, Newcastle, Leicester, Charlton, Nottm Forrest, United, and us  
so....yeah, nobody to worry too much about except maybe Newcastle lol",Baldy complained about not having 5 subs when there was only 3 and now doesn’t use it when offense didn’t work 🤦‍♂️,"Every time we were put in a dangerous position it was from their backline on the counter. I can't say anyone played really terribly besides Cancelo defensively. KDB, Bernardo, and Foden were fine enough. We lacked finishing ability. We shouldn't expect Haaland to score every game. That was going to be an amazing dream.  

The biggest problem was Pep not bringing on subs. Mahrez and Grealish should have come on. If we can't beat big clubs domestically then we can kiss the CL goodbye.",Relief that's all i can say,Huh? Chelsea were awful.,"Won the free kick that Kev scored from, at least",Is United just sick Ronaldo or is he injured,,"Alvarez can fill that role, watch his River Plate tapes and he is definitely a direct creative and scoring threat

Wish Pep trusted him more than the usual suspects",Marhez yeah but Grealish hard to do something when everytime you touch the ball your getting thrown 10ft and refs do nothing,Palmer is still raw. We cant afford to play him in any meaningful game yet.,Don't start Mahrez period. He has yet to have a good game so far this year. He needs to be benched until he finds his form again. Right now he's straight 🚮,"“There’s almost a network affect” 

Also know as (United)^-1

Swear they could have made 2015 Messi a flop",It is in the States.,Haaland Hat Trick,"Can't believe Foden stayed on for the whole 90. Has done nothing the whole year and is made invisible by Ashley Young in 2022. Just unacceptable really. Alvarez has to come on. I don't get why it was Mahrez.

Really missed Phillips. He'd have been the injection of energy into the midfield to take control instead of having the exhausted and not very physical already three of Rodri, KDB and Gundo get bossed in the final 10-15. 

Got what we deserved in the end imo",Didn’t have to be any better,Only negative i could think of was Riyad,">because I decently rated him at dortmund

Read this as ""becuase I recently dated him at Dortmund""",I was really nervous before the game but my goodness what way to put those doubts at ease! The team is slowly gelling under a new system. Haaland backs up his claims that he thrives under pressure. Once he was away on the second you just knew he was scoring. So excited for what's to come.,
111,Guys forget the second half. We were robbed of one of the biggest robbery in the end. How tf did we not get a pen??????,I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure you’d need to be above 62 points this game week to be safe from relegation. Only Arsenal are sage,"Pep's strategic decisions seem to boil down to ""You'll never know until you try."" And he tried Bernardo at left back and it was a disaster.  Pep owned up, moved Bernardo to a midfield position and City immediately became more dangerous.  Bernardo didn't let his rough first half get him down and he kept on chugging. 

An absolutely massive result.  Messy, chaotic, tense but City kept grinding and pulled it out.  We're not really here!",Very tough indeed.,Plus he had the run to create space for Kevin’s shot. Peps wet dream that. He was very good today on a bad assignment,"Terrible once again. I’m not surprised but still disappointed. 

We have no fight in us. Just playing too slow. 

Haaland again making great runs and getting no service. 

Both pep and the players have been abysmal ever since the World Cup.","Is it just me or was the refereeing fucking shit house? City probably deserved to lose but holy fuck, abysmal.","Needs to improve his distribution though.

Unnecessarily kept the pressure on City the first 30 with the passing.

Brilliant shot stopper though, wouldn't mind him playing in the CL.","Good game guys, just not your day sadly.",yes true,"imma just go ahead and say it, i dislike the system pep is using. you’d think w the players on this team we’d create more chances and be a little creative? sick of the restrictions pep has w some of these guys let them fucking play, this system shit is limiting some of them. we fucking lack creativity on BOTH wings, foden being our most creative winger but even then pep has him on a fucking leash. pep needs to stop being fuxking stubborn and tweak his dumb ass tactics also you wait until 3 means is left in regulation to make changes lmao? how many times has he done that this season smh.","Haaland is truly a poacher lmfao.

Dude is invisible if he doesn’t get good service",Trust in tixi,Some of the filthiest passes of the game. He doesn’t look 100% yet though. His current pace is a bit of an issue. Great game from him nonetheless.,Naaah What a shit game man. My weekend is ruined. Looked like the players were thinking of the world cup from the first whistle. Absolutely shite performance and with an even more shite refereeing…,"I feel more or less cynical about this loss. Yet again, the Anfield curse looms over us. We played okay, but at the same time there was gonna be a point where we drop points. There's plenty of ""what if"" scenarios whether it the fouls, VARs, missed chances, etc.

But hey, it's our first PL loss of the season, let's try not to be too gloomy about it. It's Anfield, what did we expect? Even with the team with have. That place is Hell on Earth.",My heart man,"they had better chances before we scored, but they certainly weren't the better team",He was good not great. Bernardo was having the same issues on the other side purely because of Leicester’s game plan.,Haaland. He is the Jonah Lomu of the football world.,,This was a game of bird watching.  Except there's no birds either.,"We were a man down almost the entire game. Yet you're mad at our team for being 'invisible'? 

Makes a lot of sense, you're clearly very smart.",I read he's gonna be a pundit for bein sports with Salah for the world cup so i fear he won't have time to get in shape while the tournament is going on.,Stones has been a fuckin monster all year he’s in incredible form right now,"Pep was optimistic about him being fit for the world cup, so we'll be looking earlier than that.

Upside to shoulder injury is he can still do lower body work and, subject to stability, some running and ball work. Won't be involved with training games until its healed up enough. So it won't be as long a road as Walker's will, since he's recovering from leg surgery",Tks,"Cut the long balls and we tidy up. There's a correlation there.

Mental second half performance though. Weird to say that Kev was our worst player in the 2nd half but it ends up being true",Perhaps we'll stop playing this formation from now on.,Nah first half v crystal palace,I'm starting to think the Haaland guy is pretty good,"Midweek in Spain, gonna be challenging for fans",Great game.,
112,"Liverpool fan here (I come in peace, especially after last night), how that handball at the end wasn't spotted or dealt with is astounding. Another blatant failure of VAR",I want 100 of his babies.,"The Blue Moon rises over London tonight, boys!",I don't think even Kalvin's mom thought he had a good game,"I think it's his first 90, yes. Definitely agree with you, but at the end those mistakes are what's costing us games at the moment. He'll only improve, for sure.",Pep outclassed today. Cancelo loan has to also be messing with the team. It’s on Pep to get them straight,"Sane, Sterling, and Jesus were all never properly replaced. Some new direct wingers absolutely need to be bought or promoted soon. Seems like Pep is the only elite coach who doesn’t truly understand the importance of these types of players in the PnP era",Yeah stood on his head,![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB),Still important to keep the pressure up! And city did that.,I’m not gonna talk about grealish for he does it all on his own playing like that.,Great win! This does not slip!,😂,Pretty sloppy for both teams. Ake motm in my opinion. Fabinho with a nasty challenge on Rodri late.,No need for panic stations but fuck me am I bored of these endless crosses with so few chances created by them.,"People hating on Cancelo in the match thread calling him a ""horrible defender"" and ""woeful"" is embarrassing. Sure he was not good today but he is still by far the best fullback in the world.","Arsenal fan went OFF on me in the group chat lmao. THE SALT. I sent the cry meme of Haaland 😂😂

that was a very Spurs win.... but hey down to 10 men before 30 minutes... you take whatever you can get. As a City fan I was super excited about the penalty, but as an American, was disappointed Jedi gave it up. but NAH FUCK IT.. City all the way haha.",From my watching of the game we were the better side Ortega was amazing.,He did win the freekick for the goal and was arguably MOTM,Those 2 shitty goals at the end have dampened my mood a little,,We are terrible when we just try to play “keep away”.,"It’s pretty much that way when Mahrez is in there at all, but it is glaringly worse when it’s him with Jack on the other side. Still, without the red card we would have gotten away with it in this one.","“What have you done for me lately?” He’s been very selfish in the final third, always looking to take a shot or dribble and he’s been wasteful with his chances. Great in previous years, but so far this season he’s been frustrating to watch.",[A meme is born](https://i.imgur.com/KVMFmbm.jpeg),"Ah didn't know, thanks, at least that gives Southgate one less option to start with 2 DM's at the WC",And Bernardo surely he’s the engine of this squad,Thank you based Charlie Kane,Villa fans going to be buzzin’ in the championship next season.,One of the worse and considering they had 10 men … If they had an actual striker on the pitch I doubt we would have won,"Agüero/Müller hybrid regen. 

Jülian Álvarez",With $800 flights midweek….tough ask,"Welcome to Manchester, Erling Braut Håland.",
113,"this team doesn't deserve anything this season.

blend performances every other week and we always think the latest one had to be the last one and pep is gonna fix it and the players are going to step up but they simply never do.","I agree, felt like a repeat of forest/RB","I was so happy when grealish scored. Stats are all people use to hate on him. Plays with his heart - gives it his all 
Speaking of was so emotional watching Bernardo Silva run his lungs out. We have really missed that.
Finally KDB.  Thought he didn't have a good game but he really is HIM.","thought phillips was shit, id have zero trust starting him in any game","First full game, second start.","At this point, we have no business winning the league. We’re consistently inconsistent.",Gifted a win to them. I legit can’t believe it.,Why would anyone shit on him?,"Worst 1st half we’ve played for over a decade. 0 shots on target all game.

Every single person who travelled down to Southampton on a work night needs refunding out of the players pockets.

That was pathetic.",Rodri was a big drop off from Fernandinho initially,they said no January signings but we might need a  right winger like seriously. this team lost its flair man,"Also, please play Bernardo on that rw 😍He is soo good there",You savage 😂,"Pretty sloppy on both sides, but Liverpool were atrocious in the midfield and defensively. We gave pool a few too many easy chances and kept them in the game. We should have quite a high xG (close to 5), but looked rusty in the final third. While we didn’t really take all our chances, we deserved the win.",We have terrible counter attack defending.,"Kind of a big disappointment - we looked like we were scared, sleepwalking, or thought this was the second leg of a tie with us up 3-0 after the first leg. Reminded me of the painful CL final two seasons ago. Arghh. 

City spent so much time when in possession either playing out from the back or passing back out of Liverpool’s half, like there was no way through Liverpool’s midfield, let alone its back line. Because we couldn’t retain possession, Liverpool had plenty of chances to break and kick long balls over the top. Liverpool’s finishing was crappy, until Cancelo’s blunder gifted Salah an easy 1 v 1 against Ederson, so it’s lucky we didn’t lose by two or three.

Don’t understand why Pep again refused to use more subs. Why not sub in Grealish - whose strengths are progressive carries and ball retention? Also, I wish he had moved Cancelo to left back - since I can’t remember when Cancelo’s ever been good on the right at City - Akanji to right back, and used Dias and Ake as CBs.","What a match, what, a day. Ladies and gents

Goodnight",They had more chances but they weren't better.,"He should try to take on his man more instead of passing back. City got the free-kick when he did that 

I wonder if pep asks him to play safe.","All the spotlight will rightly be on Haaland, Kev and Foden, but my god Akanji was an absolute beast. Amazing performance by him.

Gomez and Palmer looked great when they came on. 

Alvarez needs to get more gametime, but it’s tough when you’re competing with fucking Haaland.

Cancelo, Bernardo class as always. Gundo too.

Grealish looked decent.

Ederson should’ve done better for the first two goals.",,We can’t play our best 11 every game. We set up a team to at the least get a draw and that’s what we got. In Pep I trust. Also Mahrez is in bad form but he’s still valuable. We won the group today,I think that is a very different story if Haaland is taking the pen over Mahrez. Very surprised Julian didn't get to take it...,"dont bring goals to judge the contribution of a player in a team, we are not Penaldo fan. Lets look at how many time he lose the ball how many big chances he missed how many time he is too lazy to trackback to defend. And how about comparing his goal with his expected goal (xG) ?

&#x200B;

It is the system and other players creating space and chances for him. 

If he doesnt play the other replacement would still scoring goal too.",Reminds me of my last relationship...,"Yeah, it's a damned if they do, damned if they don't kinda situation for the second tier teams.  Use 2/3 to stop Haaland, and there's plenty of room for the others, don't and He'll rip them apart.",For the first time ever i noticed him look fat at the beginning of the preseason.,I see we're adopting Ole's comeback strats,"When Mahrez came in, I instantly lost all hope. And I never wanted to feel this way about Riyad.",It happened,Such a typical South American player in that he’s a proper busy body. Might not get the plaudits week in week out but guarantee he’ll work harder than most!,Maybe because he shouldn't be playing on the left?,"Couldn't watch it, how was Grealish?",
114,"We don't play like champions of england. There is zero confidence in our passing, it's all safe balls to the side then back recycle again and again. I don't know if it's because our gung-ho football has caused us so much heartbreak in the past, especially in the CL that Pep is scarred and insists on this kind of football now..but I just don't see this as a positive development. Forget our players ignoring Haaland for most of the game, Foden and Alvarez didn't even get to play. Kdb is in a bad form and our next most creative player is Bavaria. Will we see any change? It's been like this for a couple of months now. I'm not even mad at the refrees or the players just Pep. Why don't you make any subs baldy??",Seriously. And he keeps his cool and all of his passes connect. He has been immensely reliable in terms of keeping the ball.,I love this fuckin team,"Personally I feel Phillips didn’t look like he wanted the ball enough. Seemed good when he had it, but for a player lacking in minutes I expect to see them asking for every single pass.","Yeah he’s really good playing along with Haaland, sort of like the Muller role if that makes any sense but playing him with Haaland would definitely let him develop into the city system of creating and feeding of spaces","Tactics was shit, attitude was shit, refree was shit , halaand my boi didnt got any chance, spurs played well what a bad day fuck!",Absolute robbery,"Pocketed Saka, Scored the goal. Ake. Maldini regen.","Happens I guess. Perhaps good to have a stinker now and not at the weekend. 

Cancelo, Gomez and Phillips all pretty dire for varying reasons. I think the back 5 problem proved too much when we had too many passengers at the back and in midfield. 

Southampton played really well too, good press, well organised but I feel we beat ourselves. 

Hopefully, with at least the main guys rested, we can smash United at the weekend.",That was the most telling thing - Grealish tracking back in the 87th minute while KP was nowhere to be found.,This fucking team man - we’ve been so poor since the derby,"We really had a poor game today. I mean, even with the subs, that goal was kind of lucky because the keeper should have saved it.

If Haaland isn’t scoring, he is pretty much a dead weight in the team currently without offering much in terms of building up the play or causing trouble against the back line.

We’ve got a big away derby game against a united team that is in green form. 

Not really looking forward to it.",Wow that sucks.,That Mahrez comment….,"MAKE SUBS YOU BALD FRAUD!!!! 

Gundo should've been pulled off after 65 minutes. We conceded because no one had the energy to run back except for Akanji.",Welp see yall next game lol,"Sorry but Foden and Cancelo deserve some big criticism for performances like this. Not the first time. Foden didn't look to play forward or direct once, playing the ball back to Ake every time where it was difficult to get the ball into a forward position being outnumbered. Not chasing the ball down despite only being on for 20 minutes is inexcusable. A complete contrast to Berardo and De Bruyne who were giving everything.","City dominated the first half. Dominated to start the second half, went up 2 goals, made subs, took our foot off the gas. The end was inconsequential.","what? We absolutely strangled a very well organised side today, with a little bit of luck would have had 2 or 3. Good performance doesn’t always mean winning bu 4",Should start with clean sheet obsession like 20/21 season,,"Relax, we were playing not to lose, no need to step on the games likes this, and Dortmund defended very well.
Boring match to watch though","Liverpool usually shows up for City games and it’s at Anfield, which means the refs might put their hands on the scale to help Liverpool. Remember the same fixture last season? Milner pole-axed Bernardo and didn’t get a much deserved second yellow.",A shit ton more like,"To be fair, that is what we said abt Real last year before that fking game happened",That's how I'm looking at it too. At least he scored though.,I’m from the states and played the sport my entire life and never once have I heard the phrase ‘on net’. It’s ‘on target’ don’t embarrass us,"Stones looked short of confidence, yet again, Gundogan and Alvarez completely changed the course of the game, and Mahrez looked useless.

At least it’s not a loss, haaland and kdb are fucking ridiculous, villa are a scummy club, mahrez ain’t it, Alvarez needs to start, stones is way out of form imo",FTQ 🇮🇪,"Stones gets some confidence boosting, even if the goal was called off. Perfect day","I think it's likely after the last few games in the prem that pep has been telling the guys repeatedly ""slow down"" and not to rush it to the strikers too quickly. Palmer being a kid eager to impress is probably taking it a little too far.","A hattrick was on for Haaland, so do you think he was slightly mad that Pep took him off?",

Perrone was good, had some good 1-2s. Needs more game time",To think Chelsea fans didn’t want him at the beginning of the season. He would crawl into their starting XI,"Just an all around impotent performance going forward. The goal was an absolutely idiotic mistake from Rodri but it wasn’t like Tottenham dominated the game, City just had nothing going forward.

Performance. Ever. But there is bigger fish to fry so we move on,I don’t know what happened this season but we were a different team with him in the IWB role last season.

He doesnt deserve the city shirt, but this is what we get from overhyped english players","I am sorry, but I fuckin hate Grealish...but at the same time I love him...Don't know how should I feel to this guy.

* Kyle Walker is having a rough time with fitness issues
* Mahrez has to catch his stride again ( one last time before he dips forever)
* Gomez is not in tune with our backline and was keeping the opponents onside. Sancho fucked it up or else we would have been punished earlier.  Easy mistake to rectify
* Cancelo fucked up and gave the pen away and while I sympathize with him, Pep is not.
* Who tf was our CDM after subs ?  Ake ?

Great game, now can we please stop fucking leaking goals!","It's not the result that is disappointing, it's all part of the game, but rather how we ended up playing, we fucking played almost 2 seasons without a proper no. 9 and yet scored for fun at times against teams like villa yet now it seems like watching pre relegation Burnley play just with back line and keeper getting more passes among them and after that just hooking the ball long towards haaland and hoping that he makes the run and finishes well. For god's sake stones had more dribbles than foden. 

And what's with Kyle asking for the ball every other second for him to pass it to cb again and again, i mean rodri could've done that himself, no? Just damn annoying.

 And with this patch of bad form from him, if we are to continue in this inverted full back setup it's better moving joao to the right and playing ake/gomez on the left atleast one side is defensively secured that way.","I like Grealish and still back him to come good, but
Bernardo is so much better than him. I dont think its even close.",Happy New Year,He's good at passing and on the ball and shooting outside the box.. perfect for CAM. but I'd agree he did freeze a bit too much on the edge of the box a couple times tryna spot a pass or opening.

At least Lewis and Grealish showed effort, but they were still poor and effort is the least we should expect. 

The entire team seems to have the attitude that they don’t need to play a through ball because that’s De Bruyne’s job and got exposed when he wasn’t on.",Disgraceful. We have been so so poor for months now. There is something seriously wrong with this team. Not excited for the next game.,"No joke, I completely forgot saka was in.","Absolutely shambolic, embarrassing showing tonight. Fair play to Southampton, they played well and got the better of us in every area.

United are fucked on Saturday.",If they win they will be two points behind us and full of momentum. No need for that. Just take the draw.,"There's something about Pep against former legendary players that are masquerading as managers that he absolutely sucks against smh.

Edit: Also, Akanji and De Bruyne were terrible to differing degrees (De Bruyne to the farthest extent...)","Mahrez scored one tap-in and played like shit and people forget how bad he is this season. 
Wait until next matches when he keeps playing bad and cost us a lot of points.

I think the chemistry he and Mahrez have is super underrated.",The most skilful player on the team is over reacting.,"Our squad has ZERO natural wingers FFS. It's not on the players. 

It's poor squad building. 

Pep doesn't bring on Grealish because he like foden can't outpace the FB. 

Why shouldn't we go for a pacy winger in the winter to have a luis diaz like effect?

Our entire squad was fit today apart from one FB who makes no defence in the final third.",Still can’t believe Pep didn’t give Grealish a chance in the second half. Hard loss to swallow but playing at Anfield is always a hard game. Defense looked shaky on the second half. We move on and win the next game. Let’s go City!,"Thank god we didnt get yet another winner VARed, its too much to deal with.",Not a chance. My Chelsea brother almost broke his TV. So many missed chances,"Also, you just _know_ he would have made it onto the end of Kev's cross on that counter in stoppage time. How many lunging goals has he scored stretching out a leg like that? 
That pass from Kev was sublime, but he's clearly calibrated to Haaland being on the end of it, not Gundo (who in fairness nearly got there anyway)",The defending for 3 United goals is pathetic and that's the reason why we failed to win the UCL we seriously need to work on that and don't ever take the foot off the gas again,,Porntega was serving in those recent training photos that came out,The most okayest match I've seen all season.,"Honestly just getting through is enough based on where other teams finish.

Grealish looked good today. Personally, I like it when somebody is unhappy about being taken off. Shows they wanna play and want to be there.

117,"So disappointed in our performances... I'm beyond being upset I'm just disappointed. Cannot fathom how Pep saw that performance and said ""you know, I don't think I'll sub we'll be fine"". We won't win anything this season and if I was Haaland and running around for 90 minutes with minimal service, I'd be out of there unless shit changed up. Same for Alvarez. I cannot believe we didn't make a single fucking sub. I'm not a Pep out guy, but don't think we'll ever win UCL with him as our manager.

Main things to take are that we weren't great in the first half with Jacky G being the only real attacking threat other than an insane Zalan-esque bici from Haaland that was quite close to going in and a KDB curler that just went round the post.

Ake is insane and deservedly benching Cancelo, Walker and Bernardo were very bright when they came on and Arsenal had pretty much the full team out with their subs bar Ramsdale, Rico got torn up by Trossard and the Martinelli cut back to the byline in the box was quite dangerous.


Overall, a lot of promise, but a lot to improve. Typical City.","I think my main comcern is that KDB and Phil simply look terrible. Jack is a nice ball carrier, but not a real weapon. Hope for Haaland or nothing else. We are going to get smoked out in CL",More to it than that I reckon. Pep isn't happy this season so he has to show his players who've gotten complacent that they aren't a fixed player,Garbage,It’s poetic and beautiful,"This. Palmer, Gomez and Foden clicked well. They were so dynamic.","Thought Palmer was brilliant, especially in the first half. This sub is so weird sometimes.",Why is no one placing some blame on Pep’s inability to change that stoner doucebag outfit he’s been wearing lately.  😉,Hate playing battling mid-table sides away. Oh well.,This teams fights till the end,Maybe it's the speed at which he shoots idk man,"The same way some people says teams “deserved a point” for a loss because they played well, I think we thoroughly deserved the three points.","Great performance by Haaland and Foden but these players need to do away with the mentality of not even trying anymore when we’re far up. If anything, they should push the foot on the gas even more. At the least, defend properly.",,We have a team that can see off this match comfortably. I'm just bitter with the result tbh. We can do better.,"Why risk an injury to Haaland in the last 10 minutes in a meaningless game lol. Can you imagine the shit-show that would come down on Pep and this club if he'd come onto the pitch and picked up an injury? You would've been furious and calling for his head I bet.

No issue at all with the substitutions today. Keep Haaland fresh for Liverpool, and we move.","even if we lose at dortmund, we are favourites to be 1st. KDB/Haaland/Bilva should not be starting that game. Every club's been losing players for WC, we've been lucky, so far.",I don't know mate.

They could not breathe in the last 20 min,Phillips+Akanji is wasted money. We could've gotten Bellingham+Gvardiol for this amount and keep shift Ake left to solve the LB problem,"Mahrez has to get a start every now and then as well.

There's many players that are good enough to start up front, which is certainly a good problem to have.","Wish I could say I'm surprised, but I'm not. We joke about the 1-0, but uh, yeah, here we are. We are so very cursed at that stadium","Why isn't our team playing to haaland? If we can't play with him then play alvarez. We have w very different strikers, if one isn't working the other should come on",Arsenal fan stalking your thread. Yes it’s true. I’m hopeful Ø and White will help free him when we play for real but even without the goal Ake was the best player on the pitch and completely pocketed Saka,Why did they play like they were uninterested. And why was Grealish subbed? Apart from him and Gundogan everyone else seemed very lazy..,He was at the match so doubtful he was sick.,How did Gundo miss that .. fuckkk… well it’s on Arsenal fully now,"Plays the side we want, puts in the worst performance of the season, switches it up with some of his earliest substitutions ever and takes the 3 points. Dark day for /r/mcfc. We now enter a 3 day period of mourning.",I thought walker played with freedom and was fearless due to years of experience,He’s never been great at creating space for his shot.

His pace would have fucked up villa. Pep... BRO use those fucking subs... just had a mid week game, what are you doing?!?!? 

Ton of missed chances, Haaland easily could have had a hat trick but the keeper did make some good saves.","Yeah for sure. I've been on mahrez back a lot since end of last season, great player in his day, but recently it's not been his day at all. want to see him live up to his new contract. 

This hopefully can be a turning point. Such a shame he didn't get to that ball that Sa gathered up. But he was enjoyable to watch again which I haven't see in mahrez for a bit.

Deception for Saturday, more than you believe.","I disagree, you'd think more details would be given for fodens injury, but no.

Obviously this is sarcastic but damn what a difference those boys made",,Community shield but in the winter vibes,"Boy would I have loved to be in the dressing room after the game just to see what Pep has to say now that the players won't be around each other for over a month.

We need direct wingers, we need wingers who are pacey, direct and very forward thinking because we clearly don't have that sort of threat and it showed today.

Abysmal performance and I don't know how it's going to change in the 2nd half of the season to be more consistent because we haven't been that good for a while now, conceding goals first more than we should and then having to come back, making defensive mistakes that would be otherwise admonished otherwise...

I mean, I don't know how we're supposed to even be in contention of things like the UCL ffs but it's the hope that kills in the end every year.","Hate that we just can’t show up for this fixture.

Now just need Zinchenko absence to expose Arteta as the hairy fraud,"Some of these players should hang their heads in fucking shame. Seriously not playing up to City's standard at this start of the season. Foden and Walker have been levels below their usual standard and Rodri, as much as I am his biggest fan, has been unusually off the pace as well.

Gundo had a bad game but besides this match he's nearly been our 2nd best player so that's not really a huge issue for me.

Passing was off for the whole match, every single pass or cross seemed overcooked. One KDB moment was enough for a goal but god damnit we should realistically have lost this match the way it was going.","Yeah good signs he's in the right spots and got the silky touch back.

Also.. what a username",Right??  I  know it’s not the case here but it’s crazy how under the radar he is because Haaland is such a big get and so clinical. Alvarez looks like the perfect pep striker.,Why are you upset a player wants to play?,can someone explain to me what grealish contributes?,
120,Pep needs a rest,"KDB did okay i wouldn't say played really well and totally disagree with your Ake outplaying Newcastle on the left comment.

Ake is meant to be the left back and every dangerous moment came from his ball watching.

On a different day and against a more clinical side that is 3 goals conceded.

It is something that needs to be addressed as that was really poor.

I didn't think Walker was that good but nothing came down his side which means that teams now no to target City's left as they will get so much joy from there and Newcastle did today.",Would have crawled through glass naked to be in that away end for Grealish’s goal,"For as much stick as Phillips is getting you’d think he was first campaign Rodri, or Grealish, or Cancelo ….",That's exactly my thoughts even before he came here from Leeds.

Or we just have to beat Arsenal twice",They need to cope somehow,We played like Chelsea did against us. Nuff said,"> Grealish is first choice for the foreseeable

And he deserves it. Runs till the final whistle.","Not sure why Pep makes subs at the 86th minute when he should have brought in players after Everton tied it up 1-1. Foden has zero impact off the bench, Haaland isn’t in form, even though he’s bagging goals, he’s been a bit off since returning from injury which is normal, and KDB needs to be benched for a game or two and rest. He’s either exhausted or something else because he hasn’t been himself for some time.",You forgot about Kepa. That Grealish pass what shite.,,"His crosses were great, but in the build up he definitely looked a little lost. He kept running way too close to KDB and would pass at the wrong times. His shot attempts were cumulatively way too inaccurate, but he creates space for his passes/shots very well. Quite a lot of positives. He can sure run at people, hold up possession and his crosses into the box were well timed.",I only got to listen to the match on the radio. Did it seem like some of the players were playing within themselves? Possibly to save themselves for the World Cup?,We go again.

Not much you can do when you’re down to 10. Can’t read much into anything past that.,"Cancelo is our LB starter. Walker is now injury prone.

We need another true RB in case Walker is injured. Center backs can play there, but against good sides it's not ideal.","You need to know you can take a loss before you know you can win. The final against Chelsea was proof that we are capable of going all the way, the loss against Madrid was just that bitter taste of reality to keep the team from being complacent...

The last time the boys were this relentless was the stretch between 2017-2019 where we played the best football ever. Not saying we're going to win the CL this season, but it's our best chance.",I wonder if avoiding player marking and just keep 8/9 players in their own box gives them a greater chance,,City win today!! Fantastic gumption to come back and Haaland now 6 goals in 4 Premier League games!! Now need my Huskers to win in Dublin!! GBR!!!,"Can't win them all.

I do think Stones needs to be very careful, especially with Akanji in the mix now.",He made his run way too early and Julian couldn’t play it because of that,"It’s unbelievably close but has to be Alvarez, because he’s an Aguero regen and imo is more satisfying to watch because he has that explosive flair.",drugs are bad mkay,He's a cat lover,

City to PL..",Agreed. Was hoping for SOMETHING and ended up walking around for 25 minutes,"Nah, can’t drop kev. He was integral in every goal we scored today, unlocked the back line with the passes to mahrez and ake.

I think KDB needs the minutes to get back to his top and I’d take kev at his best any day over Alvarez right now","On a positive, maybe this is the year we win the CL because Peps using all his experiments in the league.","Bad form, no passing to the best striker in the prem, biased ref. If Arsenal win today, which is very likely, our prem hopes are gone.",the one I know says he doesn't care because it was the B team.. but said pre game (after the line ups were released with that B team) that Arsenal would win. yeah ok buddy... lol,"Shit performance, but full credit to Soton. They kicked our asses. Deserved win for them.","Yeah, he dropped foden for palmer",Over 10 minutes of standstill stoppage for a tech issue completely killed any rhythm of the match. Absolutely unacceptable at this level and should be consequences,He’s always a step faster than I think he is lol,,Carabao but not to worry,Foden was great,We really really need to fuck them up in the reverse fixture.

Not complaning by any means though,,Well that was something,[deleted],"Yeah, they pressed high, came out to beat us, put us under pressure had great energy and had some really quick automatisms on the wings to create dangerous situations.

Leipzig had less possession but they felt more dangerous than City . Ake gave em too much space at some point that Leipzig almost scored a goal. I love Bernardo, but Pep should have subbed him and given Alvarez a chance to change the attacking play. Rodri felt off too.","Just want to echo your sentiments for Ake. I said to my dad I’d have given MOTM to Ake if it wasn’t for the quality of Foden’s goal. He’s working his arse off every game and getting crucial blocks in, playing well up the pitch. Different beast this season!",Maybe he's not worth 100 mill but he's worth at least 80 so stfu,"he sucks. Rodri backup my ass. He isn't even good enough to see the pitch in cup games if we're being honest.

I’m thinking Alvarez should have come on at 60.","I don’t mean to be negative, and maybe I’m in the minority here, but it worries me the difference in quality of our attack when haaland is on the pitch versus when he is not.

This game could have gone on for 5 more hours and that team wasn't scoring. Alvarez and Haaland barely touched the ball. How is NO ONE trying to get them the ball the whole game??? What is the point of having 2 strikers if no one can find them??? Haaland is putting in the work, he's getting into good positions and literally no one is even trying to find him!! is it jealously of what a super star it is? like I just do not understand it. Why are we NEVER trying a few times a game to just unleash Haaland on the break/counter?? 

this possession game isn't working. there is no creativity, and then every game it seems like 1 mistake leads to a goal for the other team on the counter. so whats the point of the system to not create and then they score anyways?? 

Bad game all around today. I can't blame Alvarez or Haaland, they weren't involved. Ake was the stand out for me. Pathetic response to Arsenal dropping points.

Now you might see stats that day he has lots of advanced passing or whatever the fuck the wording would be but I'm not getting into all the reasons how those stats can be misleading. You just need to watch him play to know what I mean.

- we lack pace on the wings. Was severely missed during counters.

**a player moving from, or standing in, an offside position is in the way of an opponent and interferes** with the movement of the opponent towards the ball this is an offside offence if it impacts on the ability of the opponent to play or challenge for the ball; if the player moves into the way of an opponent and impedes the opponent's progress (e.g blocks the opponent) the offence should be penalised under Law 12

Weak in midfield and let's not sugar coat it we played 2 academy players in Foden and Palmer and a former Villa and Leeds player in midfield.

None of the front 3 are feared. Seems like a sacrifice with the games ahead so, as I said with Chelsea last week in the FA Cup I don't mind if we go out as  there is more important fixtures coming up. You just don't beat Chelsea then Liverpool then lose to Southampton, 

Gomez shouldn't play for us again, not had a decent game yet - spend the money on a LB and have Ake as back up","I feel like he is still yet to measure up to the price tag for us. At least in the sense that we are not usually a club that likes to break the bank. We tend to buy impact players that cost between 25-65 mil. I am a huge fan of Grealish, and I think my hesitancy will only abate with time. Once we have a few more years with him, he’ll look better in terms of a long term investment - amortization, continued integration with the team and play style, etc.","Ratings indicative of time on the ball, bc KDB was awful today. I might have to send him some new cleats bc he was slipping constantly. Rodri was fairly poor. Bernardo hasn’t been Bernardo all season. Uncharacteristically sloppy from pretty much everyone.

Rashford basically set a standard now of “unless you physically touch the ball you are not interfering”

Meaning you can’t be offside unless you touch the ball. If that holds, it’s fundamentally changed the game.

Think they all looked like they need minutes.,,Akanji,would’ve preferred losing with a semi-competent ref,"Flabbergasted that Grealish did not play. Also with the quality that Haaland has, he had enough chances to score one today. People say Pep fucked it (which he might've done) but it's hard to make that judgment when the players were miles off their best; we barely completed any meaningful passes, constantly wasteful in possession. That has to be on the players, not Pep.

I predicted that this whole build-up just screamed a 1-0 morale-boosting victory to Liverpool and it turned out that way. Now they're gonna go on a streak and get top 4, most likely. Also wonder if people are gonna start taking Arsenal seriously as title contenders??? We haven't been top of the table for a long time so perhaps stop acting like we've got the league done and dusted already.","I love what Sam Lee always says about Bernardo: it’s like Pep tells him every match, give it everything for 65 minutes and we’ll give you a rest. Then when it’s the 65th minute Pep tells him to go all out for another 30 minutes and he somehow has the energy",Who is the better option? Walker is unfit. I’d much rather keep Ake and Stones at CB. Lewis contributed brilliantly in both defence and attack today. You don’t see Stones or Ake doing that at RB. I say give the boy a chance.

We are only 5 points behind arsenal if they win. And 24 games left.

KDB had no space since he had no winger.   

Defenders all over the place with no idea who was supposed to be where and who was marking which space.

Loved the full commit to a 343 (first half) and I thought it worked well, it hid our weaknesses and strengthened our attack. (Specificty cancelo given way more space to attack and not defend isolated in 1v1s, and gundo had more freedom which he did create chances and it let Bernardobe even more effective) 


Eddy looked actually really good and kept it close. He was near perfect at everything. 


Dias looked so sharp. 


We totally dominated the game and chances which is why I think pep coached a great game. (I don't know what subs people wanted him to make he didn't have much choice apart from alvarez which he brought on) 


Nunez is fucking shit lol


Haaland let us down today and cost us the game. He was fed so well and missed a bunch of good chances,and his technical ability looked off compared to everyone else today. (Not saying I hate Haaland but we have to be honest and say he wasn't good enough today) 


The ref was ok(?) I guess. I thought everything was OK, and he's not gonna let that goal stand after looking again. It's so 50/50 that should have stood but at anfield this is what we come to expect. My blame goes to the var room for making him take a look. He had a great view no reason to make him to go the monitor. 


I'm not all that bothered tbh if anything I think a loss will just wake us up.

also mahrez working well with grealish is just an outright lie, both of them play better when foden (or maybe silva or alvarez?) is on the other wing. i think ive seen only one game when they played together and it went well, hopefully that continues

Mahrez is in a bit of a rut rn but he'll find his way back, he still shows moments of brilliance when dribbling, and obvs that divine first touch is unmatched","No one in the right mind wishes for a draw before the match begins.

We lacked creativity in the midfield today… These are the times I wonder why we let Raheem go. We lack the proper wingers to take that 1v1 and run passed defenders. Mahrez is all we got now. 

Grealish did fantastic today and most of that was from defending! 

Rico Lewis is young and has been put in a difficult position. He needs time to adjust and grow, let’s not judge an 18 year old kid yet.

As for the Haaland debacle, the opposition KNOWS that we’re looking for him. They place themselves to prevent us from playing to Haaland. There was a literal wall of midfielders between Haaland and our midfield. That’s why Pep wants him to become part of the build up, so that his movement is less predictable and defenders are forced to move and possibly lose his mark. He has 25 fucking goals for fucks sake, you all act as if he had 1 goal the whole season.",Ref was shit,VAR/reffing tbh.,"None of them deserve any pay this week for that shite of a performance. I don’t care if it’s the Carabao Cup, we cannot be embarrassed by the team currently sitting 20th in the league under any circumstances. 

Whilst we have Pep playing his ridiculous game of “I wonder what would happen if a centre back played all the crosses into the box” or “let’s play a fullback at centre back” we will never be a serious team that can win the Champions League.

And will someone please see sense and finally reaffirm my view that Kevin de Bruyne has played terribly since the World Cup? He passes like he’s blind. He gifted Chelsea two big chances in the league game last week. He needs dropping until he learns how to pass again.","If Rodri is injured or suspended for a big game, I would rather Stones at DM than Phillips",Tired of Grealish,Literally used the first half to flex on the armchair tacticians 😭😭😭,,i saw a few actually.,"Every time we put on a pathetic performance like today, I think about the 17/18 season. Why on earth did we utterly dismiss that vibrant and energetic style as if it was just an experiment which didn't bear fruit ? 

What we showed today literally has nothing to do with what we could do back then. I think we should be humble enough to admit that we attained perfection in that particular season and that we should try to emulate that to a certain extent, while retaining the good things we added since then. 

More than anything, we need two fast wingers like Sané and Sterling. We already have our main man up front. De Bruyne and Silva are the two AM we need. The Stones and Dias CB partnership was rock solid last season. Cancelo is perfect as a LB. We need a natural RB just as much as we need two natural wingers.   We should build a healthy routine by playing the same players in the same positions. 

And for God's sake, Pep, stop tinkering with the player's positions. Stones is not a RB. Bernardo is not a RW. Foden is not a LW. Just accept that you found the key to perfection and stop demolishing the beautiful work you created.",We’ll win the champions league the day we beat Liverpool in a fully packed Anfield,They’re crying so hard lmao,That is what rags do.

Grealish LW",">Hope he isn’t too disheartened playing alongside the goat. 

Nah he did well for Argentina so far ;)","Aguero had good off the ball movement but I feel like what made him special was his quality in tight spaces under pressure he'd consistently get GOOD shots off. Which was more on the ball than off, but he was definitely quality at both.  One of my favorite Mourinho quotes, I think it was his 1st season, 2nd stint at Chelsea, he's talking about how strong the city team is, and goes on to call Aguero a 'little tank', and I think he's spot on, Aguero had great balance for his size and would always have just enough space due to his agility/acceleration that he'd be difficult to put off. That and he could blast it in from anywhere it felt like. Idk.. maybe I'm wrong but that's my feeling.  Could be recency bias but Haaland really appears to have top football IQ, Aguero was very good in this regard also, time will tell with Haaland but you can see his efforts with his runs or looking for pass, it's hard to fault his decisions most of the time which is actually kinda refreshing",KDB is just on a different level tbh,

Ultimately that’s why Grealish and mahrez need to step up. Our defence hasn’t been very solid all season. I don’t know what it is, but I hope post World Cup we start being our dominant selves again.

It just so happened that the three positions that are vital for this new shape were occupied by rusty players and fellas that are not well-practiced in the system for match situations. It also didn't help that we had Rodri playing at CB during our defensive phases, which really left us empty in the middle. We were extremely fortunate that Raheem pulled his hammy that early on, because I suspect Chelsea having an extra outlet along with Pulisic would've resulted in them scoring a goal in that first half...

Constantly blaming Pep, ripping into players who don't deserve it. Just feed directly into media narratives and then go on to make their own in their mind.

Did we play well today? Not particularly. Did we play bad today? No. We had a couple of individual errors that led to chances and struggled to break down a block of players that only had interest in kicking us.

The referee was desperate and I'm honestly so sick of the inconsistency and playing a meta games the refs do. Romero needed to go around the 70th minute when he brought down Grealish. But the ref let him away with it because he held his head. The commentators knew it, everyone knew it but the referee's either stupid or a bottler. He constantly got fouls wrong, corners wrong - the Rodri collision was a penalty. Fair enough to say the the collision with his first hand 'wasn't enough' but the follow through has to make it one. We seen it in the world cup. But nothing ever carries on from the world cup even though FIFA write the rule book. You see it in the added time as well. Spurs wasted 3 and a half minutes of the last five alone. And we ended up with 5 added on. Which they wasted half of. Joke.

We have fullback issue. Cancelo has lost it and it will be same throughout the season. He is tired and has concentration issues and he isn't getting rest. 

Stones at RB is tragedy. Spineless performance today. 
. We don't have fullbacks and Pep isn't using Lewis or JWE Or  Gomez. They can't do worse than Stones and Cancelo

Gundogan was all over today. If he did basics right we would have created chances to score. 

Kevin haa been off but his individual brilliance has rise to different levels. He has magic to change game in seconds. Today he was extra garbage ans his magic didn't come. Has enough enough credit to his name which last his entire city career but today was the worst show ever in City shirt .

The Negative outlook; Massively damaging defeat.

All my blame is on Pep tbh. I lost a lot of confidence when I saw the lineup, there are games to try out a never before used lineup, away to Tottenham isn't one of them. 

Tottenham didn't do anything new or different to what they've been doing the past 5 years against us. Yet Pep still can't figure out how to prepare the team for this game, even with 9 days to prepare.

I said in pre-match that it didn't matter who their manager was, and today proved it because they didn't even have Conte. Losing all 6 matches away to Tottenham without scoring is embarrassing. 

Huge blow in the title ""race"" if you can call it that. Arsenal finally lose a game and we let them get away with it, still 8 points behind.

Arsenal came here 3 weeks ago and comfortably won. In fact Tottenham had lost 4 of their last 5 home league games (even Liverpool won away here for crying out loud.) Yet again though we flopped here.

3 away defeats in a row and we go to Arsenal and Leipzig very soon, things could get ugly. 

The only player that can hold their head high today is Grealish, was the only one who didn't look scared and complacent. Actually tried to make things happen.","The offside goal speaks for itself.

That's football, upset happens.",,"The reffing was the poorest we have experienced this season. That game should never end at 102. The FA claimed they'll take out all the fluff of time wasting but they encourage it by not adding time to the game. 

Kevin had a bad game generally but he is not the reason we dropped points. The reason we dropped points is the same reason we lost to Liverpool. It is Pep Guardiola.

There is absolutely no reason to make subs late. We did not beat Brentford playing the same way why was it going to work today? Just make the subs early as the new players need time to get into the flow of the game. He keeps talking about rhythm but then coaches like he does not know about it.

It has been a very shambolic past few games for us even before Brentford. We did not play well against BHA and Fulham.

I was probably histrionical by saying the league was over but the performances and Pep are why some of us feel that way. We are just not ruthless and dynamic enough.

I feel worse about the Chelsea and United games because we are making them believe and this is not fair to us - the fans. We will take bad results but not bad effort or overthinking - every single time from Pep. Just make the subs. We all watched the WC. Deschamps reacted quickly and it almost won him another WC.

Pep is the best because he incorporates the future into every present decision but he has to coach the game infront of him from time to time. Like try to win that game infront of you and stop thinking about other games that will not matter if you lose.

Truth is, we need BHA to beat Arsenal today or at least get a draw. Other than that, we will somehow find a way to drop points to Chelsea and United which will keep Arsenal's lead safe.

we were poor but Newcastle was even worse",I think mikel missed a trick today. Saka should have gone against bernardo more but overall we just lacked the mentality to win this game. 2 big mistakes in a game of this magnitude shows the inexperience of a title chase.

The tactics for most of the match were completely off. 

By having Lewis drift in centrally space was way too condensed in the middle and Graelish and Mahrez were isolated outside. Spurs were able to stay compact and squeeze down what little space there was and deny service to Haaland.

The inability to break the lines and make spurs turn was the biggest issue. It seemed like Pep was too concerned about losing possession and allowing Spurs to counter. 

Laporte and KDB were needed with their ability to break the lines, especially KDB’s ability there and find Haaland",Bullshit win for United.

Pep had clearly seen something in our last games with them and adjusted, not sure it'll be a regular thing, especially for walker he didn't look particularly comfortable in there. Rodri seems to have picked up right where he left off, motm. Agree about grealish/cancelo. It doesn't work cos both want to come inside on their right foot.

Kyle walker,  Cancelo,  Forden are on the bench and hardly playing why?

I like Mahrez but he has not done anything to warrant 3 starts and so much game time in a row.

Grealish,  I've given up on just continues to clown around.

Lewis is a very good prospect but walker and cancelo are not finished so I don't understand that at all.

The back 4 especially Ake and Stones who offer nothing going forward. 

My biggest frustration with Pep is his inability or just stubborn stance of pass pass pass football that is going nowhere. 

Fergie was not as talented a coach as Pep is with the football from Pep's teams just out of this world but his management skills to me are superior. 

11 added minutes at old Trafford against Everton and united not winning would have been unthinkable. 

He certainly would not have waited till the 84th to make his 1st change.

Unfortunately he doesn't seem like a fit in the machine like you said; I like Jack too, he's such a great locker room presence and I've always seem him as a ""glue"" man for the team. 

The inside city videos on YouTube really shows how he gets along with everyone and is just a joy to be around. I hope something clicks and it works out for him with City haha it could be wishful thinking.","This is going to sound pessimistic, but imo this is a realistic take on our scenario:

It’s going to be a longshot for us to win any major trophy this year. We have the beet team in the world, and Pep (who is admittedly the best itw) is simply not using the squad properly. Hes had so many chances over the months to figure it out, yet he continues to try things that will not work. 

Our tactics going forward are quite literally spineless. 

•All these technically gifted players on our squad and we are playing this slow sideways passing stuff. 

•Not playing Grealish after his best game in a City Uniform. 

•Not playing our only RW after he is just pickinng up his form

•Not using 5 subs when we dont play a match for 2 months

•Odd CB partnerships like Laporte and Akanji

Various decisions of this nature happen in every game where we struggle, but due to luck and individual quality of our players, we find a way to squeak out.

This will not last unless Pep starts to adapt/ concede that what he is trying isn’t working. But Based on the last few years, I really doubt that he will do that. 

Usually, games like we had against Fullham & Liverpool will shock a team to make changes going forward, but we have gone into every following game with the same toothless plan. 

We have the ability to conduct some of the most electric football in the world, but instead we play directly into the hands of any team that sits back.

Obviously from an outsiders view, there is probably something behind the scenes that may be influencing this that we dont see, but still it’s not hopeful. Of course i hope for the best, but I will not be shocked if we return from the world cup with the same exact problems that we have now.","Cancelo game today brought back memories of his poor game against Madrid second leg.

Hell, Messi would get pissed if he was subbed off at 80 minutes at 5-0 with him scoring all goals, cus he would want goal number 6!

Sigh.,"I am very surprised Laporte didn't play. I think he offers so much more going forward than Ake and the drop off defensively isn't that much. I wish Stones was fit because I think those two would have started (Stones and Laporte) 

It's clear Bernardo needs to move on. he's not bringing any energy anymore.  the passing today from him was atrocious. so many fucking turnovers. 

KDB needs to take some heat as well. yeah yeah I know he got the assist today but he also got dominated by shitty Fred all game. that is unacceptable for a player we say is the best in the PL and maybe the world. He's been very inconsistent/borderline bad for long stretches this season. for one of the captains of this team, he has to do better. 

Pep has GOT to find a way to make Haaland work... teams have figured out how to isolate him. It felt like City were playing with 10 men today... there is no movement or flow anymore... its just pass backwards a million times. who gives a fuck about 70% possession if you have one god damn shot on target??? and don't get me started on the constant giveaways (not a pep issue... but wow so awful)

Personally I've never thought Grealish is meant to be playing LW for us but unfortunately our midfield is way too stacked for him to play there. At Aston Villa he thrived by getting into spaces in the center of the pitch rather than always having to cut in from the wing.

>We don’t necessarily need them, but we’ve signed them anyways because they would definitely improve a rival .

By design, every good player that we've signed takes away the chance of a rival signing them, so this makes no sense unless, as I said, you're like United and are making it clear through your PR monkeys that this is the case.


>Why do you think we signed Grealish , Mahrez, Phillips, Akanji.

There have been reasons given quite publicly for signing all of them outside of the simplistic reason you've given, even if I personally haven't agreed with all of them. Also, adding Phillips and Akanji there is slightly disingenuous considering we needed a Rodri backup, and atleast 2 of our CBs at any given time are made of glass, hence the need for Akanji.

>Jude is the same.. we absolutely need him especially if Bernardo or Gundo walks next summer.

You do realize that other targets exist. Even if we don't get him, it's not the end of the world. Plus, if he's indeed going to cost an arm and a leg, then we might as well look at another target in addition to addressing our other needs at FB and possibly at the wings if they don't think Palmer is enough.","Pep dont fucking care about what you are talking. The only thing he cares is someone need to stay wide to provide the width, someone stay in the half space (Gundogan, De Bruyne, David Silva,... or an inside winger) and a striker in the center.

And he used Cancelo and Mendy and Zinchenko wide to play narrow winger a lot of time. Even in the match today there was multiple time Cancelo player higher up out wing for Grealish roam inside. They switch together a lot of time",My mind kept on going to that combined 11. What a joke,,,"Doesn't. He DID. Messi was involved in every play and ran with the ball all the time, and he got clipped down over and over and still got up and wanted to keep playing.",,I’d be more worried about grealish tbh,,,Haven't watched the gane but where did alvarez play?,"Little scary that we haven’t played a top 6 side yet, but these Newcastle and Palace sides are stronger than last years so it kinda makes sense.

When it was clear that he was Europe bound, I always talked with my friends about how he was exactly what Pep seeks in his forwards: Can play multiple positions, smart, huge motor, always pressing and clinical. When he signed for City I had biggest grin, and I'm a Boca fan lol",Lack of game time. Early in the season. Simple as. You don’t need a rocket scientist to figure that out,"Gotta have confidence in Ake, always knew he would work well here.",
181,Don't forget that we didn't have KDB,Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are the type of guy i mentioned above,I tried to gg the arsenal sub because I was genuinely impressed with them and how scared I got every time they had the ball. Got one response and it was about us breaking the ffp rules or whatever. Classy,"With his injuries and lack of ability that we’ve seen, he’s reminding me of Jack Rodwell… which is very bad.",,"What hope is even left that.

The way we conceded goal was just laughable. We overplayed it at the back, and we paid for it, and what's worse is that Spurs could've had more while we didn't even bother Lloris until the final whistle.

Haaland didn't have one SINGLE FUCKING TOUCH in the opposition box let alone a single shot on target all game.

That was a very, very frustrating and larthagic performance to watch. The 1st 15 mins were good, but we just tailed off after that, with exception to a few chances, especially the Mahrez shot hitting the bar but once that happened, I really had a bad feeling about the rest of the game and what's worst of all is that in the last 5 games including this one, we haven't even scored at Spurs. 

What Villa managed to do just a few games ago which is not only score but beat Tottenham at their stadium is what we, for some fucking reason, CANNOT do in a single premier league season year in, year out despite winning the league as we have, Champions everywhere else but at Spurs.

I can't even understand what the issue is now because there seems to be more than just one. we pass backward and sideways, and we contain possession only to recycle it again and again and again, not finding Haaland with exception to that partnership between KDB and Haaland, but what's the point even.

This team looks like it's not going anywhere good at the moment, and i can't even imagine what that Arsenal game will be like in about two weeks because if the Spurs game was abysmal then I don't even want to think about that one.

For as much as i wanted to believe, even after the Brentford game or the Everton one that we'd actually mount some sort of serious charge at some stage to put a good amount of pressure on Arsenal at the top,it's results like this that keep me in good doubt but for me, that could seriously be it for our titles chances or even winning anything this season because I'll ask this, does this team instill confidence in any of you that this team will still go on to win something this season, forget individual brillance or past experience for a second, that's irrelevant right now and be honest about it. I really haven't even been enjoying this team this season apart from Haaland to De Bruyne because I can't remember when we've actually played good, consistent, and dominant football that we've seen before. Yeah, we got great results like against United at home, for example, but those, in retrospect, look like blips of what we want to see rather than what we've actually seen since.

We aren't particularly enjoyable to watch and becoming rather easy to create chances against and easier to defend against for the opposition.

I'd rather just keep lowering my expectations at this rate because the UCL is just another heartbreak waiting to happen as it is every season.

I'm tired, I hate Spurs, and I don't know what else will even change after this, we just need to keep 2nd spot and at least finish better off than this but I don't even know about that.","This is a shitty time for too many players to be completely out of form, doesn’t help when the opposition is handed a massive assist.",They’re not wrong though. But they had help from Paul Stevie Wonder Tierney,Every one of our third kits is cursed we had madrid away in that hideous blue pyjama,,The good thing is 2022 and this match is going to be behind us.,We played a different formation first half and it's his first match in about a month.

But to have this many talented players sitting on our bench when they could easily be starting for a rival team? This is not a coincidence. 

Part of our transfer strategy involves denying our rivals of quality players in key positions. 

I wouldn’t put it past our management attention to detail that they are constantly analyzing our rivals and predicting who’d they sign to fill the gaps.

To the supporters group in Manchester. Do you have a line of communication with the club and can/have you all expressed your frustrations with the late substitutions and lack of service for Haaland?

&#x200B;

I think we all agree on those yea?",[removed],"WHAT A WIN!!!!!! 

RUBEN FUCKING DIAS!!!!! Oh my god why was he stuffed on the bench for so long in favor of Akanji??? I’m over him, sorry Akanji is lazy on defense and it’s costly. Dias needs to start every game the rest of the season unless he can’t. 

I’m happy for the Viking today. He scores on the road against a big 6 team to shut that narrative up. He’s continuing to improve in all aspects. I think he put some doubt in the minds of saliba and Gabriel. You can’t boss the big man around. 

Despite the refs losing control of the game and doing their best to fuck over City, We went into the Emirates and told them to fuck off. I don’t want to hear the excuses. Even without partey, the refs did all they could to keep Arsenal in the game. Arsenal also dominated City in possession which never happens. That was your chance. And you got beat by 2 goals. 

Despite how inconsistent this team has been, the crazy line ups, the drama behind the scenes, in the locker room, this team CAN WIN this league. We are Right there. Yes they have a game in hand, but we are gonna be on their asses the rest of the season. I’m seeing it now. 

Lets fucking go! CTID",Soon pep will get rid of that role and add another midfielder,,"I forgot Bernardo was playing today, Rodri a non-starter and Ake great; said as much in the match thread.

This is a match statistically we probably would have lost anyway, so trying out something different with the line up doesn't bother me as much. It's still painful and our performance was a lot poorer than expected. However good job by our defenders I think it could have been a worse score if they had not played as well. 

Thought Grealish was one of the only players with any belief out there and credit to him. 

Let's go again at villa.","Pep played Walker in midfield in the first half which is how they were easily countering. 2nd half, he was held back and yanited didn't get a  whiff. Until that goal.

Akanji had a pretty terrible performance by my estimation of it.,"I'd say KDB, Erling and Foden did decent today. Bernardo for me was excellent. The rest was underperforming, and i'm not blaming them either. Today i really thought we would play Akanji Right back. and Cancelo Left back. To not target James fucking Milner at that Right back spot was an instant mistake. However, the one goal we did concede was a personal mistake from Cancelo, who in my opinion was the worst player on that pitch tonight. His defensive capablities was extraordinary bad. But all in all, what i saw tonight from the boys was the very standard of what we could expect. The one guy to blame in my opinion, is Pep. His overthinking cost us this game. I just hope next time we buy a 100 million pound player that we actually start to use him of the bench at least. Very frustrating from Pep. Anyways, we look forward to the next game.","Think he’ll serve it in the cup game, at least that’s the info I saw floating around.","And yet, Chelsea and Liverpool last year had much deeper squads than we have currently, even if you want to argue that 2-3 of their absolute top-end talents aren't as good as ours. 🙄

You're kidding yourself if you think that it's as central to the strategy as you're trying to suggest it is. Otherwise, we would've spent the money required on all the top quality players we've missed out on over the years, in addition to the fact that we would've not let Sterling or Jesus go to local rival clubs so readily like we did, regardless of whether their contracts were expiring or not.

And also on Ake, are you conveniently omitting the fact that we needed to replace Otamendi in the squad as well as the 4th choice CB?

Either way, it's silly to think that this is such a central strategic initiative, especially with the manager that we have where we recruit mostly based on their technical level, rather than their all-round game.",,big 6 is gonna be a madness.

Completely agree, this was extremely noticeable last night. Obviously you still take him in any team against any opposition but outside of goals he offers near nothing, definitely aguero offered more in terms of build up, passing, holding up the ball, linking with midfield etc.

I know there are intangibles like occupying defenders to free up space for other attackers alongside his frankly ridiculous goal output but it does stand out as a feature of us with him in the squad.

203,"If City goes out in the R16 and they fail to win the League, does Pep have to go?",,"It wasn't a great performance by any stretch of the imagination and it will be folly for anyone to think that but it was a great result.

I have no idea what Pep is doing right now but he got away with it today. I honestly do not get why the back 4 is not Walker, Dias, Laporte and Ake.

The football is not flowing and to me it is because of all these weird decisions by Pep. If you told me that Pep would take off Mahrez and bring on Akanji I'd have told you to eff off but this is what happened.

I got no idea how that is a penalty was Ederson meant to disappear (Townsend takes the biscuit in being 1 of the worst colour commentators I have heard, thank goodness I had headphones on).

To call that penalty and Nketiah's studs showing tackle on Dias as a fair tackle just beggars belief.

Haaland was absolutely magnificent in his overall play and I am pleased he got a goal. I honestly do not care if his all round play is shite as his goal scoring feats are just ludicrous, it is actually hilarious.

He has 180 goals in 140 games at 22.

DeBruyne is the man and I keep saying this City need to find a way to always put KDB in situations where he can shoot or provide assists. Forget about defending. Barcelona did it for Messi for over 10 years and he did not have a bad career.

Speaking of the penalty I do not understand Ederson. I am left footed and 9 times out of 10 i will always play the penalty to my left ie keeper's right as it is the easiest side for a left footer.

Playing it to my right is so awkward and requires power. The fact that Ederson is left footed even makes it more puzzling that he dived to his left when facing a left footed Saka.

I was also puzzled by his time wasting even at 0-0 and he deservedly got a yellow.

&#x200B;

Great result but I am still not sold on the performances. Seasons gone by I'd have been confident that City would go on a long run of wins but not this 1 simply because of the way they are playing. How awful was Mahrez today after his shitshow of taking a penalty off Haaland on Sunday.

Officials have been pathetic and it is always a case of two wrongs making it right in their book as I am pretty sure that penalty would not have been awarded if not for the Brentford issue.

Ake and especially Dias were magnificent at the back. Rodri played well without been outstanding. Gundogan made up for a so so performance with a magnificent pass to Grealish, what great vision.

Grealish did well in the second half but I'd prefer if he takes on his mind and stop dribbling backwards, that infuriates me.

Fantastic result though and Arsenal couldn't afford to lose this game as we all know about their fragile mentality.

I think they are against Emery next who will definitely has a lot to prove to them, talk less of the king of shit housery Martinez.

If they do not win that then I fear for their top 4 finish","Bernardo gives Pep control, he picks him when we are playing a high level team that can hurt us on the break if we lose possession.

It's practically clockwork at this point, players tak 6-12 months to acclimate to Peps system. 

Mahrez, Cancelo, Rodri, Bernardo, all 'flops' in year 1.",Especially with our draws this season we'd have 100% drew United or Newcastle,,So true,"I agree for the most part. The Cancelo at RW was still an outlier. No matter what he was having to shuffle around due to playing Walker and Ake at full back he could've easily still played Mahrez. 

I think Bernardo was a little odd too. In both phases, possession and out of he is in the same position on paper. He sits next to Rodri in possession to make the double pivot and also sits in that same spot (albeit next to Gundogan now as Rodri has dropped to CB) in the 4-4-2. I think Asking Bernardo to just kind of...sit still and be a pinball machine didn't quite work. I think if anything that's what Gundogan should've been, but he doesn't work as hard defensively unfortunately. 

**In possession**  
Foden-Gundo-Haaland--KDB-Cancelo  
\---------------Rodri---Bernardo--------------  
\-----------Ake - Stones - Walker------------

**Out of possession**   
\--------------Haaland--KDB-------------------  
\--Foden--Gundo--Bernardo--Cancelo-  
\----Ake-----Rodri----Stones---Walker----

Should look something like that, with both Gundogan and Rodri dropping into the line behind them when we are put under pressure. But even Walker was getting further forward than Bernardo at times, it was strange.

224,"Pep is too afraid of counters and transitions right now. Sam Lee mentioned it in his article along with commenting that it's something we've seen before at the start of 20/21. Pep himself mentioned it today in his post match that we had to play controlled like we were in the first half in order to avoid transitions. He said we don't have players with pace besides Haaland and Walker that can defend fast transitions.

Because of the above concern, we end up packing up the center of the pitch and progressing the ball slowly so that we are positioned to defend a transition and as well the opposition has been forced deep so that they cannot quickly get at our defense if possession is turned over. I'm not sure what Pep has in mind in order to address this for the next few months. We haven't been able to find a balanced system with the current players that prevents us conceding too many goals on counters/transitions while not totally neutering our attacking play.

That sucks.

One of the most manufactured 1-0 Liverpool wins I've seen. I mean shit. 

He was letting everything in the game go, then VAR called foul only when we scored. Thiago went in two footed, off his feet and got away with it. I mean fuck the ref even blew up to deal with Klopp, but *only when we were on the attack.* 

Bad performance from us for sure. Liverpool at Anfield is always shithousery and they needed a lot of help today and got it. Cancelo was woeful, I don't know if it's because he was on the right or what but yeah, so bad. KDB was putting the balls in but Haaland rushed most stuff unfortunately. Bernardo was pretty great though and Foden never stopped trying. 

If there is a game in the season we're *meant* to drop, it's this one. So whatever. The crowd effects the ref as much as the players so it's always a slanted playing field there.

Funny to see Nunez be that bad though, he should've had a brace tbh. I don't think he would've even scored those in our team, Klopp.

The atmosphere makes us rush things, combined with how Liverpool can get away with fouls that's just always going to be hard to get a rhythm going.

A lot of ppl really like to hate on Gomez and Palmer here but I think they deserve at least 1 full game of PL.

Gomez is really not worse defensively than Rico or Cancelo and can offer good value by playing wide and having good crosses.

I also believe that Palmer has really big potential. I saw couple of his games in academy. While Mahrez has some excellent games like against spurs at home but he also ghosted A LOT of games this season and I believe Palmer is better at taking on defenders.

Another concerning thing is that Haaland really doesn't fit our play style and struggles to show up in matches where not everything is going well. He is excellent at finishing and positioning in the penalty area, he is also really good at making runs and counter attacking (which we rarely do) but he can't dribble, he is not good at playing in small spaces, he just can't create anything on his own. I really prefer to have Aguero/Alvarez/Jesus type of striker.

I see A LOT of changes happening this summer. All I want is going back to the basics. Playing 4-3-3 with overlapping fullbacks, having fast wingers that are really good at 1v1s and not rotating 5 players every game.

This would be my lineup for our next game.

The transfer fee is determined by two parties.  It is an arms-length transaction that is only partially dependent on the player's performance.  This is especially the case with Grealish.  It would be foolish to ignore that Grealish's transfer cost was incredibly inflated due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, his nationality and release clause.  Neither are within his control and therefore should not be considered part of his ""value"" evaluation.  Some of hypothesized the English tax can be as great as 20%.  Additionally, his release clause was essentially a request for ""fuck you"" money which City called AV on its bluff.

So, TL;DR, I think that if you are going evaluate Grealish against his transfer fee, it would be wise to first attempt to divine what  portion of that fee was actually tied to his performance and expected performance.",,"Just anything else but this.

I have no idea what's up with Foden, but maybe he would have had more joy against Emerson on the left flank.

We badly miss Sane. Our wing play currently consists of cutting inside and passing back to a defender, which is predictable. Perhaps Grealish would fare better if he was moved centrally. Pick up the ball and create. Right now, he is often stuck on the edge of pitch, trying to hold width. He always attracts opposition markers, so maybe spaces would open up for others centrally if he was playing there. Mahrez blowing hot and cold. Silva seems to have checked out mentally.

Our football right now lacks imagination. A little more directness and eagerness to play through balls for Haaland should at least be tried.

243,"Btw its not like we dont have players to sub in for the older guys. We have foden, julian, philips, rico. But pep never wants to take risks.

I'd really understand Haaland if he is thinking he joined the wrong team. Based on how we are making no use of him, honestly I kinda think that he has joined the wrong team.

Our midfield is soo slow, by the time we are ready to make a pass, the other team can rearrange their whole formation. Which is the fluid football that these guys played even last season gone?

Every city game I watch recently, it seems like we are going to lose. One positive game was vs arsenal where we had only 36% posession. I'd give up posession for goals. Teams like madrid, united are barely concerned about posession, but when they have the ball, they make things happen. For them the tactics is to always move forward, but we are so concerned about the posession that we barely make a forward pass. I also think we dont have enough risk takers in the team now. Foden and Julian are risk takers, and pep never uses them.

Us moving toward slow/boring football is definitely our downfall. Hopefully we'll get back on track soon.

I thought everybody was terrible passing and receiving the ball, and unfortunately he was a victim of some of his teammates fumbling their receptions. There were atleast 7-8 players who were much worse, and I have to say outside of Laporte, and 2 other players, everybody was really bad, including the subs (which is unusual). If anything, this game proved to everyone as to why Foden isn't trusted in midfield as much as we think he should be. I'll excuse Walker since he did as well as he could playing in an unfamiliar position, but I can't even let Phillips off the hook even though it was his first start, since he was also just as bad.

It may prove a blessing in disguise getting knocked out now since it's clear a lot of this second XI don't have the requisite consistency yet to perform once per week.

Then zinchenko midfielder turned LB, this aged well but Pep was far too reliant on a midfielder at LB and injury prone Mendy that he has til this day not signed a real left back that will once and for all solve this issue, then Fernandinho at CB in 19/20, instead of replacing Kompany goes and plays a defensive midfielder at CB to now realising that mistake and wanting to buy every CB in the transfer market 😂. 

Conclusion : Pep needs to stop playing so many players that can excel in midfield or are midfielders out of position and rely on them to deliver and instead just have the mentality he has in 17/18, 1.) study the league 2.) find out the winning formula for success 3.) sort out having a perfect game plan from now til the end of the season 4.) just be like how you were in 17/18 and 18/19 or 20/21",We're witnesses!,,,"The last game I remember us being genuinely good in was the Southampton game, that was over a month ago","I honestly think next time we score at Anfield the players should take a few seconds before celebrating - just don't play into VARs hands..

Well played to Ten Hag and the way United set up, but we did do well the 2nd half, but yeah, it just doesn't look to be turning around anytime soon because to pick up consistency to stay in the running is just not gonna happen.

We don't find Haaland when he makes his runs, De Bruyne is out of form even if he got an assist for that Jack header and how are we even going to set up for the rest of the season when it matters because there's still the UCL but you have to ask yourself how this team can switch mentally to not just get a goal but put a team down in order make sure they don't come back. 

Yes we played well in the 2nd half but man, we suck, we aren't playing well at all because we lack so much at the moment.

Walker making overlapping runs despite playing basically as part of a back 3 in the past, I wonder if Pep gave him more license to do so or if it was just Walker being over eager.

The difference in this game was it seemed like he was instructed to come inside alot as soon as he arrived at the penalty area, unlike the Anfield game, almost mimicking Mahrez's function. He can do it on the left, but it's a waste imo doing it on the right with him considering how he's historically succeeded as a RB/RW by being devastating on the outside and having a freer role. It is a bit concerning that Pep saw this as a viable option considering how badly it went against Liverpool. However, I don't think it's the end of Cancelo as the LB, as I think this was one of Pep's big-brained experimentations taking place in an actual match situation. We can't afford to shift Cancelo out of LB duties just yet considering Gomez still isn't trusted at all to take part in any significant matches.

I genuinely think Pep comically big-brained it in the first half by having Bernardo and Gundo helm the fort in midfield out of possession, considering Gundo's clear lack of dynamism which gave Bernardo too much to cover. I think in hindsight it would've looked better if we had Walker become the second CB to Stones which would've at least had Cancelo defend at RB and not have them look as confused as they did every time they defended the transition, which would've atleast left Rodri to defend in CM.",,,It's pretty shit of the FA to still have games going on tbh,"We got sucked into it..

> Honestly I think we will see more of Lewis, I think we've missed Gundogan playing as the left side interior when he's been missing this season and Cancelo (who kind of played in that position with Bernardo forming part of the double pivot last season) has looked poor. 

Yeah agreed. I love Lewis. Gundogan doesn't work hard enough defensively to drop next to Rodri I think, that's why Bernardo or an inverted fullback is now preferred.

Because in this game even in the defensive phase he wasn't at RB as you say.

It could've just been a big brain play. Usually with Pep those are always centered around stopping counter-attacks. And with Ake and Walker, I can see some logic too it, he just needed the rotation to come through the middle rather than the wings in this instance. 

I agree that Cancelo moving to RB and Bernie/Gundo shifting over would've worked better in our 4-4-2 though. Keeping Rodri in midfield and Walker at CB. 

But yeah, I assume Cancelo will play on the left again, but maybe after this he has a bit longer on the bench as he wasn't too great. It's a shame about Gomez, he's accomplished in possession but defensively has lapses and physically he seems not up to it from what I've seen. 

I don't know what the reasoning is but Wilson-Esbrand just seems out in the cold, no mention, no real sight of him.

Completely agree. It’ll be interesting to see for sure, I think the fact that Pep really wanted Cucurella suggests that he might still have plans involving conventional overlapping FB’s, there have been more moments this season where the wingers play a little narrower and I think that’s the narrow winger with someone overlapping is Grealish’s best position. Not exactly typical Pep but it would be nice to have the option.

Once he’s confident in us, the chains will come off",Go back to commenting on r/upskirt you degenerate,,Maybe score more than one goal? And not take the foot off the gas. This is on city and city only,">But yeah, I assume Cancelo will play on the left again, but maybe after this he has a bit longer on the bench as he wasn't too great.

Pep sounded apologetic and guilty about using Cancelo in that role in the match and having Rodri play at CB during the post match, so it'll be one of those rare instances where he'll take responsibility imo. As for Walker and Foden tho, I suspect he won't be viewing them as positively and a spell with the 2nd/Cup XI is on the cards for them both.

>I don't know what the reasoning is but Wilson-Esbrand just seems out in the cold, no mention, no real sight of him. I wonder if he's been a little raucous behind the scenes wanting to get game time and Pep has punished him for it? He was at least on the bench in 8 of our first 14 games.

He might've wrankled a few feathers in the coaching staff. But ultimately, I just don't think he's at the technical level where Pep will play him, which shows what we prioritize in players considering Gomez is ahead of him even despite all of his notable flaws.",,,once the plastics learn the sport,Awful performance from us and the scoreline flatters us even then.

The little drive forward early in the second half where he switched the ball between his feet and then poked it on to Haaland before getting taken out of it was really similar to what he does best. Note it was kind of an inside left position, not a winger position, he drove forward, drew players in and released it just before the defender could get to him and suddenly there was space everywhere. 

That’s his best attribute to me. People complain he holds it too long but often by the time he’s released it the ball is 30 yards further forward and 3 defenders have left the positions they should be in out of pure frustration and determination to nail him.

But against a back 5 and we need to commit another player forward and so become a 2-2-6 he's just not used to having the spaces between him and his other CB.

In their minds they know they have a cluster fuck of a season regardless of a World Cup,  but throw that in, and it’s not pretty. 

Also think Pep’s tactics have been exposed in the games we’ve lost points. His failures to adjust when City are down and clearly not clicking has hurt.

The last natural LB that consistently played for City is Aleksander Kolarov. For years we've had makeshift solutions like converting Zinchenko, Delph and Cancelo. It's not good enough. And on the right we basically have no one to rely on. Last season Walker was injured and Pep was forced to start Stones at RB in a CL semi final.

If another midfielder also drops deep there's less passing triangles further up the pitch if we do get out.

With Bernardo at LB, he can tuck into holding midfield and use his amazing ball control and dribbling to be a very effective out-ball for the defenders, so you have a line of 3 in defense and a line of 2 in defensive midfield in the build-up.

Sterling has a much wider skillset than him while being younger despite being a worse finisher.

Jesus is just a much better player overall. He's perfectly capable as a winger. Don't take that it's either or for Julian/Haaland and Jesus.

How much has the squad changed in the past year or so? Apart from Haaland 90% of the regular starters have been there for over a season.

I have followed Pep since he was a vastly underrated but completely world class  play maker at Barcelona then to his stint as a manager.

As great a coach and tactician that he is , he has this tendency of always trying to reinvent football.

When Barcelona beat United at Wembley to win cl, they were football nirvana, the best of the modern era by a long way.

What did he do the next season, he brought in Fabregas and Sanchez and Barcelona the next season were considerably worse.

David Villa was marginalised before he suffered a horrific injury at the world club cup. Fabregas was played as a false nine and it became more about possession than penetration.

Of course they were knocked out by Chelsea in cl, lost the league to a far more dynamic and counter attacking machine in Real Madrid.

At Bayern he decided the best right back in the world Lahm is better off as a midfielder.

You have a midfield of Kroos, Schweinsteigger,  Thiago, Alonso and Lahm. Sure there is technique and ability but no dynamism, athleticism or speed.

Similar to what is happening right now.

Are you going to play Silva at left back against Salah vs Liverpool; Rodrygo vs RM; Coman vs Bayern and these are  just the top of my head.

No mayne the biggest contributing factor to City's less than fluent play is all this unnecessary tinkering.",,,I reckon there’s a big spend coming in this next window,"There is nothing to be furious about because Oliver was smokin' joint in the VAR room. 

I laughed so hard when that goal was given. Insane.",,"I can see what you're saying. I feel like it's the balls in that are more the issue. I don't remember Erling missing many headers because they never actually get to his head? they generally get cut out by the CB in front of him. 

That and at least a couple goals of his that would be headers by any orthodox striker he jumps in the air and extends his leg where his head would be to score. 

But the general idea I agree. Against an organised defence we are not good at just chucking balls into the box for someone to head in. Which is why we cycle the play around so much, forcing the defence to shift over constantly until someone lags a little and space is created for someone to run into. 

We struggle against back 5s in general. Because it's even harder to open up those spaces and we have to commit more players forward to do so, which leaves our rest defence even thinner to counter-attacks. 

But this is the issue we're posed with. Pep and City have been so dominant teams are almost forced to sit back in these ultra defensive set-ups and just try and shut us out completely.   
I think one issue is that Pep doesn't want to get involved in transitions *at all*. Not only defensive ones but offensive too. He doesn't want us to spring counter-attacks much because they often end in a turnover, and we wouldn't be set up to defend another counter-attack so quickly.

It's not that at all.

It's the fact that he doesn't even offer himself as a proper target and challenge any of the CBs properly in a physical sense where the crossers can be confident in lasering good balls to him. There have actually been some good crosses that he should've met but hasn't because he takes up such poor positions in the box as he's either trying to avoid CBs, or doesn't gamble in the box enough and hangs back with the CBs instead. As a result, you're seeing quite a few times where he's missing the ball after a jump, and imo, that's due to the fact that he isn't taking up those good central positions where he's overpowering a CB and getting a leap, and instead taking those leaps in poor positions.

I mean I'm watching the video of all his goals in the prem this season right now.

Goal 3 - Set defence against Newcastle. Finds space, scores from close.  
Goal 4 - Set defence against Palace. Makes a run between the CBs, heads in.  
Goal 5 - Set defence against Palace. Ball is played along the floor to tap in.  
Goal 7 - Set defence against Forest. Just holds the CB off completely and taps the cross in.  
Goal 9 - Unorganized defence against Forest. But he scores a header brushing off the CB.  
Goal 12 - The corner against United. Just wins the header physically. 

Goals 4, 7, 12, maybe 9 I feel are exactly what you're saying he doesn't do. 

And his movement in the box against set defences to find the space got him goals 3, 5, 14, 15, 20.

Admittedly these are only the ones that have worked.

If we let in 1 goal we will let it 1-2 more. Our defence has sterling mentality. One thing goes wrong and it fucking falls apart in seconds.",,"He's not the problem in those situations because we're playing to his strengths where we're literally putting a ball on a dime (his second goal against Palace), or where he's scoring them off 2nd or 3rd phase set-piece situations (the Newcastle goal and the Forest goal). The one's where he scores by extending his legs are genuinely only unique to him, but you would think that it would be a complimentary method that is in addition to a more traditional way of scoring against lobbed crosses such as with headers.

If you watch the Brentford, Everton, Villa, and quite a few games where we've dropped points, where we aren't given the opportunity to create his ideal chances, then for better or worse he has to create those physical superiorities with those CBs so that he can create easy heading situations and show himself as a reliable target to cross into, especially with the uber-narrow and extremist level of conservativeness that we choose to play with. He's not the biggest problem obviously since the issue with our attacking is still due to the system we employ, but he's definitely imo not doing the best in those situations to make that style of play even slightly more easier to employ and alleviate even a slight bit of pressure.

I hate doing the ""if we had X player from the past"" thing, but in those scenarios specifically, I'm sure Dzeko would've scored much more in those situations and imo also cause himself into being a nuisance for CBs physically in order to win those aerials.

The point I'm making is that if we're going to bang our heads into the wall with this imo frankly counterintuitive way of attacking 5-man deep blocks, then Haaland has to do WAY better than he has in the air in these situations, as ultimately a nonsensical a situation as it is to put him in the grand scheme of things.",,"I feel we dint create enough chances but did you how deep they were sitting ?

That's exactly what I was saying though. That when we do get it to him accurately, he scores, the trouble has been getting it to him accurately. Not him scoring them.

>The one's where he scores by extending his legs are genuinely only unique to him

That's fine, no? personally I'm not really bothered what he uses to score in those situations as long as he does.

>then for better or worse he has to create those physical superiorities with those CBs so that he can create easy heading situations and show himself as a reliable target to cross into 

I feel like in those kind of games, we use our normal system of recycled possession to try and probe the defensive line. And it's only really when we get quite desperate that we will cross it, and rarely does it actually get to Haaland, it gets cut out, which again, I don't think is a Haaland issue. He can beat his CB 100% of the time, he's shown he can and has scored multiple goals this season doing it, but if the ball never gets to him, he can't score. 

I think part of the issue is that he's always in the box. Whilst it's the best place for him to score from, it's also the hardest place to get the ball to him. 

So if anything, I feel like if a team is sat really deep and organised, he should be dropping more often, into that 'zone 14' in front of the defence, because it's easier to get the ball to him there, he's pretty good at quick 1-2s and the defence has the issue of either mark the central space or move out to help stop Haaland getting the ball. Because he can shoot from there I feel. 

And that's where the danger will come from, if he drops a little deeper, and that forces the CBs to follow him, that's where gaps in the back line open up, that's where Gundogan, KDB can slip in and Haaland a couple times has shown he can play those quick passes through. 

For example, against a set defence we often turn up in this kind of shape  


https://preview.redd.it/oubsmv93zjba1.jpeg?width=459&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=578631dd0ac66bf17efcab70523080a00731104d

So in this situation it's just hard to get it to Haaland. He's covered by both CBs if crosses come in from either side, they have great zone coverage. What I think is if Haaland drops here, with the two 8s, we give them a serious problem because our 3 outnumber their 2 in midfield. 

Football in the modern era is so much about overloads. And one trick you can use is to abandon an area of the pitch they're marking to create overloads elsewhere. If Haaland drops, we outnumber their midfield 3-2 and we have KDB and Haaland potentially capable of shooting, depending how deep they are. So they have to sole this issue (or just take it and hope we don't score I guess, by having a CB move up to help mark Haaland and when that happens, a gap appears, that either of the 8s can slip into immediately. 

I personally think Haaland it phsyical enough, and has shown to out muscle CBs and score headers against a set defence. It's just hard to do it. In the games their CBs are performing well, or our crosses don't get to Haaland, I feel him dropping to cause this issue for their CBs marking nobody, and giving us a man advantage elsewhere, is how we force them to move.",,"I'm sorry but i don't subscribe to pep's apologist words on how wingers aren't supposed to create. You're the last man against one FB, literally in the box, how are you not holding the responsibility to do something from there? Just shutting down an entire zone of attack is not a successful role.

No matter what pep's tactics are in buildup, it's inevitable the scenario of a bus where width being creative/fast is required.

Play KDB in Grealish's role, isolated with a FB, he'd have even more chances created than todays two (or more i dont remember).

I think there's a slight miscommunication here. I mentioned that there have been crosses that most competent target men would make contact with and atleast get on target. And those aren't what I'd call pin-point crosses that I'm referring to here. Hence I mentioned the dime-piece cross (the CP 2nd goal), because that was the only time where the cross made the goal rather than anything that he did imo

>And it's only really when we get quite desperate that we will cross it, and rarely does it actually get to Haaland, it gets cut out, which again, I don't think is a Haaland issue.

It is a Haaland issue to an extent because he doesn't get at the end of those merely good or okay crosses as he's not trying to engage with the CBs in those tussles and outbattle them in those central areas within the scope of the goalmouth. As a result he ends up getting ahead of the trajectory of the ball by going near post in order to get away from the CBs, which is why there's been a few instances this season, including today where he jumps and misses the cross. He might have a better chance of getting the header for example had he given himself the opportunity to compete with the headers aerially by engaging in the central areas where they're targeted. But they essentially always hit the CB because he's hardly competing for those aerials properly, which is why we get the impression that our crosses are bad. This was the exact issue last season, but that was mainly because of the lack of height by the false 9 and Gabby. But in this instance, from what I've seen, Haaland imo isn't doing nearly as much as he should in those specific considering all his physical traits.

A majority of good target man play that I've seen isn't to do with impeccable delivery from the crosses, but rather from merely good, or okay crosses being put in and a striker battling for that space to get the header by either outleaping or physically bullying the CB. Otherwise, by the logic that you're providing, Aguero or any short striker should've been impeccable in the air. We've put in imo, okay to good crosses in those situations against a 5 atb, contrary to what everybody thinks, it's just that he's not adapted to that specific scenario well is all due to what I've mentioned above. 

FWIW, I'm irritated by Pep that we're using him so simplistically in the first place, considering his back-to-goal play in and around the penalty area is really underrated. I get that his link up play deeper in the pitch isn't up to the level for Pep's standards, but surely he's shown in a couple of instances this season that atleast against a back 7 he can more than hold his own and drop off once our possession is around the opposition's penalty area. There's also another thing, where I don't think we're utilizing his play around the wings at all, which is a big miss, considering this was something that he did quite a bit in Dortmund. I remember a specific instance where he specifically did the rare thing of drifting out left after we had manipulated the space out there against Everton's low block and absolutely rinsed the CB on the outside and managed to put a decent cross in. 

The tactic of him being in a gilded cage around the box works if the quality is there out wide, but as you've mentioned, it's not all that great in terms of the non-crossing incisiveness such as through the combination plays, dribbles and final passes. This is moreso with Grealish on the left, and Mahrez is erratic to the extent where there's no guarantee that he'll be playing like he has in the last few games all the time where you atleast get the dribbles and final passes. You could theoretically have Foden do his mostly successful Sane impression that's served him well, but even that seems to have been neutered due to Pep's instruction to have him ape Grealish's function on that side.",,Liverpool were 9 points behind us this time last year with Chelsea ahead of them!

No way Sterling would've outplayed him,,,Rico didn't have a good game but why u acting like he hasn't been one of our only consistent players before this?,"Challenging the ball is interference, Rashford run to it.

If Rashford stopped and Akanji noticed Fernandes running towards the ball, he should've went or a slide at worst.

Rashford running over the ball and faking a shot made walker look at him and not notice Fernandes, Ederson also went out of position.

The rules of interference are if the offensive player challenges the ball, blocks vision or access to the ball from the other players, or acts like if he's making a pass or a shot that influence the other team players decisions.",,,,"Less games, but we're falling behind. At this rate, we're hoping Arsenal drops points more than us gaining them.",,,,"I mean, we beat them last season because Sterling was able to stretch them and cause havoc off ball qualities and his speed.

Full back's only one issue. But the fact we're slow on the wings outside of Haaland is very concerning. Also, that a 3-5 at the back has become a template to play us against is extremely concerning. You never want to be a team where you can be easily nullified so simplistically.",Definitely not always buddy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
417,They showed it on BT Sport coverage,,"Tbf, Sterling is at his best with a great striker alongside him. Played his best for us with Aguero, he's great for England with Kane.

That rule really needs to be redone so that goals like this won’t count. I’m a MU fan and while I’m glad the goal counted I know i would react the same as city fans if it happened against MU. The rule really needs to be changed so goals like this don’t happen.,,,,There were two stops for the ref.,,,,"Bernado should play midfield because that's his best position no doubt about it and playing stones rb can't always work and yes, there's only so many times De Bruyne can play a killer pass for a goal or score an absolute worldie like he did against Brighton a few weeks ago.

Why would the Prem risk hurting one of its biggest clubs if they weren’t SURE that they had an air tight case? Remember, they already got you once.

419,"he's dying sooner than I thought he would. Pep should really give him the Bournemouth game off, but he won't.",,"> And why do they need to play in midfield?

Because one of the more constant things over the past few seasons has been building up with 3 ATB. Playing a more conventional 4 with Walker and Ake would represent *more* tinkering seeing as we have barely played with 2 conventional fullbacks during Pep’s tenure. Furthermore they are both pretty limited technically/going forward (which is why they look a lot better as part of a back 3). Zinchenko/Jesus/Sterling/Cancelo all leaving along with playing with a number 9 most games is a pretty significant change. There is no clear lineup/approach that has been clearly working that Pep is departing from, I think it’s a far more comprehensive/complex issue than you’re making it out to be.",,,Really? I thought he did well when he came on,"> Is it just me 

are you serious?",,,,"Which would mean occupying KDBs position. There's a reason foden is booted to wing too. KDB is the best midfielder itw, bernardo is 2nd.

421,Not exactly a seamless process. He can drop deeper to just get a touch on the ball but to be able play like a #10 like Alvarez isn’t something he can pick up in one season.

A lackluster Dortmund side utilized him better.

I’d be fuming if nobody would pass me the ball tho either",Impossible not with that work ethic lol 🤣,,,,Because we had 75% possession and only managed 3 shots on target. That’s why we are upset. It’s not good enough for one of the best clubs in the world,,,,"I’m lost on your point due to principle. We played and won trophies without a striker, using one of our best wingers as a target man while using midfielders as winger, and the same defense system you’re seeing now. For years. We’ve lost two games this season. Mahrez exists as a proper winger and still gets dropped over Bernardo from time. Moreover, the need for a winger depends on your formation. Admittedly, can’t speak to this match because I didn’t see it but our attack overlaps enough that it’s not really a problem. Nevermind that we have players out of their natural position that slide into massive sides playing there. Foden left wing would bench maaaaany a competitive side. 

If nothing I’ve said reaches you, just look at the trophies case the last few years. Would a winger make us better, probably. Do we need one, I’d say so. Will that make or break us, I’d think not. We had the best striker in the world atm and the best midfielder in front of the Brentford goal and the midfielder playing wing scored.",Think this is totally fair. We lost because Liverpool played slightly better than us when it mattered but we didn’t play terribly and we can’t win every game.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
425,Feel like cancelo was just the tip of the iceberg as well icl. Call me superstitious but I feel our players literally stare at haaland and still pass to someone else.,,I believe that Foden was big reason Haaland came here.  Foden is why I became a soccer fan again.,,,I agree with everything you said especially on Rico. He's not quite there yet and his inclusion feels forced. I think one of the biggest problems this team has is the backline and it's affecting the rest of the team.

Like, come on bro. I know your biased but it's quite clear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
426,Has to be - something isn’t adding up here,,Because they’re money hungry bastards who absolutely hate us,,,"I’ll push back on this. A striker of Haalands quality should demand the ball how he sees fit. It’s clear the preference is through balls or balls over the top, but we’ve destroyed our counter attacks. KDB used to break on the counter with wingers and the striker in front, now it’s only Haaland. It’s quite limiting. To me, the players on the ball the longest are playing the most conservative and stifling quick forward play. If the ball gets to Haaland, sure those things like his first touch, strength in the air can be things to work on. But it’s far more damning that our midfield right now is neither creative nor industrious off the ball.","Bernardo looks so disinterested, may as well get the Barca deal done now",,,,"Genuinely curious about this, someone told me alvarez played at the wing sometimes at his old club.

Madrid maybe,,,,Gotta have Ruben in there too.,"I vehemently disagree about him being out of position. Cancelo’s strongest position before joining City was RWB.

More likely teams are to roll over to us than arsenal lol,,,,"Goretzka, I knew I was missing someone obvious. Does Musiala also play centrally?","He did. Cancelo is a LB. I cannot remember the last time he played RB that we did not collapse. Add Madrid at Santiago to the list.

He is not a RB because defensively on that right he is always caught napping and in attack he is 1-dimensional. When he is on the left however, nobody comes close. He would have decimated Milner all game. 

We did not need to play Gundogan, Bernardo and KdB. Bernardo should have been paired with Rodri and KdB should have roamed. The game was crying for a right footed player like Grealish on the left and Foden on the right.

I can take a loss when we play like who we are but when the manager alters the team and we play badly yet he refuses to adjust it. It hurts even more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,"Oh, good to know that no one understands him then, we all thought that everyone saw him as a God in your club, and we didn't understand why

Thank you for your answer, have a good day",,,,,Your reaction is equally ridiculous.,Yep literally says if the player blocks the opponent,,,,Arsenal just forces teams to play like this. They play like City used to seasons before.,,,,"I just hope he will, I’m not sure but I like to be positive. He is one of the best coaches in the world","I saw that too. Cancelo being on the right didn't make much sense to me. 

Cancelo was barely hanging on back there. Scousers should have scored two more. They had two 3 v 1's but Darwin messed both of them up. That's the only pleasure I took from the game. 

Honestly, I think Pep loses his head in these games. He tries to be clever but when it doesn't work he should immediately go to his bench. He should have moved Foden to the right for Grealish. At least Jack could have just drove on Gomez and forced him to make a decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
451,Well i cant belive im saying this but im agree. Our team dont even have a LB or winger. Fuck Txiki,,,,,idiot,"CTID, hard done by, but we never give up. There will be fire in our bellies now.",,,,Only 30 games 8 more to go. It's surprising people are actually not seeing our problems. We are slow and old side as compared to arsenal. We had Sane Sterling at one point now we have Mahrez and Grealish. No pace with fullbacks and wingers,,,,"Agreed. Sorry for any confusion. Like I said below in another comment, 90% effort in Pep system doesn't win matches.

John Stones CB is great. RB sucks",He was worse in that game we lost against united the seasons we played the champions league final. Seems to have stinkers in big games from time to time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,"And what does Grealish offer other then going inside then backwards and passing sideways?

Naa thanks, Foden all day.",,,,,His one dimension is more than enough. Not his fault the rest of the team can't string simple passes together,"We didn’t get robbed, we were dreadful, lucky it wasn’t 4-1.",,,,"If Arsenal win tonight, they're 7 points ahead and we're yet to face them once. They have to go to Spurs' stadium, Anfield, St. James' Park amongst others.

[Do you really need a reminder? I feel like after the drama against Villa on the final day, you shouldn't but here you go](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FlUoBVfX0AEB5ht?format=png&name=900x900)",,,,"*When his team needed him*. Brentford isn't a big team either, but he goes missing when things go south.",He got put in in the 89th minute. Why not earlier I’ll never know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,especially when we counter attack he holds the ball way too long. it's like he is always looking for a foul. this is kind of player you want to sub a to hold on the score line,,,,,"We knew when we got him, not his fucking fault.",Never count on Tottenham,,,,"We havent had a top winger since leroy sane dammit. Grealish is so ordinary I dont get it. How on earth is he gonna be show us something extraordinary?! The answer is he isnt, I still do not see that 'something' in him like in bernardo silva when he joined or leroy sane. Playing 'neat' football and not losing the fucking ball etc is not enough! That is just expected when you play at at premier league club.",,,,i mean he isn't the type of player to go on and dribble 5 players and score. he needs to be provided the chances to score,Lots of 'leccy meters going wanting tonight,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
454,"I didn't say I was hoping for a draw. I said I would have taken a draw. Two very different things. I hope city win every game, but only the most entitled people would expect us to. In the CL away from home a draw is not a terrible result, and RB Leipzig are not a terrible side. So while I'd hope to win, I'll take it as a standalone result.",,,,,He actually isn’t. Problem is we’re not using all his dimensions at all. When was the last time we played a through ball to him? By the time we played one into the space behind it 90 minutes had gone and he had stopped trying those kind of runs.,Same and now my day is looking pretty bleak thanks to the absolutely atrocious officiating.,,,,"That’s hilarious 

Seeing him slip like that just showed how it wouldn’t go our way",,,,,Darwin “The Prodigal Son whose better than Haaland according to every fucking Liverpool commentator and supporter” Nunez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
455,"Guessing Pep feared we'd be unable to stop Leipzig on the counter if we tried to turn the game into end-to-end football, instead resorting to the attempt at patient and controlled play",,,,,Haaland’s a goal machine. Every team in the world would have him in their starting 11. If we can’t find a pass to a man who will make runs for 90 minutes it’s hardly his fault.,Akanji does not seem truly a top tier CB. Always thought he was brought to be cover. He has lapses in concentration too often.,,,,"We were the better team today by a mile, just got unlucky in the end and conceded a goal on the only chance they had (which as I mentioned was a banger of goal), also it's pretty difficult to score when they defend with 10-0-0 the whole game.. we don't have fast wingers to exploit them on the counters and the only one with the ability to dribble in tight spaces was in the bench for almost the entire game

&#x200B;

City still have to face Arsenal twice this season, If they manage to win both games there is hope",,,,,Bernie was on his bullshit today and I fucking loved it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
456,What about the 3 chances vs forest ?,,,,,"He is. He's the best one dimensional striker in the world. He needs passes through to him, he goes on runs but the ball then goes back or to the side.","To be fair, he had just blocked the first cross with his face. He needed Ederson or Cancelo to talk to him as Rashford was behind him.",,,,Agreed. Love him but man he can make some bad decisions sometimes,,,,,"It’s the same old same old at Anfield. They commit about 20 bookable offenses and only get carded after the 80th minute. VAR rules unfairly against us, and they get a lucky goal. Neutrals will rightly point out that they were shit and didn’t deserve anything, but the press will eat it up and act like Liverpool are the 1970 Brazil team.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,Ederson should have kept hold of the ball in the first place,,,,,Not being played at all. You want the man to just summon the ball?,Not for the most major,,,,Very direct and raw on the wing from what I remember. I'd rather him at striker on playing behind erling,,,,,This Is what lost us the game essentially. Cancelo is defensively often a liability. Criminal to leave him as last man,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
458,Yeah he was fine but he was 100% the reason we conceded. Any other goalkeeper sets up quicker and gets to that cross,,,,,In the right areas but our players loves to keep the ball,There was about 3 clear pens I saw not given. Haaland gets kicked in the fucking leg but no pen? Come on.,,,,He’d probably be better than grealish on the wing,,,,,">how bad is Nuñez tho?

Silver linings, amirite? Lmao. You could just see how much he wanted it and the pressure got to him. 

Even when he's having an off day, Haaland still shows up and gets some good chances on goal. Given nothing, he still manages to make _something_ of it. And in this case, props to Allison for stopping him from scoring. This time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
459,"That’s why being the goalkeeper is the hardest job. He didn’t make any amazing saves, he made saves which a professional goalkeeper is expected to save. The goal we conceded is entirely his fault. He switched off after a good save from a corner and his positioning was shit.

So many times this season he has let in saveable shots. It’s not good enough",,,,,"I don't blame him at all, The players around him don't play the passes into his runs at all, it's only De Bruyne who tries.",Casemiro got away with murder today.,,,,[deleted],,,,,Cancelo played that side because we don't have another single soul who is healthy who can play RB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
460,"He was awful til the world cup so I get people cheering him on for every little thing but this is the bare minimum you expect from a city player, one of the highest earners at that. He slows the game down so much that it ruins how we play completely. He can't take his fullbacks on, overhits passes and rarely scores. We have zero threat from that side.",,,,,Walker was fine.,And bringing down Mahrez at the edge of the box. The commentators were like “uhhhh yeah that’s a pretty blatant foul he got away with.”,,,,"They're so bad we're happy when they've at last created one goal in comparison. 

Sane was competing with KDB for assists, y'all. 19. That's what wingers do against buses. Not pass back and draw foul in pointless positions.",,,,,"Man that's so true, Grealish has played brilliantly recently, he must be gutted not to be called up for big games like that - can't be a good confidence builder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,"that was my best plastic american impression, i'm sorry :(",,,,,Rodri made the mistake,"We actually defended really well, thought the whole back 4 did good. But yeah you can't help their heads dropping after that ref decision - utter shite.",,,,Did I say that?,,,,,What was the overthinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,im glad you think its good enough to be pasta,,,,,"What game were you watching lol. Walks was amazing. Still absolutely rapid. 

Rodri was the one with the costly mistake.","Yeah, perhaps if Mahrez came off for Alvarez because he has that work rate to put pressure on the front line.",,,,"jack still is shit tho and he showed that today, was basically a waste when he had the ball",,,,,So how do you explain KDB's positioning then if Pep didn't change the system?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,Exactly. I don’t know how mahrez played the entire game .Saturday foden created loads of chances and was good. Alvarez has never had a bad game with us and is a World Cup winner. I will never understand why pep doesn’t play Alvarez or Foden.,,,,,😂😂😂this team squad is not winning a UCL. Couldn’t do it last year or the year before absolutely no way it happens this year.,It's the hope that kills at this rate.,,,,"This is true but this season our performances are underwelming to say the least. Haaland is literally carrying us, whole defence is shit show. If you can't win against Brentford and Everton at home then i don't have anything to say. It will be very tough, im not straight out saying its impossible.",,,,,"I wouldn’t say this is how we’ve been setting up all season. We’ve been using inverted right back systems instead of wide and high right back systems. Cancelo has had more LB appearances than RB. Definitely not our most frequent system of the season. 

We were playing 4-5 up high, which is something we’ve done often. But typically only with a midfield bolstered by an inverted wing back and Rodri. The right side of the pitch just felt and looked off all game. 

Regardless, we had lots of chances and corners. Should’ve put more than the one (disallowed by VAR) away. They were putting so many on Haaland that our wingers needed to be played into the box more. But Cancelo isn’t going to cut in from the right and shoot. And Foden wasn’t cutting in to attack either, despite him having a good game in my opinion. I would’ve like to see Mahrez or Grealish come in and drop cancelo back a bit. I think either of them could’ve created problems. Game plan seemed obvious to get crosses in to Haaland. But they had those covered all game.

Edit: grammar",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Putting one goal past this dreadful Everton side at home is inexcusable,,,,,??? Klopp was sent off and Liverpool picked up a bunch of cards.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
466,Do you think it is because playing with Haaland is like having 1 less player on the pitch in certain phases of play under Peps system? I read some stat where he is hardly touching the ball most games. Or is it a lack of fast wingers etc. I am sure Pep will eventually work it out.,,,,,Dude really thought he did something here. Like Spuds haven’t toiled in mediocrity as far back as anyone can remember,It’s United Refs are their friends,,,,"sane/sterling used to have 10-15 assists and sometimes even competed with kdb. grealish occupies the same space on the pitch & has dropped our standards so down we're happy with a non terrible game, 2nd year in.",,,,,I've just had a look at what Liverpool fans are saying on here and a few are saying haaland should of got a straight red card for taking the ball out of Alisson's hands coz it could of caused a career ending injury like fuck he was entitled to go for it coz alisson was not in control of it thats why VAR said it was fine this is how sad they are some of em said we actually don't care if we draw wednesday as long as they beat us how low is there optimism thats exactly why they've onlywon the premier league once in 30 years sad cunts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,"He's not even slow, I can't explain it. Like the Villa goal the other week, I expect him to come across and tackle Watkins and he just doesn't. He wanders over and does nothing

I'm not saying the league is indefinitely over but man, if we don't address our problems then it's gonna be a long rest of the season.

I miss Sane and Sterling because we were deadly back then especially on the break.",,,,,"bro is so mad that city can’t beat Liverpool😭😭 I’m a red and my god was that a good way to welcome haaland to anfield. just accept that your team can slip up. You’ve played teams that park the bus before and still won 4-0, it’s never stopped you. You couldn’t score against us and we could score against you, so we take 3 points (not that it means much for us, we’re out of the title), just upsets me to see city fans reacting like this. You guys even had more possession💀parking the bus is a lame excuse",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
469,Think you've hit something there but not on pep leaving. The assistant coaches seem to be hugely important and losing them clearly impacts style and largely player attitudes (cancelo was kept level/grounded by the last one but he left and cancelos relationship broke down),,,,,"dude its just bad. Lack of pace, the passing seems lifeless and not creative, seems like dudes arent taking chances pinging the ball up the field. I dont get it. Whatever this is its not working. Can we go back to how we played at the beginning of the season before the WC please","We looked a bit better yes. 1 shot on target in the past 2 games is atrocious though and tbh KDB, silva and Foden need a huge wake up call they’ve simply not been good enough. The only positives from today I thought were Grealish and cancelo",,,,"Of course I don't need reminding but this team lacks creativity at times and we make defensive mistakes when we shouldn't but everyone just says ""it's only January"" or "" Arsenal will slip up"", man I'm tired and maybe it's just me frustrated right now with the fact that we dropped off in momentum and didn't do much in terms of creating chances afterwards because that Gray goal was coming and he can score those which he did today.

Yeah, the good part is that Arsenal still have tough places to go to but thay depends on how close we are to then when they do so we can capitalize and even then, we do win a game without conceding from one shot on target. They don't drop points against the likes of Everton, who lost to the likes of Bournemouth.

This Mahrez- Grealish combo doesn't work anymore because we're too predictable and slow.",,,,,"ugh thats the worst part about today. because we ALL KNOW he's gonna do the same thing if we make it that far again this year. 

Just play the fucking best line up and system and fuck what the opposition does. Make them afraid of us. stop respecting them with these dumb ass tweeks. just fucking play the best 4-3-3 because that is where City plays the best. end rant lol",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
470,"They are definitely playing well.

I imagine different players respond differently to the physical & emotional tolls of the World Cup, and digging into the actual minutes for each player might give some more clues?   
Perhaps the WC was the tipping point for adjustment cracks that were already beginning to show before WC while for MU they have been able to build on the momentum they had before WC?   
What are your thoughts on why MC is not at its best?",,,,,All those Dyche post are proper embarrassing. Some people on this sub must have the memory of a goodfish posting shit like that before we go AWAY to spurs.,He made so many runs today but no one was attempting a ball through to him.,,,,Facts,,,,,And people are here defending him.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
471,"What's the ""new system""?",,,,,100%. They had great chemistry leading up to Foden's benchings prior to the WC.,"We can't keep playing long balls and through balls, we'll just give away possession cheaply. He needs to start to link play more and just not be playing on the shoulder looking for balls into the channels.",,,,"The funny thing is all of his long passes and crosses were the usual sublime passes.

It was everything else which he was stinking up unfortunately.

Also, Pep had an absolute stinker with the subs bringing them on so late.",,,,,"I think the aggro is coming for  the fact that we had a goal disallowed from a foul that happened about 75 seconds before the goal, and arguably didn’t even have any bearing in to the fact that we scored from it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s been a long time since he played RW (excluding Forrest, didn’t even play that good either) but he was pretty terrible and pep had no choice but to stop playing him. Foden has a lot of shocker performances and I promise if Mahrez had half as many bad games as Foden he wouldn’t be in the club anymore.

It's been a problem for a LONG time. one bad call today does't change the last like 3 months. No leadership, no chance creation. Where the fuck is the midfield? Looked like playing with 10 men out there... cause no one can get the ball to the best striker in the world...",,,,"I think its ok to be unhappy with only 3 shots on target, especially considering the possession.

All of our players seem disoriented and sloppy because we now have a focal point to our attack. Whereas last season, when there was no focal point, everything was easier. This makes no sense. 

Haaland makes a run ? Just give him the ball. There's one less man in the middle ? Play Haaland as a False 9. Or play Alvarez as a False 9 behind Haaland.",,,,[deleted],,,,,Can we get a ref press conference?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

479,I've felt that way for a while because things just don't seem to be coming together.,,,,,It means something when for the last couple of matches we've looked absolutely dreadful from kick off throughout the whole half - At least this match we started a lot more positively until we conceded that first goal.,I'm with you,,,,When a team is defending with 10 man behind the ball.

Don’t mistake me trying to add more nuance to your whining for me saying Grealish has performed well.  I’d compare him in regards to role most to Nasri or DSilva when on the wing. He hasn’t shown the same level of creativity either of them did. He has yet to really string consistently exciting performances at all, and as 100m player ofcourse that’s disappointing. But don’t pretend you perceive things pep doesn’t. Pep is doing his best with the tools he’s got. Grealish may well never come good in that role or any for mcfc. I for one support him and pep and hope it works out. I want more risks from the team in general, especially against vulnerable defenses like Everton. We gave them too much respect and beat ourselves.

Just last season with Liverpool breathing down our necks, we went away at Southampton and kept passing a thousand times among the defenders in a game where 3 points will have reduced some of the pressure. 

This isn't even the worst of this pass 100 thousand times to death football with no urgency to attack, I've seen worse.",,,,,"Ake at LB has worked. Not perfect, but it’s a whole lot better than using inverted fullbacks against teams who will wait for the counter and attack us out wide while we flail about transitioning to defense.",That's funny cos you seem to be focusing on the result and not the performance.,,,,"Realistically, I'm hoping for a win and a draw, but anything can happen, remember that they lost to the rags while we beat them 6-3.

Confusing how some of the quality we took for granted is missing yet all the players are still there.",,,,"yep too many grealish apologists, as if they never watched sane, kolarov down the wing actually troubling FBs..

yeah he was relatively less terrible but just think even with confidence, fundamentally he'll never be quick to be a winger or be able to chop onto his right to score like mahrez (who's 5 years older); stuff we need against parked buses. Not many teams will be naive like leeds playing open.",,,,,"Absolute passengers because their manager who should know better decides to play our best midfielder as a winger and plays a double pivot with Gundogan which we didn't need.

nah pep should keep him here cause he obvioulsy has plans for him and the squad isn't that big, even foden who's our starboy is being bench for jack who can't pass without hogging the ball",,,,,I disagree they created chances and even had a couple penalties but couldn’t finish.

I can bet it all on the point that Pep knows better but is being stubborn for some reason.,,,,,"I just can't comprehend how we all knew you couldn't have an inverted fullback and an inverted winger on the same side since the Sane days with Delph and Zinchenko. Now it seems he's lost all interest in Foden (not counting today) and keeps persisting with the slowest ""winger"" of all time who makes terrible fullbacks seem worldclass and still he doesn't buy a proper left back appropriate for this level while we have none.","Bruno’s goal was questionable but the tactics definitely weren’t anti-football. Shutting down the best player on the pitch isn’t chickenshit, it’s smart game management. It’s City’s own fault that they couldn’t find Haaland when he made so many great runs. United pressed high instead of letting City walk the ball into the goal, can’t be mad about that.",,,,,,,,,Harsh but fair. The most annoying thing is the ref letting those challenges go all game and then with VAR they look for any reason to not allow the goal. Its schizophrenic refereeing and if the ref deemed the challenge ok in real time you shouldn't be able to re-officiate it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,That explains it! Ffs,,,,,We’ve got to get some fucking pace in the transfer window for the summer. Leao should be top pickings by my estimate. We simply cannot continue the way we play currently if Haaland is in the team. Need to play more like we did in 17/18 and 18/19.,"Let’s be realistic here, we were a joke in the first half. It wasn’t anti-football to blame for our poorly placed passes, our defenders leaving holes everywhere. If we played a team with more effective forwards, we would’ve been ripped to bits, at least 2-0 in the first half.

However, United’s first goal was a farce, you’ve got to agree with that. The refs deciding Rashford didn’t interfere with play was seriously questionable, and I do believe if that goal remained disallowed, we would’ve likely won, maybe drawn.

Pep and his team have a huge task ahead of them. City have become incoherent everywhere on the pitch, and the last 2 games have really shown this. Obviously Stones and Dias being injured doesn’t help, but can’t be the whole problem either. Players are out of form and our chemistry isn’t ticking along like it used to. If we keep this up, we won’t come close to winning anything this season.",,,,,,,,,Pep said it best: you can't let the game flow by waving away anything soft then go in hard when a goal is scored. VAR is incompatible with the onfield referee deciding to be lenient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,"I highly suggest you to watch [this video](https://youtu.be/VWvsnHqSZZY)
You'll understand how we used to play. And contrary to the popular belief, that pep just buys good players and wins, will give you insight about how differently he plays every single season. He is constantly evolving the formation and tactics. In that video, you'll notice how little was the role of Agüero and Jesus (compared to the rest of the team). They were there to keep the CBs occupied, as Haaland is also doing so, and let the wingers or CMs score goals. At 14:35 in the video, you'll notice how we played at our worst in 4-2-3-1 and this is exactly the same way we are playing these days, although it's a bit different with Bernardo and Gundo being dynamic and having 3 CBs at the back to provide an extra man in the midfield. But it's not working as unlike the previous seasons when we had Zinchenko and Cancelo, we don't have fullbacks to provide crosses to our target man (Haaland). Furthermore, Sane, Sterling & Foden stayed wide in the wings, allowing Gundo and KDB to enter into the penalty area, but nowadays we have Mahrez who wants to enter into the penalty area and Grealish who wants to cut inside deep (Grealish suffered a lot in his first season because of this as Pep strictly wanted him to stay wide which was unnatural for him). 

TL;DR: While it is true that Haaland doesn't provide enough touches as Jesus would have, lack of traditional fullbacks, wide wingers and this year's Pep's tactics aren't helping at all.",,,,,"If it were isolated incidents, I'd agree. But it's been happening way too often not to put some blame on Pep",[removed],,,,,,,,,"Spot on about the rushing - trying to force it and it showed. We weren’t ourselves. Also the stop of the build up play is so irritating, they’d be outraged",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He’s only ruining himself sulking playing like shit,We won 4 leagues in 5 years but pep is throwing the 3in a row away for a halaand stat pad against bottom half clubs smh,,,,,,,,,"I come in peace, thiago clearly slipped. The ref let a lot go for both sides. Poor reffing but both teams affected. Salah was clearly fouled at the end, but I can understand why fans don't see it. Great game from both. I really thought we were going to get rinsed by ye today. Nunez man, wtf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,"Atleast jack tries to take on players and move forward. I have not seen bernardo try that in ages now. As for gundo, he is just meh.",,,,,Real isn't exactly lighting it up this season. Lot of the top teams in Europe are looking average.,We've always done this,,,,,,,,,"I do find it funny that you say the ref was bias but the linesman never called the terrible foul Silva committed on Salah.

There is also video of Silva trying to kick/elbow Salah, and than pushing him, which was not reviewed at all. 

People love to use the line ""he let everything go"" but shirt pulling is a clear and obvious foul, of course it will be checked in the build up to the goal if Fabinho was pulled to the ground by his shirt (regardless if he was already falling or not Haaland is stupid to grab his shirt, it's his mistake more than anything).

Plus officials later said that Alisson had 2 hands on the ball so even if Fabinho had not been fouled the goal still wouldn't have stood after that review.

As far as Nunez goes, it was bad. He's able to run the defence but needs to pass instead of always focusing on getting a headline goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

502,"I think what's special about Grealish is how much attention he draws when he carries the ball. He can easily have three guys around him before he tries to release the ball to someone who's been freed up.

But yeah, keeping Foden and Alvarez off today made it seem like Pep forgot he needs to score to win games, not just stop the opposition from scoring.

If we take 3, it's still worth it",,,,,"He willl be sorely missed when he's gone but this team has lost something, and I put that down to Pep micromanaging the players, especially foden grealish and haaland, insisting they keep possession instead of going direct etc.

He and city would have better served if he released the ball earlier to Haaland or whoever was on the right that was free .

But no he had to carry the ball unnecessarily. So Romero gets sent off in the 85th minute.

How did that benefit his team? The beneficiary of this is Spurs' next opponent as Romero will not play.

Therefore, the tactic doesn't work as we're getting run ragged by putting our players in situations they get beat in more often. 

You can position the players in positions where you can hide them all you like in terms of their weaknesses. But when the gap, talent-wise, isn't all that vast, you're actually doing the opposite. And if it's at the expense of our other facets, then, we just look a bit too useless considering the personnel he's persisting with.

Ah well, no point getting overly mad about it as I suspect we'll see a similar lineup next week against Villa and probably win.

When you face against opponents like United playing like West Brom at OT, it’s bound to be difficult as we also don’t want to take too many risks. 

As for their opportunities that united had. it was low % scoring chances. Yes, Rashford may have gotten around Ederson but his angle makes it virtually impossible to score. You’ll have to do a world class curl to the top corner, which is a less than 1% goal scoring chance or lay it off to a better positioned teammate, none of which was arriving fast enough because of how deep United were sitting. 

The other opportunity, Ederson rightly closed the angle and easily dealt with it.


United didn’t trouble us at all. Again, at 1-0, they had impetus to finally come out and play, instead of hiding 10 men like cowards. And again, we were dealing with their toothless attack before that wild decision to allow their equaliser to stand.

Yeah, I mean, I don't think he's had a meaningful shot on target in some time now.

If you give the foul for Fabinho falling over you have to give it for everything like that, including the Bernardo fouls. But they didn't. They only gave it when we scored a goal and ruled it out. 

It's not a city thing, it's a how bad and inconsistent refereeing is. How the rules change only when sigificant things happen. The same happened last week when you played Arsenal and they were giving soft penalties.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

697,,,,,,,we don't have the talent for the defensive tactics.... but he keeps using that as the game plan. like these aren't shut down defenders.

He isn't great at dribbling and passing so we should play to his strengths. It's even worse when both opposition CBs are marking him tightly and we try crossing to him. It's a waste of possession and allows the opposition to break. There were so many instances in today's game where we were overly exposed at the back (multiple times where we were 3 v 2 or 4 v 3). This scoreline could have been worse. I'm hoping that the boys come back with that hunger to keep chasing Arsenal.

There wasn’t a long delay and they didn’t go to the monitor so I thought they just sorted it out on the pitch,,,,,,,,,It was almost like KdB and Cancelo were sharing it. But we parked KdB on the right side and just decided they'd share the position? I don't know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
708,,,,,,,Good to know for next time!,,,,,,,,,My point being Liverpool absolutely don’t have depth. Those 3 players in Liverpool back line wheee the reason they get spanked in Napoli.

I also understand their two obvious chances in the first half were not really going to be ones we concede, but Eriksen played so many penetrating passes that I feel like United had the material for more goals in the first half.

Shouldve scored his 1 on 1 against Eddie and shouldve not had brain lag when being 3 on 1 after Cancelo’s last flop. He had two easy passing options with only one of our CB’s there and instead just botched it. No impact imo, he only fucked chances that other players wouldve used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He wants controlled defense with the ball, and controlled offense. Problem is this controlled offense has been off this season. 
Except Walkers shot we had absolutely nothing. Same vs Southhamton, same vs Brentford, same vs Lpool, i could go on btw. Even the games we have won with Haaland goals etc, we havent really produced too much. There is no clear style or way to produce chances. Are ball rolling is further back compared to earlier seasons.

Would’ve like to see some more efforts from deep. Bernardo gave a couple tips and honestly looked like our best chances for goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
743,,,,,,,"Kids do that to you.

KdB has had some kids over the past few years. 

Won’t be surprised if he is overeating, finishing off his kids food.",,,,,,,,,"Yes so that Foden plays on the RW and we get solidity from him against Robertson who cannot push up because Akanji will not push up as well.

Then, it gives us the chance to hurt Liverpool in their soft spot. We let Milner go off easy. Watch how this same Liverpool will struggle in their very next game proving that Pep went into his City vs Lyon mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
744,,,,,,,"Yeah I am curious too. Or maybe we could be seeing it wrong? Maybe he got more muscles so
he looks thicker.",,,,,,,,,"De Bruyne was barely in the game because he put him on the wing. Yes he's played there before but it's very obviously not his best position.

As for Cancelo, rb (his natural position) or lb he's always a liability defensively but amazing offensively. That's just how he is and always has been since he arrived. Juve fans said this exact thing when we got him too, so it's nothing new.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
745,,,,,,,He shielded the ball from Akanji and basically shepherds the ball to the edge of the area. Is that not interfering?,,,,,,,,,"Listen, I love Gundogan but this was not the game to play all 3. Just off the top we lost scandalously to Tottenham 3-2 with this same experiment. Why use it again when it has clearly shown to fail?

Next, Akanji should be the RB. An inflexible one to keep Robertson in check who will be busy with Foden. Foden tends to have the better of him in their 1 v 1 in that wing.

I am not scapegoating players but we were very susceptible to their counter attacks. Why is that? It is because the work horse (Bernardo) was forced to be everywhere in stead of in the middle to help Rodri. After that, what role is Gundo playing there since his role is being duplicated by Silva?

KdB playing free in that middle then pushes Fabinho and Alcantara to back off pressing Rodri and Bernardo. That frees KdB to look for Haaland or dictate play. 

The game needed Grealish against Milner not Foden who was triple teamed and had to pass backwards. Even if Pep had other ideas in mind, when it was clear it was not working why not change?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
746,,,,,,,"Rightfully so, fucking moronic to say it was right to stand.",,,,,,,,,"Should’ve just started in his natural LB position, don’t fix it if it’s not broken",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
747,,,,,,,"I also started noticing that, why doesn’t he take people on anymore?",,,,,,,,,Who else are you going to play at RB? akanji is a center back. Stones is hurt and even then not preferable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
748,,,,,,,"In 21/22 Foden has the fastest top speed of any player in the PL, he has pace",,,,,,,,,Oh thanks for letting me know I couldn’t watch the game. I think its time everyone admits that cancelo should be only an LB. We need walker or a walker replacement. Really kdb on the wing? Why would he do that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
749,,,,,,,"My comment was more directed to your point about assuming we draw if that was ruled offside. I think we could have saw that game out 1-0 if that was ruled offside, but allowing the goal completely flips momentum. I agree we weren’t playing up to our normal standards, no excuses for that",,,,,,,,,8/10 is being dramatic….,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
750,,,,,,,We are so screwed in CL with no quick strike or pace,,,,,,,,,"I would have preferred Cancelo on the left, but I also consider that this team is versatile enough that a change like Cancelo left or right is normal. He was doing his normal thing just on the right. He just wasn't good today. Neither was KDB. Or Gundo. Or even Foden really. They pressed and we lost the ball. Whether you play Gundo short or long cancelo left or right our performance was sub par. Rodri too. 

We sat on the ball trying to slow the game down by individuals holding the ball instead of making Liverpool chase it.

Even Haaland looked off. Weird touches. Weird posture. Lacked his killer instinct today.

Would I have set the team up differently? Yes. Was this formation abnormal? No.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
751,,,,,,,It was ruled offsides and that's when cunt ass Fernandes ran over to the line judge to throw a tantrum. The official looked like he was trying to run away from the rag players saying that VAR was going to rule on it.,,,,,,,,,I agree,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
752,,,,,,,"Copium? Nah not really. 

I'm all for having a debate about this. I can concede that United (overall) played better, but to say that a team deserves to win just because ""they play better"" is not right as its a results game in the end.

Truth is, City got the first goal and we were playing relatively better, matching MU's intensity. It wasn't until that first MU goal was given that we were rattled.

Yes, a ""world-class"" team wouldn't be rattled, but these unfair calls can really change the game. Personally, I think if it was the other way around and MC scores that kind of goal instead, y'alls MU fans would be crying the same thing. 

So instead of resorting to calling a point being made ""copium"", may you be civilised and have a better discussion of this?",,,,,,,,,Exactly mate I know its dangerous but its not a foul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
753,,,,,,,"Yep. My favorite thing about football is to watch everything that led up to the goal. If we only care about the end product, then we're completely missing the point (according to Pep).",,,,,,,,,"Where does 600m come from? Lmao
I tallied it 300m tops. Weird to say about a team that cost a lot more than that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
754,,,,,,,Ronaldo at his phone can create goals on his own,,,,,,,,,"lol. You don't love Pep more than me but even the best of men is at best, a man.

757,,,,,,,Play better? He has been good but he hasn’t been good enough to justify completely changing our shape just to accommodate him.,,,,,,,,,"Completely agree, considering how defensively solid cancelo is he’s going to have bad games here and there. Just a shame that the timing was to happen in a Liverpool game instead of playing against Everton or soemthing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
758,,,,,,,Fair enough,,,,,,,,,I’d still be pissed that we didn’t score. We didn’t even threaten Robertson at all!! I love Pep man but this is squarely on him. Bad attacking tactics today.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
759,,,,,,,That is not ideal because we have to drop 1 midfielder for that 2 striker => lack control. The best way is we need to buy a left footed leftback so Grealish can play better and Alvarez can play with Haaland too,,,,,,,,,Explains the porcelain gnashers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
760,,,,,,,It's certainly not getting any better. The absolute worst thing about this league.,,,,,,,,,"Nah, it was good. I’ve seen a handful of those this season alone in the PL slotted into the net as an own goal because the defender doesn’t do well enough. VVD kept up with Haaland, positioned himself well, and pushed it over the net. He actually had a decent game, which has been rare this season.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
761,,,,,,,"It's not pity, it's a comment regarding the state of the officiating in the league. 


Let's be honest, you're not even a football fan, so maybe leave the chat to the grown ups who've actually watched football before.",,,,,,,,,"Lmao you're a Liverpool fan in a city sub looking for praise because a defender was able to defend? 

Liverpool players seem to not care about defending these days so I see why you'll applaud even the most basic thing. 

Also, it's not a good cross, another reason why there's nothing world class about the header. 

Maybe 80% of the time in the conference league, I've never seen premier league level defenders fail to head the ball over their own nets.

Van Dijk is a good defender because he can head the ball over his own net has to be the most delusional take, but I'm not sure what I was expecting from a Liverpool fan, you praise your shit 80 million striker for missing sitters because at least he gets into good positions, you'll call him world class for scoring tap ins soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
762,,,,,,,"But I think that’s pretty much always been the nature of our game at the swamp, few chances but a lot of control. It did seem to me that we were getting more fluid and making better chances all the way up to that robbery, and would probably have scored had they not given the goal.",,,,,,,,,"You've won the game, you can keep this foolishness in your sub, why are you not celebrating the clearance in the Liverpool sub?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
763,,,,,,,"I mean, their first comment was fine and you told them to fuck off. It's a question worth asking in terms of Haaland",,,,,,,,,"Ah okay, got it mixed up. Thanks for the correction! Yeah let's hope there's no overthinking this time. Fingers crossed 🤞",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
764,,,,,,,[removed],,,,,,,,,"But then all open play is meaningless:  feel free to carry on playing after a little foul, but the ref will ensure that no goals can result from the following passage of play.

The logical conclusion is that we'll need to start awarding fouls against ourselves in order to avoid wasting time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
765,,,,,,,Nah all us internet people know best. Worlds best midfielder is fat.,,,,,,,,,The ref sets a precedent with how he wants the game to play. Then with a goal scored and with VAR all of a sudden the challenge he deemed ok is not.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
766,,,,,,,"shepherding is overselling it, he didnt touch the ball or guide it anywhere. From what I saw it looked like Akanji could get to the ball and wasnt physically blocked or stopped from getting to the ball.",,,,,,,,,Love to hear it. I always enjoy watching city even when the result doesn’t go our way. And the best part of football (especially supporting city) is the highs that will follow after the lows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
767,,,,,,,"Perhaps be angry at the offside rules instead of a random city fan, how about that?",,,,,,,,,"That’s how we play many times , players always have a slightly different role against different opponents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
768,,,,,,,"Dont know about previous games but today's match up against AWB (who's big, fast and strong) was not a good one for Foden.",,,,,,,,,"We need to stretch the field and having Akanji at RB will make the left side breeze through as Akanji will not go forward. This will make Robertson and Jota more free and they can attack on the right side of City. Having Cancelo there limit Robertson on attacking from the back. This can be seen by how Pep urge Cancelo closing down Robertson when he got the ball.

For me, the tactics ain't wrong. It have the idea behind it but this tactic might work more brilliantly if Laporte played in this game ahead of Ake.

I got the idea of why Pep played Gundo, and he did change the position of Gundo and Bernardo at second half, but, if Bernardo played as Regista, its better for Grealish to fill in the Gundo role instead of having Gundo there, in big games.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
769,,,,,,,"Don’t get me wrong, both goals were absolute shit and shouldn’t have been given, but yeah, we should have been 4 up by man utd second",,,,,,,,,I think var will rewind the whole fucking game if it means us not getting the goal lmao. VAR has fucked us over many times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
770,,,,,,,Yeah I saw that the fucking rat on the sideline was running away from his decision as soon as he made it. Infuriating I really don’t know why I spend my time doing this lol,,,,,,,,,"The problem for this game is, we don't have Walker on the right. I think you need to see this for an in depth analysis.

771,,,,,,,"Here’s the thing though. If you’re not willing to consider the actual results, you can’t pick and choose the results that you want to consider. Utd were just better overall, shut down your side completely in the first half and had good chances. Second half yall scored the goal first, but then let us score 2 (at least 1 if you ignore the “offside” goal). If y’all were actually on course for a win, we wouldn’t be in the position to score those goals regardless. TLDR; the actual results and the performance, both imply we should’ve got 3 points, which we did. Was it a shit decision? Probably but city have multiple decisions that go their way, and multiple that don’t.

781,,,,,,,"Obviously he will alter his approach depending on the defender, but at times the match up between him and the opponent would be in his favour. Yet, he still doesn’t take them on. I do recall though, that Pep wants him to slow down the tempo and be less direct at times. His attacking output has been quite good statistically, but at times i feel like he limits himself. 

These were my observations.",,,,,,,,,"Agreed. I know Grimaldo has been a name that's available, but he's such an offensive profile as well. I'd love a really defensive full back. Seen Malo Gusto talk as well, but he's 19 so that seems more like a developmental target ala Gomez.

Cancelo being able to swap sides gives them flexibility, but it's hard finding someone who is available who really fits that ""defensive"" oriented last man back role that Walker can really cover.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
782,,,,,,,I feel you. My blood is boiling. I'm hopeful though. Pep switched back to the old system and they looked a lot better.,,,,,,,,,Other missed fouls doesn’t make that less of a foul. I’m annoyed at the result. But that was a foul. VAR did it’s job. If that was the other way and Firminio dragged Rodri off the ball I’d be fuming if it wasn’t correctly called a foul.  Take the blue glasses off mate. I fucking hate the scousers but that decision was correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pep tactics fucked us up not Cancelo. We shouldn't  even struggle with Weaker Liverpool side but it happened. There was no pressure from Right side because of Pep tactics.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We lose some of our sting when attacking from the RW but if we switch play like we did to Cancelo all game Foden will have 1 v 1s with Robertson which works in our favor at least 1 critical time. Also, KdB roams in the middle and can turn, do 1-2s with Foden or use his run as a decoy. We get so much from just being safe on that right.

Then on the left, we now have a chance to hurt them where they are clearly weak. Believe me, Liverpool will lose the next away game they play regardless of the team and you'd scratch your head wondering how we could not shred their defensive mistakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

814,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nope. They do stopping us. They double team Haaland and KDB in that game. In the first place, the reason why they put Elliot at the left side is to contain  Cancelo in the first place. Salah played at center in this game.

Real did not change their tactic because they played direct football. Against good opponent, they will go more deeper and counter attack. The same goes with all the team that played direct football. For a possession football, some tweak need to be done. In other day, this formation might be a success and some might failed. We actually not that bad in transition. The only thing that we do badly is after the whole team  shift to a more attacking when we concede.

I think this will help you more, rather than me going to type everything here.

839,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I saw that.. Even You can come up with that easily.. But my problem was why Pep needs to tinker with his winning formula in big games and put players in weird positions. I understand that Cancelo can play at both RB and LB.. But he has been playing at LB for City most of the time and doing extremely well.

Akanji can play at RB .. It's not that we needed RB that badly.

There was no need to play KDB almost like a RW. When he hasn't played that like that this season.

Just play to the players' strengths and trust them. That's all I ask from my manager. Not in a position, where they look lost in a high-pressure game. 

We should have won that game just by virtue of having better players than them if we played our normal game. And bring our game to them.. Instead of reacting to what might they can do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
